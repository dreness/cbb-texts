♪♪ Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo wings for fun.

Ingest, of course, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

That one doesn't make that much sense.

Is it Ingest, like two words, I-N-G-E-S-T?

Not I-N-G-E-S-T, like Ingest Buffalo.

No, Ingest, of course.

Oh, that's interesting.

Maybe it's a play on that.

I mean, that's what you should do.

Cold Bush, thank you for that catchphrase submission.

And welcome to the show.

And...

Yeah.

Hey!

You know!

I'm doing a little De Niro.

A little audible, inaudible De Niro.

Because you couldn't tell it from my impression, but physically right there.

Nope.

Couldn't tell it from looking at you either.

Interesting.

Isn't it what you were doing?

Welcome to the show, Comedy Bang Bang.

This is the best of 2016.

What, you say?

It's January 4th.

Why are they still doing this?

Well, it's because of the calendar.

On January 8th, this Monday, we'll be back to our regular scheduled programming.

But we are in counting down the top episodes of 2016.

It is embarrassing that in 2018, we're still talking about shows from 2016.

It does.

This is mortifying.

Well, it is 2018, though.

That's right.

I forget.

Look, do you have this experience, by the way, across from me, my co-host with the Mohost.

Paul F. Tomkins is here.

Hello, Paul.

Hello, Scott.

Do you have this experience where you sometimes don't know what year it is?

You don't know what's happening.

At what point, that used to be so important to you as a kid.

Well, I don't think I've ever forgotten what year it is.

I have been under a false impression about what day it is many times.

What day do you think it is today?

Oh, is it?

Do you think it's a made up day?

Or do you think it's one of the regular seven days?

I think it's one of the regular seven days.

Okay.

It's June day a day?

No, so you're thinking of made up days.

It's June day.

Fuck.

Paul, you've got nutso.

I've got nutso.

I'm thinking of the Bajernian calendar.

It used to be so important as a kid of like, how old am I?

Of course, I know what year it is based on how old am, because I want to be this age.

Is it Tuesday?

Yes.

Okay.

Not for the listeners.

Today is Thursday, which is our last episode, but for us recording it, we're recording on a Tuesday.

It all started on the holiday times.

It gets weird.

Because you don't have to go to work or what have you.

Yes.

If things are shutting down, why not shutting down, shutting down.

People in Hollywood, especially your agencies, things like that, they look for the earliest possible excuse to- They're all gone.

So this flows the off.

This is the weirdest year too, because the holidays fall on Mondays, so I don't think anyone in chill business is coming back until the eighth.

And they left a million years ago.

There's like no one we can call it.

There's a problem.

Basically.

I know Hollywood emergency.

You know, when Christmas is coming, they go out of the office, fourth of July.

Yeah.

And they come back in March.

You can do it.

By the way, Christmas is coming.

The geese are getting fat.

All of them?

All of every single goose is getting fat.

I'm going to ask you a favor.

If that is the case- Yeah, whatever I can do, whatever I can do.

If you see an old man.

Sure.

I probably will.

You probably will.

Quite honestly.

The city is large as Los Angeles.

The age range in there is quite a wide swath.

Although you don't admit to being over 30 here in LA.

I saw what I thought was a homeless man talking to himself the other day.

It was just someone practicing his monologue.

Anyway, if you've seen old man and he, if he has a hat, would you please put a penny in there?

I don't know that I have one.

Well, I mean, you don't have to do this right now.

I'm saying if you're- It's a cashless society now.

No, I know.

I know.

If you're out there and you do have a penny and you see an old man with a hat, please put a penny in the old man's hat.

I don't know.

Okay.

If you haven't got a penny?

Yeah.

A hay penny will do.

We don't even use hay pennies these days.

Of course I don't have a hay penny.

I mean, with inflation being what it is, people barely have pennies these days.

I don't know.

I don't even think anyone has a nickel, a dime, or a quarter these days, let alone a 50 cent piece.

Are you telling me you don't have a hay penny?

I don't have a hay penny.

Then God bless you.

Thank you so much.

Little late, by the way, this is January- Little late!

Little late for that.

January 4th.

Happy birthday, Dave Foley.

Happy birthday, Dave Foley of the wrong guy.

It's forever in my brain that his birthday is January 4th.

Why is that?

Why would you know his birthday so well?

I don't even know your birthday.

I don't know.

I think it's in October or September.

It is in September?

It's in September.

I barely know anyone's birthday because we're old.

Why are we celebrating birthday?

Your birthday is in June?

No, sir.

You were with me on my birthday this year.

July!

July we were on vacation.

We're on vacation together.

Lolo Lapchus, Paul of Tomkins and myself as well as two other couples that are unimportant.

Below the line.

We all went on vacation to Hawaii together.

Let's talk about this because this is exciting.

We rented a beautiful house in Hawaii.

One of the better vacations I've ever been on.

I absolutely agree.

We had a great time.

Great time.

Great people.

Great environment.

Just a blast the entire time.

A memory that I shall cherish for the rest of my days.

The happy day.

I'm not going to say vacation house.

One of the nicest houses I've ever been in.

It was amazing.

It's crumb-a-lievable.

Let's get ready to crumble!

We know that house, the ins and outs of it, like the back of our hand, we...

We know that house is the ins and outs of it.

The ins and outs of it, like the back of our hand, we're in Hawaii and we didn't even want to leave this place.

We stayed in the house most of the time.

We hung out.

It was great.

It had a beautiful pool in a world of...

Because it was a very comfortable house.

It didn't feel like it wasn't uncomfortable.

It was felt lived in.

Put plainly, we were Ohana.

We became Ohana.

Family.

We became Ohana.

So, we have kept in touch.

You and I, Paul.

No, ever since then.

Everyone who went Hawaii, we've been on a text chain and shocking news out of the Southland.

Tonight at 11.

Flathead.

Point flathead.

Fist.

Hey, this is not a bad name for a bod guest.

Point flathead fist.

One, two, three.

Shocking news came out this November, I believe it was Thanksgiving.

Yes, I think it was.

When one of the people on our text chain that we went to, this...

Can we say her name?

Go ahead.

Trip J yourself.

Trip J.

Jessica D. Jardine texted us in a...

I feel the energy coming off the phone was like she saw this thing and it just had a kinetic energy to this text of like she just grabbed the phone immediately when she saw this.

That's right.

She was on Instagram following one of the various celebrities that she likes to follow.

And who is in our...the very same house that we rented enjoying Thanksgiving but John Legend and Chrissy Teigen.

That's right.

Whoa!

Yeah, that's unbelievable.

We were ready to crumble.

And there was a lot of texting of like are we sure it's the same house?

Yeah, of course.

In every detail.

Yes, we look at various pictures.

There was no mistaking in this.

No mistaking it.

And to be honest, that's an extra level.

I mean, you know, we had a wonderful vacation.

We loved the experience.

But then to know, this is like what the celebrities do.

This we did a thing that was considered okay by these incredibly rich people standards.

Yes.

It was like, well, this validating experience.

We did a good job.

Now I feel bad that I coughed on all the pillows.

That's true.

Well, you know, maybe they can avoid them like the plague.

They should.

We're counting down the episodes of course this year and we've been doing it.

We found out last episode, Engineer Sam is here with us as well.

He's Instagramming himself.

Maybe he's looking up Chrissy Teigen.

I can't tell exactly what he's up to or maybe he's just doing personal business.

Who knows?

You know what?

The engineers when they do these shows, not a free time.

That's right.

All they gotta do is basically look at a computer screen and if that arrow keeps going saying that it's recording, that's about all they need to do.

Do you know on my show, Spontaneous Nation?

Great podcast.

Check it out.

If you're only listening to Comedy Bang Bang for the first time because you read it was popular and you're wondering about it, Paul is the host of his own show, Spontaneous Nation, which is here on the Earwolf Network.

You can get wherever you get your podcasts.

And my regular engineer, typically it'll be Engineer Ryan.

Right, because he created the weirdo machine.

He created the weirdo machine.

That's right.

He came out of the weirdo machine.

That's what I meant to say.

He's the babos bussie.

Oh, that's what you call the weirdo machine?

He created a weirdo.

We went on tour with Ryan and what a guy.

He's a great guy.

And he created your machine that you press buttons for.

The sound machine.

Yes.

Sound machine.

Yes.

He did this in Miami, I believe.

The Miami sound machine.

Come on baby, do do do that.

Come on.

It's not only the rhythm that's going to get you.

Anyway, when he's the default engineer for my show.

He's the default or?

He's done almost every episode.

Not by default, but he's the one that you normally want to do it with.

Oh no, I would have picked so many other people.

No, he's the best.

I meant like he's the regular guy.

Yes, I think maybe on one hand I can count the times that he hasn't done the show.

Try to do it.

So how many are we talking 20 and you can do it on one hand?

Oh, crippling.

I can't.

I'll be honest.

That's going to ruin your flat hand.

I can't ever get up to four without experiencing intense crippling pain.

Yeah, it's that middle finger.

You've been using it too much.

Flipping the burn.

I've been traffic a lot.

Anyway, when it's traffic at 11.

Point of play and best.

When he engineers my show, he is enrapped.

He loves it.

He closes all.

He just watches the show.

Quite honestly, this is one of the greatest shows on earth.

People have paid to be here.

You've got Sam over here.

What Instagram are you looking at?

Where are you looking at?

Go ahead and get on Mike.

This is a special time of year all allow the engineer to get on Mike.

Usually if it's a Cody or someone like this, we're shutting it down.

Sam, go ahead.

Get on Mike.

This is your big opportunity.

What were you looking at?

When you looked over I was on Hannah Simone's.

Who is that?

She's on the new girl, right?

Why were you looking at Hannah Simone's Instagram?

I was scrolling through.

Yeah, but why are you looking at hers?

Are you a friend of hers?

Oh no, this is someone I follow.

I would like to be friends.

You're a fan of Hannah Simone.

I have never reached out though.

You've never, well, I mean, hey, Hannah Simone, if you're listening and who knows, she might be.

Hannah Simone, I'm sorry, I didn't know what the show's good enough for my apology.

My apologies.

Show's good enough for Tatiana Maslani, but not good enough for you.

Right.

Good enough for Neil Patrick Harris.

Hannah Simone, who I believe we asked to be on the TV show a few times and never took us up on it.

You may be listening.

Into your Sam's over here.

He's a, I'm not even trying to set up a dating kind of thing, but he's a great guy.

I would hang out with him.

So, you're a girlfriend though, right?

I do.

But I mean, she cool.

She's not.

She's a not cool.

Not cool in the way you're talking about.

We're in the way that I'm talking about.

Hannah Simone, she seems like a nice person, right?

Hey, I think so.

Yeah, and I come through for my Instagram.

Yes, I only follow a nice people.

And Sam, you're a nice person.

You're a person that I think would be fun to hang out with socially.

Thank you.

I would go on tour with you.

I'd go on tour with you.

Just me?

Yeah, just you.

Just three of us.

Just the three of us.

The Southern Castles and the Sky.

We're going to try.

Paul, we got to talk about it.

Sam, turn that mic right down.

Do we have to talk about Bill Withers and how sad his name is?

When you think about it, come up with a stage name.

We have to build.

Oh, boy.

The bill.

The bill decomposing.

Come on, Withers.

It's probably my favorite video of that Fox.

Oh, I love that video.

I love that Fox decomposing.

Whenever I'm having a bad day, I just turn on that video of the Fox decomposing.

I'm like, wow, that's going to be me someday.

Exactly.

I assume Vigorskrosz really puts it in perspective.

Paul, we got to talk about it.

Let's talk about it.

Top music.

Talk about it.

Let's talk about it.

We got to talk about something that we've talked about several years in a row here.

We got to talk about a little something called the Mr.

Microphone.

Toy.

Paul, I'm hitting you with a surprise here.

You may have forgotten about it.

I certainly haven't.

We got to talk about this.

Well, I haven't forgotten about it because I haven't been allowed to forget about it.

Yes.

Throughout the year, here's what happened.

Okay.

But first of all, let's backtrack and talk about the Mr.

Microphone toy.

Yes.

For a bit.

Absolutely.

Okay.

When we were children and we were children, right?

We were.

We were just born this way.

No.

No, we were the opposite of Lady Gaga.

That's right.

When we were children first and then we grew.

Is that what that song means?

Yes.

She's saying like, I was born a full grown adult.

That's weird.

Which is just really distressing on the weirdo box.

But when we were children, we were both obsessed with a certain commercial that was on television.

Yes.

And a product that is one of the most disappointing products, I believe, of all time.

Absolutely.

We've each gotten, Christmas was just last week.

We've both gotten disappointing presents.

Have you ever gotten or given a disappointing present?

Almost exclusively both.

Right.

That was hard to say.

There was a time period where I think I was giving, by the way, what I found out with at least with Coolop, I don't want to generalize and say, with women don't do this, but I gave Coolop two purses.

I believe I gave her one and my parents gave her one very early in our relationship.

And the look of just disgust on her face when she got them was, I mean, it was where to the point where I had to apologize to my family.

I feel like she was so disgusted by the purse choice.

And I was like, oh, I thought that I could pick out a purse.

I have to ask now because, Hey, Coolop, maybe your wife, but she's my friend.

Sure.

And you want a defender?

I feel like I'm, I'm, was it that she was trying not to have a look of disgust at her face?

No, I, it was one of those things where I don't think she was pretty young at the time.

I don't think she had learned how to mask emotions or something or maybe it was just something about purses.

This might be purse and all to her, but it, it, it, but it made me realize I was like, Oh, I can't shop.

Thank you.

I can't shop for purses for Coolop because I guess I don't know anything about purses because it's like, it's like, if you, if you've ever watched project runway, I have, you know, you know, this is great.

I have watched that.

Okay, great.

You know how several times they'll say to a designer, like you need to raise your taste level.

Yes.

And to a non designer, we don't know what that means.

We're just like, and that's the point is when you have seen shitty dresses and good dresses enough to know like, Oh, that's a shitty one that everyone makes these mistakes.

Yeah.

This is a good one.

It's much, it can be like that with, with writing, uh, in writing comedy where you're like, Hey, you know, everyone makes these types of jokes or everyone writes these types of sketches.

You're bad.

Get the fuck out of my office.

You're fired.

Yes.

I learned that that I always thought purses were just purses.

And why should it be you and I should get along so often.

But so I, so I bought a purse and it was like, this is the worst present you've ever given me immediately returned.

And then my, then I believe my parents bought her a purse and it was just like, just, just this look, yeah, but don't fall far from the tree.

What does that mean?

The ocaromans.

Notoriously the worst person that you're saying that her parents, her parents acted terribly when they got bad gifts.

What if it's just a terrible combination of things, your family's terrible buying purses, her family's terrible receiving purses.

I don't know what I honestly, it was, it was so strange to the point where I was like, I have learned that and I was generalizing as a man, I guess I cannot buy purses.

The, I'll just leave out.

Now what we do is I say, cool up, pick what you want me to buy you and I'll, and I'll buy this thing because I have no idea.

Good purse, bad purse.

Right.

Have you ever played good purse, bad purse?

Done a long time.

We should do that with an ex, ex-suspen.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah, yeah.

That sounds good.

But so I, I, I went through a run of just giving like, just feeling like I gave terrible gifts and I was always late with buying them, you know, like the, the holidays, they sneak up.

I remember one year I didn't get an opportunity to go shopping until Christmas Eve and I didn't know that the stores all close early on Christmas Eve.

So I went into the department store and was like, all right, let's get all our shopping done.

I know I have like three hours I can do this and I hear on the, the intercom we're closing in 20 minutes.

I was like, fuck.

All I could get was like movie gift certificates for people.

If this were, if, if in the hallmark movie, you would be the boyfriend that gets dumped.

Yes, I would because, or I would be the boyfriend who needs to learn a lesson because I'm too focused on work work.

Why did I mispronounce that?

Also in the Sinemax, a skin a max movie, I would be the husband that the wife would want to experiment with a gardener on.

Yeah.

Because he's always like, honey, I gotta go off to the office.

Sorry, babe.

So you've given poor gifts.

I, yeah, I, I would say that with my wife, Jamie, I feel like I do good every other year.

Right.

So I hear I score with like, this is a great present.

And it's, it's, you know, like someone outside the box where it's like, I did not see the wrap.

You got a wrap.

I heard my past about spinach.

I read your article.

And then this last year was a great year.

Uh oh.

So 2017, we have, we're, by the way, not to give this away, but we're, we're taping this in advance of Christmas.

Do you know what?

Last year was actually 2016 was a, um, a combo good and bad year because we traveled to North Carolina, Asheville, North Carolina.

And the thing that I'd ordered her wasn't going to arrive until after Christmas.

I, two years ago, that happened to me where I was in the middle of that insane run of, of filming the show.

And I think we did the Emmys as well.

And I just like, it was one of those things where I just got to it late and every single get, I was like, cool up.

Everything is now due to come on like the 28th.

Yeah.

Sorry.

Yeah.

And it, and not received well.

That news was not received well.

Well, I got in Asheville, I bought a bunch of sort of placeholder gifts, like smaller things.

One of, one of which was a big score, but then when the big gift came, which was this coat that I saw that I was many colors, many colors, coat of one color.

Okay.

All right.

Maybe, maybe two.

Um, I, it was one of those things where I was like, I think she would look great in this.

I don't, I honestly don't know if she's going to like it or not clothes.

I guess you fucking love this.

She loved it.

Oh, wow.

She's still aware to this very day.

What coat is this?

That's J.D.

Wars.

It's a, um, it's a navy coat, double breasted with like, yeah, it's like a, it's like a long ladies pea coat.

Is it really?

Yeah.

Interesting.

It's very smart.

I got to see this thing on her.

It's very smart.

Why didn't she come by?

Tell her to come by tonight.

Hey, honey, come over here where you're fucking.

I don't mean here.

I mean in my house.

Tell her to come by my house tonight in the peak and bring the coat.

Hey, what?

What is this?

What do you mean?

I want to see her on this coat.

Are you making me a cook?

I'm cooking you, bro.

Don't cook me, bro.

So poor gifts have been part of our lives for many, many years now.

And there is no poor gift in my opinion than the Mr.

microphone.

Based upon the very premise of these commercials.

Can I say I feel, because we've been here all day doing these.

Yes.

Now I'm crippled by self doubt.

I feel like was that present talk interesting to anyone?

And I apologize if it was not.

I think it was.

I think people are interested in our lives.

That made me uncomfortable.

Mr. microphone, let's talk about this.

And Sam, you're holding up a phone.

I don't know whether you're doing personal message.

Did you have a message?

What do you got?

You got a Mr. microphone commercial?

Did you want me to track it down?

No, because I bet that this is the one that we use every.

But look how nice he is to his physically.

He's finally listening.

He's a team player.

Team real team player at the very end of the game.

You know, he's like the fucking third character I'm throwing shade.

He's like, really?

Yeah.

Are you famous on throwing shade?

He's like, are you like bread on who charted?

Yes, exactly.

I'm scared of that happening on this show.

That's why we'll not allow them to talk.

Thought I said, turn down that microphone, Sam.

I don't like on Hollywood handbook, whatever Ryan's doing it, and they make Ryan talk.

I don't like it.

Don't like it at all.

I believe Sam, not to shut you down, but I think you brought up the one instance of this commercial that is on YouTube, which we'll get to why I don't want to see it in a minute.

But keep it from my sight.

The Mr. microphone commercial that we that Paul and I both watched as children.

Yeah, as children, little children.

This is the promise of Mr. microphone that you are going to buy this microphone.

What it basically is, is a microphone that what they promised you was that you would be able to walk by someone listening to the radio, turn on your microphone, usurp the very airwaves themselves, and hijack like a pirate radio station, hijack their radio, and talk directly to these people who would be so surprised and not afraid of you and not thrown by this, that they would fall into your arms and fall in love with you.

Is that right, Paul?

They would be delighted.

They would be they would love that.

They would say finally someone is harnessed this technology.

Yes.

Finally.

I've been waiting for someone to talk to me via my radio.

What is the promise of Mr. microphone when you're a kid?

When you're a kid, it looks like the greatest invention in the world.

But this is also not to we can't discount this for little boys like you and me.

It's not just the hijacking of the airwaves, but it's also hearing your voice amplify.

Hearing your voice amplify a microphone.

It's like when people, you know, they they go to see a sporting event and a camera catches them.

Yeah.

And they say, I'm famous.

Like there's some allure to being on the radio, being on the television, not so much podcasts.

Scott, can I say no, no one cares.

Can I tell you walkie talkies?

They're still walking talking.

There's still a thing.

Well, I'm not that formal.

There's still a thing that entrances children about walkie talkies, even in the age of cellular telephone communications.

Just communications.

It's why when you go to war, they try to knock out the communications first because everyone loves them.

They're having so much fun and they're like, let's ruin their day.

So we would see these commercials about Mr. Microphone, where there were a variety of situations where the owners of this product were amplifying their voices on radios.

In a home.

In a home, certainly.

And people and this at a party walking down the street.

Just the other day.

And Mr. Microphone came their way.

And of course, a car.

And the situations were at a party.

Hey, I'm going to get on the microphone.

Everyone's going to be like, whoa, you got a microphone in your house?

Which is not typical house.

Whoa.

A kutramal.

Yeah, no, it's not.

You sinks.

Everyone's got those.

Let's run it down.

Toillets?

Toillets.

Windows.

I hope you have a door.

Kitchen counter.

Floors?

I hope so.

Otherwise, you're going to the center of the earth, my dear boy.

Silverway drawer.

I said the Civil Rights drawer.

The Civil Rights drawer where you celebrate a loving day by pulling out your marriage certificate.

Your junk drawer.

Junk drawer.

Toillets.

Did I mention toillets?

You did.

Of course.

You're very fond of them.

I love them.

Stairs sometimes.

Stairs sometimes if we were now around to things in some homes.

Okay.

Backyard.

Frontyard.

All around the house.

A rooftop pool.

Wet bar.

These are things every home has.

But microphone?

Oh.

Nagada.

Not in those days.

Nagada.

Not in those days.

So that's very impressive.

Walking down the street.

That's very impressive.

But the one that stuck out in Paul and I, the minds of two young boys such as Paul and I was where a gentleman and I think he was a gentleman.

I think he was a gentleman.

He was a perfect gentleman.

In this situation he acted like a perfect gentleman.

He was a galant.

Respectful.

Mm.

Shivalrous.

Of course.

A perfect gentleman.

He in my, in my, my recollection of it is, it's a G.

You're saying you're rectum.

My rectum.

Am I rectum?

It's a Jeep.

In my rectum is a Jeep.

No, my recollection is that the gentleman was in a Jeep.

Something without a top.

Certainly a convertible.

He pulled, he saw two women walking on the sidewalk.

I'm not going to say it down the street.

That's the other day.

In my recollection they were wearing swimsuits.

Is that yours as well?

Scott, can I tell you?

Yeah.

My recollection has changed.

What?

Yes.

Since the very last time we talked about this one year ago?

Yes.

Here's what I see now in my mind.

Is this because you've watched the commercial in question so many times?

I think it must be.

It may be have influenced this a little bit.

But I'm retreating to my memory palace.

And what I see there is two gentlemen in a convertible.

Convertible.

We are seeing the back of the car.

One gentleman who is holding the Mr. microphone and he is driving.

Is he driving or is he the passenger and he is a perfect gentleman?

Just a perfect gentleman.

He is turning around facing the camera.

Facing the camera, yes.

And saying into Miss Yolem de Chafon.

Lala.

Hey, good looking.

We'll be back to pick you up later.

But I can no longer see those women.

You can no longer see the women.

I'll tell you why, Paul, because the most famous iteration of this commercial, which engineer Sam just pulled up, is the one that is on YouTube, only has the men in the car never, you never see the women.

So he could be saying this to anything.

He could be saying it to men.

He could be saying it to women.

He could be saying it to like two potted plants that are sitting there.

He could be talking to the cameraman.

He could.

And God damn it, I bet he is.

This is the version that is the most famous version, the one that is out there.

But Paul and I, and maybe you've changed your tune on this, but somehow in my recollection of this commercial, I've seen the women.

I believe the women are in this commercial.

And you're in this commercial.

Me, me too.

Hashtag.

I also remember that.

I remembered that.

Now let me ask you about this version of the commercial.

Yes.

Is there a gentleman walking down the street with a radio, a radio?

A booming box.

It's not quite a booming box, but a portable.

But he's walking on the street with the radio and he's singing jingle bells.

That is in, that is in one of the versions that I've seen.

Now when we started talking about this, we, several years ago, we talked about it on the best ofs, we mentioned this commercial and didn't even think to look it up really until like maybe last year or the year before.

What was the need?

We remember this commercial.

We remembered the commercial.

Now since then, we've been talking about it so many years that we looked it up and we were shocked, made, dismayed, defined.

They horrified.

That the, the example of this commercial that is currently on the internet and indeed YouTube, these women are nowhere to be found.

No where to be found.

It's like a, it, it's like a reverse god flip, godless on Netflix.

I'll let's get it together.

What are you trying to say?

Some of it are godflakes.

Godflakes.

You know what?

If I were a Christian instead of Netflix where there's so much filth, I'd love godflakes.

That's a good business.

So we, we, and we've talked about this where we, we, we are sure, or at least I am sure there is a version of this commercial out there that was the second version of the commercial.

The commercial has gone through several versions over the years.

Yes.

That there is a version out there that has the women, that we see the women's reactions and they're delighted by this man.

I, I choose, because it is delightful.

I choose to believe that.

Yeah.

Now here's what has happened.

Was it this year that it's happened or was it the previous year?

It was the previous year.

Ever since we talked about this on the show, all people do now and it, and to be honest, some people are doing it now because they know it irritates us and they, and they are trying to poke at us.

And what's funnier than irritating people that you admire or it's not admire, at least you know, enjoy it.

You get free entertainment from, but, but it, it also happens at least every couple of weeks where it's someone doing it genuinely.

Yeah.

It's been, does a most times a still of a popular cartoon program.

I don't even want to say the name.

I don't want to, but I'm going to.

Oh, okay.

The Simpsons.

Yeah.

And they say, Hey, you're thinking of this Simpsons episode and where you see the women, it was a parody of this commercial.

They say, Hey, good looking.

We'll be back to pick you up later.

And you see the women in this commercial.

Yeah.

And our point is no, we're not.

Yeah.

No, we're not.

We're thinking of a filmed live action, real life human being, not drawn.

Yes.

Commercial.

Yeah.

Because that's the one we remembered from childhood, not the Simpsons.

And by the way, the Simpsons obviously remembers it because they drew it in their parody.

This is the point.

Please don't send us the Simpsons thing anymore.

I know we're in for another now month of it.

Yeah.

Why are we talking about this?

That was a mistake.

It's a Christmas tradition.

People love to hear us talk about Mr. microphone.

Anyway, my point is when you get the, when you get the Mr.

microphone, the radio in question has to be tuned to a frequency usually 89.1 or something, a radio station that has no radio station on it.

No radios would be...

Nobody's driving around listening to that.

No.

It's basically good for you to tune your own radio to this Mr. microphone station and amplify your own voice on your own radio.

Can I say this to Scott?

And this might be divisive.

And I don't want this to drive a wedge between us.

Okay, I hope not.

I don't think I was under the impression that you could just hijack people's sound.

I think we've talked about this.

This is maybe my issue.

Might be your issue.

But I believe in the Simpsons episode in question, the same thing happens.

And that's why I was so, I related to it so much when I saw this particular episode is they buy a Mr. microphone and they are disappointed in the fact that you can't just broadcast your voice on any radio.

Yes.

So for me, that's not the main reason to just like Mr.

microphone.

The main reason is it's shitty.

It is a shitty product.

Plus, it's like just buy a regular microphone and an amp.

Yeah, kids.

You can't afford an amp?

Save your paper route money.

Seriously, or go like, you know, do...

Can't afford an amp?

Just staff up on a sitcom.

If you need some extra money.

Hey, just go to Harvard.

We're going to Lampoon.

We end up writing for the Simpsons to do it.

Yes, it's as easy as you move on to something else.

Well, there you go.

We've talked about Mr. microphone and I'm happy we did it.

Cross it off the list.

Santa, you can cross this off your list.

We have to get to our first episode.

We haven't got to do our first episode of the countdown.

Can you believe it?

I can believe it.

Let's get to it.

This is, we're counting down your top four episodes of Comedy Bang Bang this year.

This is very exciting.

This is your episode four.

Number four.

All right, episode four.

And this is a great one.

I'm very excited for this.

Yes, Paul.

Bit of a cliffhanger from last best of episode that we just did.

Yum on.

If I'm not in any of these top four episodes.

You're going to awwww.

Hulk out!

Yeah.

You're going to be very upset.

You're going to be very angry.

Mm-hmm.

You're up to this point you have been in how many stops have you been in six of the six of the six of the seven.

And you were out of eleven appearances.

And you were only in eleven appearances this year.

And six of them are in the top sixteen.

That's an amazing achievement.

I mean, it's not for me to say.

You should be happy full stop just right there.

I should be, but I'm not.

You're not.

No, I won't be.

You won't be.

Would it surprise you to learn that you are not in this episode number four?

I mean, it won't surprise me so much as...

I won't rage you.

I won't rage yet.

If I end up not being in any of the top four.

Mm.

I will be very angry.

Okay.

All right.

We'll see.

This is episode five hundred and eleven from October two of this year, another recent one.

Do I auto break?

And this is an episode called the more zook-snick interruption.

And this is Jason Manzuchas and Nick Kroll and myself.

All being ourselves.

A lot of times when Nick comes by, he'll do characters.

He was just himself this time.

That's right.

He was hyping his new show, Big Mouth, of which I, from what I understand, from what people have sent to us.

That there are two characters who are drawn exactly like us and yet have totally different voices.

Your take?

But at least he's raising all that money for Puerto Rico.

Or...

That whole thing was very hazy.

Yes.

Now, why do you need to be a character when you have the return of one of the most classic comedy bang bang characters of all time since the beginning of, since the early days of doing this show, Seth Morris, the return of Bob Dooka.

Sure.

The return of Bob Dooka.

Bob Dooka.

How long had it been?

It had been a while.

It had been something that I had written to Seth periodically every three months or so over a couple of years and said, hey, maybe time for Dooka to come back.

And Seth always had something going on.

He was working on Bajillion.

He was a writer on Bajillion.

That's right.

And director.

And director, that's right.

He's a great director.

And the timing never really worked out.

But he was always saying, I want to.

I want to.

And the fans wanted him to come back.

They got Dooka Delirium.

And they, if you don't know who Bob Dooka is, it's a character Seth Morris has been doing for a while.

And I saw him do it at the UCB Theater here in Los Angeles.

And it's a great character.

And we were talking about it on a previous episode.

Seth's brain works in a different way than a lot of people and a lot of comedians and improvisers brain.

The things he's into are very different things.

His hobbies, the things he reads, he has a lot of information about certain things.

Like he did an episode a few years back where he was like, hey, I'm going to do a character based on ASMR.

Is that what it's called?

And I had never heard of it.

He's on the forefront of things like odd wellness practices and things like that.

So he's got a very interesting background, but he's created this character Bob Dooka, who the very first time he did it on the podcast.

I was saying like, hey, basically I'd had on people like yourself doing impressions of famous people.

And it was kind of like a show where it was a variety show, but about interviewing famous people, real famous people and fake famous people.

And so if I would ever have a non-famous person on there, I would say like, maybe there's a reason why you're on it.

Like, maybe you're my stepdad or something.

And so we made him my stepdad on the show just to give me a reason to be talking to him in those early days.

Anyway, it's a fascinating character.

And one thing that he does is he does these lists where he comes and he brings these lists.

And this was a great one.

And it was great immediately upon release of this episode, people were so happy that Bob Dooka was back and he had another great list.

So let's hear a little bit of it.

Episode number four, who's someone just walked in?

I apologize for that.

Bob, I'm sorry, everyone out there.

This is my ex-stepfather.

He was married to my mother for six months.

Gloria.

Basically father, deep father figures.

I'm here to fill that father-size hole in your heart.

Well, you haven't been filling it recently.

I haven't seen you in so long.

I know, I know, and I can explain.

I've been out of commission for quite a while.

It turns out I'm suffering from an er-sign dementia and combination grisly depression where I hibernate for many years at a time.

Wow, an er-sign?

What's an er-sign?

It's a bear.

So it's a combination between an er-sign and a grisly?

Er-sign dementia.

Grisly depression.

Oh my gosh.

So you suffer from UD-G-D?

Correct.

That sounds unfair.

I heard a whole thing about an NPR about Ogduggi, and it is brutal.

I mean, we were in Uggi-Duggie for a while.

Now we're tip-teeping on to Duggie.

Yeah, and Duggie-Duggie.

It sounds unbearable.

Did it...

Oh, Nick.

Did it come upon you very suddenly?

You didn't leave a note.

You didn't let anyone know where you were going.

No, you did.

It did come on me suddenly.

Quite suddenly.

And, you know, before I knew it, I thought...

Did it come on you forcefully?

It did, and it made me think it was my fault.

So you just disappeared one day?

I did.

We had plans.

We did have plans.

We were going to play catch, but I was scared.

Right.

Why?

Him throwing something at me.

Well, then why make a plan to play catch?

Because that's what fathers do.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, I never had a father to play catch with me, and I did, but...

And we did.

Oh.

So...

Well, that's confusing.

If you had to have a catch, what ball would be the least frightening to you?

Probably a tape ball, like a piece of tape watered up.

Oh, like a...

It's a...

What about a Nerf ball?

What about a Nerf...

Like a little soft Nerf balls?

That'll just go right into me and mold into me.

You have very, very soft skin in order.

Very porous skin.

Yes.

I've been diagnosed with Kitchen Sponge skin.

Kitchen Sponge skin.

Mmm.

Kitchen Sponge skin?

Kitchen Sponge skin.

It stinks after about a day.

And you can run it through a microwave.

You can run it through a microwave.

To kill the bacteria.

Mmm.

But somehow that bacteria keeps coming back.

Mmm.

That's why they call it bacteria.

Mmm.

I don't understand.

That also explains how...

Because the back, your back, I can see a little bit of your back, is very coarse.

Yeah, it's like a gorilla.

It's like a...

Like a...

Yeah, like a leaner.

Yeah, sure.

Like a...

That's the case of a brillo back.

Yeah.

And then I was in a washroom college and had no idea.

Oh, wow.

So you were gone.

I was gone for quite a while and I figured out what...

So er-sign dementia and grizzly depression are just symptoms of a larger issue that I was having.

Turns out I was suffering from male menopause.

Oh.

What exactly is...

I've heard of female menopause very just...

Well, menopause, it's a similar thing.

I've heard anecdotal men.

Isn't that man who said your favorite porn category is?

I read...

Maybe.

Man, I hope you're not watching pornography.

I did look Bob.

I'm not a young man.

After this is a...

Correct you.

I am going to make you watch all the pornography until you've got it out of your system.

Oh, like...

Fine, let's make a date to do that.

That would be...

Let's just do that right now.

Yeah.

No, Bob, I want to hear about male menopause.

Male menopause.

Well, what is this?

Well, I looked up the symptoms and I have every one of these.

Oh, no.

They're following.

What are...

Yeah, what are the symptoms?

Are just some of the symptoms.

A male menopause.

Male menopause.

Weight gain.

Incontinence.

Bloating.

Depression.

Disturbing memory lapses.

Disturbing pearl lapses.

Breast pain.

Titty ache.

Nipple throw up.

Stretpex.

Arial abola.

Irritability.

Hot flashes.

Warm flushes.

Cold.

Squish.

Night sweats.

Mid-morning armpit pisses.

Afternoon de wipes.

Irregular periods.

La salavito.

Irrito dryness.

Deep vein thrombosis.

And the last one is a little bit more.

The last one is a little bit more.

My band horn section infection.

Changes in body odor.

Tingling extremities, including, or also known as, sprite fingers.

Soda stream feed.

And bubble dick.

I have each and every one of those systems.

Oh.

So it can only be male menopause.

One thing I should tell the listeners who haven't, I mean you haven't been here in so long.

We have so many new listeners.

My ex-step father Bob.

A bit of a hypochondriac.

I mean we talked about Jason being one.

Sure.

You self-diagnosed hypochondriac.

Although you tend to get the things that you diagnose.

It's hypochondriac with a coexisting illness of manifestation disease.

Yeah.

It's like instead of the secret it's like the secrete.

Exactly.

Wow.

Exactly.

Wow.

Does that make sense?

It does.

Sure.

Not funny, but it makes sense.

Oh, it's very funny.

It's very, it makes very much sense.

Mm-hmm.

Wow.

I think it's a lot that I'm dealing with.

Bubble dick especially.

It's gotta be very...

Main vein thrombosis.

Yes, these are all, believe me, it's hard to go to the YMCA.

Oh.

To drain my main vein thrombosis.

Yeah.

Absolutely.

Is it hard?

Well you have to go, each county has a different registered main vein thrombosis drainage center.

Okay.

You have to register there.

Now do they have those centers all over in all 50 states?

Most of them are at KOA campgrounds.

Okay.

So they have to...

They're lying crotch down at a KOA campground.

Next to where the RVs dump their sewage.

It's a medical procedure.

Okay.

You are just raining the main vein thrombosis.

Yes.

Right.

Exactly.

If your thrombosis center is knocking, rocking means you're...

Knocking?

I'm just racking.

Yeah.

Knocking, racking?

Well Bob, this is, I mean, I guess I should forgive you for...

Please do.

For being gone and standing me up that day.

You're obviously dealing with a lot.

I am dealing with a lot, but you know what I am trying to...

I'm trying to deal with it the best way I can and I was recently put on a new series of anti-depressant medications.

Oh, oh good.

How's it working for you?

I mean...

I'm glad you asked.

What are you taking?

You know, it's so ironic that you asked that because I happen to have a list.

Oh, of the cocktail of drugs that you're currently taking?

The cocktail of drugs that I'm currently taking.

Oh, okay.

So you're going to read what drugs you're taking?

Yes, if I may.

In list form.

Mm-hmm.

So this is a list then of the drugs you're taking.

I don't know if it's so much a list as it is a column of one words at a time.

Okay.

Well, I'll take them as I can.

And are these...

The following, okay.

Are medical pills that are helping me through my male menopause and deep, deep depression?

Prozac.

Mm-hmm.

It's a lot of pain.

If XR.

It works all.

Buse bar.

Gary Buse bar.

Abilify.

AptoZoot is that a pain.

LexaPro.

LexaAmature.

Wellbutrin.

Elavil.

Master Beta Caratine.

Netflix, Bingeamoles.

Lovex.

Hugsall.

Cuddlerite.

Warm Fuzzyline.

Selectia.

Conflictan.

Interwarsyline.

St. John's Wort.

St. Vincent's it.

St. Bernardicles.

Martin Scarelli.

Jellybeans.

And Robert Downey Jr.

Mintz.

Oh, and they're helping.

They're helping.

You have to find the right combination, the right dosage.

Oh, oh, oh.

Wow, and even just the inaccurate dosage on one of those.

I will jump off the nearest bridge.

What is the nearest bridge?

It's near a kitty pool.

So, fortunately, it works out.

Oh, okay.

Are the Martin Scarelli jellybeans expensive or are they?

They're very, very expensive.

Yeah, the price shot up recently.

I don't know why.

Well, this is...

Wow.

I mean, I'm glad it's helping, Bob, because I worry about you.

My mother doesn't really ask me.

No, she doesn't ask about you anymore.

I mean, we presumed you were dead, quite honestly.

That's a safe bet.

It really is.

Like 90% of the time, any day.

For those years, there was hibernating like a bear.

How long, like, is this like a Rip Van Winkle scenario?

Have you been asleep for years?

Are you a time traveler?

Or did you age appropriate?

Well, I'm a time traveler in the sense that I get really depressed.

I go to sleep and then it's four years later.

Okay.

So in that sense, yes.

Yes, right.

Did you eat a bunch to prepare for your hibernation?

Yes, yes.

What do you...

Yeah, what does one eat when one knows...

It's funny you should ask.

Just stumbled on that one.

Prior to my most recent hibernation, I was trying a different diet to deal with some of my anxieties.

Scott, as you know, I've suffered from body image issues and dietary...

Describe your body for those...

I mean, a lot of people are newcomers to you, Bob.

What exactly is your body...

Visually speaking.

Well, I don't know if anybody has been near an industrial mayonnaise factory.

And they have the sacks of rejected mayonnaise baking out in the sun in the back out of the bed.

Oh, yeah, I've seen that.

Basically, you put a hat on that.

You got yourself a bad duke.

A rejected mayonnaise sack?

Mm-hmm.

You rancid mayonnaise nightmare?

Exactly.

Yeah.

It's how you would describe your body.

Mm-hmm.

Got it.

Do you say ejectly?

I did not, but that's a good one.

Mm-hmm.

Anyway, my spiritual nutritionist put me on a diet.

The philosophy of Shriebo on a Bogdanovitch employs...

It's a ripening the idea that you are what you eat.

Now, if you consume unhealthy foods, you will be an unhealthy person.

You consume processed foods filled with preservatives.

You will be shallow and live a long time.

If your diet is high in sugar, you will be superficially dynamic but lack substance.

And if you eat cat food, you will hate mice and think you're better than human beings.

This is an easy concept, I understand.

Mm-hmm.

Shriebo on a banana has done is developed a dietary system that emphasizes not just how we feel physically, but how we feel emotionally.

So, she put me on a diet to make me feel special, unique.

It's the endangered foods, endangered species diet.

Oh, wait a minute.

The endangered species diet.

Where you're only eating endangered species.

Correct.

Only, only as a way to feel special because you are what you eat.

I see.

Okay, I see.

That would also make you endangered.

I hadn't done that part of the math.

But you are what you eat if you're eating endangered species mustn't you then be yourself endangered?

Well, that's not what we focus on.

What we focus on is what's special about...

Are you being hunted right now, Bob?

Do you think?

I will say that that Bach-Bach-Bach was human-sized.

Yeah.

Okay, wait, did you see Fogghorn Lego or not?

There are poachers outside right now.

Yeah.

And they all do look like southern roosters.

Yeah.

This is a problem.

This is going to be a problem.

Okay.

Well, let's not get such too much.

Yeah.

What are some of the endangered species that you're eating?

Okay.

May I read them to you in this form?

Are you going to read all of these simultaneously, these words or one after the other?

How are they...

Do them all simultaneously?

How are they presented?

Are they presented?

Yeah, on the page.

Is it alphabetical or is it in terms of what you eat most to least, least to most?

Or is it in the water that I eat these every morning?

Got it.

Okay.

So this is only what you eat in the morning or from morning until...

This is just the morning.

Got it.

Okay.

Let's hear this list.

The following is a column of words that put together.

Pick up my endangered species diet.

Bobcat eggs.

Tiger bacon.

Bush Viper pancakes.

A daily bowl of seahorses.

Star-nosed mow-long gluten-free crackers.

Three bean orangutan.

Chimbiscuits.

Lamb biscuits.

Fred Durst.

Really?

He's endangered?

Wow.

Just a...

You haven't heard much from him, at least.

I'm just longer than the other.

I think there's only one left on Earth.

Yep.

You've been to...

He's known as Earth's Durst.

I have to start over now.

Okay, no, no, no.

Please.

Jason will be quiet.

Bluefin tuna.

Big-eye tuna.

Alba Cortuna.

9-11 joke, too, tuna tuna.

Quadruplets.

Left-handed people.

People with that David Bowie different color dye thing.

Christian rock songs that actually rock.

Gay racists, fat vegans, and tan goths.

Wow.

Holy cow.

And let me point out, this is selective cannibalism.

I do not...

It's non-lethal cannibalism.

But you are eating human flesh?

Pieces of human flesh, yes.

Wow.

Just like the royal family is reported to do, if you follow some conspiracy.

But this is what you do.

And you do.

That's a lot to get more.

Only the true ones.

Yeah, that's how much are these old portions?

Are these like cubed out?

Like how much of these things?

Are these on like toothpicks on a platter?

What's the deal?

Actually, it's just like toothpicks at a cocktail party.

Yeah.

On a platter, yeah.

Like how they used to present like a Swedish meatball.

It's not on a platter.

It's on a flat silver disc.

That's what we call a platter, actually.

A reflective silver.

It's a reflective silver.

Sure.

Like a tray.

Well, sort of, but it's round.

A platter, I think.

Trays are rectangles.

Have you never seen a platter before?

You've been a tray parker?

Yeah.

Tray Parker as well?

In a way.

Human beings are rectangles.

What I do is every morning I have a bunch of old mops with wigs on that I pretend are people at a cocktail party.

Of course.

Then we have these platters, as you call them.

Okay, see, I think they are platters now.

No, they're trays.

What did I say?

Yeah.

And then I consume this in my breakfast.

Do you cook all of these things?

No.

These are meant to be eaten raw.

They're meant to be cooked.

Oh, but you eat them raw.

That's right.

I'm out of Bunsen burner.

Stir now.

Yeah.

I'm out of...

Bunsen burner stir now.

One of my favorite sitcoms.

Oh, which one?

I'm not remembering.

Head of the glass.

Oh, oh, yes.

Bunsen burner.

Bunsen burner stir now.

That's perfect stir now, exactly.

That was the original name for Party Down.

Was it perfect stir now?

Yeah.

That was produced by Jonathan Sterno, I think.

Well, this...

Bob, I'm glad you're back on a great diet and...

And...

Mediation...

You do not look healthy.

You look...

You look like Salah.

Feel my cheek.

It's my heartbeat.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Your heart's all the way up here.

Your cheek.

Yeah.

You look un...

I don't want to listen.

It's been a while since I've seen you, Bob.

I don't want to speak out of term, but I don't think this diet is working.

Yeah.

You seem very unhealthy.

No, no.

These are just the toxins leaving my body.

Yeah.

I actually think Bob looks great.

Think in that he looks like the color of a green grape.

Yeah.

Right.

Yeah.

It's like a...

Thank you.

Salah and John Deus.

That's what you see.

Human.

You're coloring his kind of taken on the qualities of camouflage.

And your kinterine in gray.

Your skin is dry.

I hide from the poachers.

I hide in hay fields quite a bit.

Okay.

So the jaundice helps in the dry dry.

Right.

And the dry dry dry.

And the dry dryness seems to make you be curling inward a little bit.

Yeah.

They kind of like opposite of scoliosis.

Right.

And the dry dryness is flattened for back.

Yeah.

And front D.

And you're flattening for the front.

These are very simple things to understand.

Of course.

But I will say your skull is looking bigger.

Yes.

Thank you.

I mean, it's most of my skull is fontanelle.

Because you do have scoliosis, right?

Yeah.

Which gives you a head this size of scoliosis.

And you also have scoliosis.

What are the exfilases?

Because you've been watching the exfilases a lot.

Yes, they do.

Oh, oh, I thought you...

No, I have scoliosis.

Because I can't fly a plane.

Oh, right.

Yeah.

That's so...

That's so unburger.

And some might say he flew it very well and saved hundreds of lives.

Yeah, it's almost...

Sure.

And got a big head as a result.

Yeah.

Scoliosis.

You know who wouldn't say that?

Oh, birds.

Oh, yeah.

I mean, yeah.

He's been on the show many times and does not like birds.

Your skull is poking out of your skin in places.

It's almost as if you have horns.

Yeah.

You didn't know about that.

Have you made any deals lately?

Deals?

What a strange thing to ask Jason.

Have you made any deals?

That's funny you should ask.

It's always been my dream to play blues guitar.

Okay.

I'll win.

And recently, well...

You were in the Mississippi Delta?

I was near New Orleans.

At the crossroads?

It did happen...

No, it wasn't a crossroads.

It's just a place where four roads come together.

Oh, no, that's a crossroads.

No, that's a crossroads.

Oh, I have a terrible news that is a crossroads.

No, no.

As long as you didn't meet anybody at the crossroads, we're fine.

Like, so fine.

You did?

Oh, no.

Oh, boy.

Did that person offer you any kind of deal?

Well, he was a very friendly person and I told him that my life hadn't worked out the way I wanted, that I always dreamed of playing blues guitar and Mississippi Delta.

And he said, how much do you want it?

I said, so, so, so, so bad.

And he did promise that in exchange for my soul, I could have this wish.

So, do you understand what that means to be, to treat your soul?

What it means is that I have a friend.

Oh, Bob, that's a...

Yeah.

Name Bill.

Okay.

Bill's a Bob.

Yeah.

Bill's a Bob?

Bill's a Bob was his name.

Uh-huh.

I think he must work at a Bill to Bear workshop or something like that.

I'm not exactly sure.

Why do you think that?

Because the name sounds similar.

Oh, you think...

So Bill sounds very close to Bill?

And you think as a result, that must be where he works.

Because people only work.

It's just damage, ejection.

People only work.

I just applied Oscar's razor to it.

Okay.

Oh, no.

I think you mean, uh, it doesn't matter.

So, are you able to play guitar now?

Uh, well, I don't have a guitar here, but I have been working on the singing.

Yeah, let me see the fingering.

Shrish, bersh, in a depot, beth.

Oh, no.

Spare splash in the big old bathroom.

Number four.

Yes, sir.

That's my baby.

No, sir.

Don't say maybe.

Uh, so funny.

So funny.

Such a staple of the early years and now, uh, infrequently, and we have newer people coming on, but always great to hear from Seth.

And he was doing his own Bob Dooka podcast.

Yeah, Bob Dooka.

Yeah, so people are interested in that.

I think all of those are probably...

They're still up, I believe.

Up on howl are Stitch Premium.

Uh, really funny.

Uh, some of them short episodes and then he would hit you with a like a 35 minute one where he's just falling for 35 minutes.

Uh, really funny.

Okay, let's take a break when we come back.

We'll have the top three.

And if Paul's not in any of these, he is going to be upset.

So that's going to be fun to watch.

Um, come on back.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang, we're back here.

Paul F. Tompkins, count them down.

We're in the top four episodes.

These are the ones that people like the best.

It's crazy to think about, right?

That we could do a thing that people would like and then we rank them.

Okay.

I guess.

This is the ninth time we've done it.

I'm not sure why it's just occurring to you now.

Okay, so, uh, like I was talking about, I can't remember it was this episode or the previous one.

The top four episodes were always the number four.

Oh, from the, from the very first votes to the very last votes.

These were the ones that were the majority of people voted for.

Um, I can go into the stats more towards the end of the episode, but, um, we're getting into your top three.

This is very exciting.

This is your episode number three.

Number three.

All right.

Paul, so few episodes left.

I know.

We'll see if you're in any of these.

And you know what happens if I'm not.

Is that a threat or is it a promise?

It's something that's going to happen.

It's a vision of the future.

Okay.

Got it.

But in, is this a future of what will be or what may be spirit?

Oh, this is going to happen.

All right.

This is chicken make lousy health pet.

I did not know that.

Yeah.

This is your episode number three.

This is from December 12th of 2016.

Oh my God.

Now we've talked about the eligibility period is Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving.

This is the earliest episode to make the countdown.

Wow.

This is the 2016 holiday spectacular.

Now those are fun always.

These are fun always.

We always have a good time.

We have a good time.

Wait a minute.

That's right.

You're in this, Paul.

You're in another episode.

That is great to hear.

You're in seven of the top 16.

That's very exciting.

That's seven out of your eleven.

That's very exciting.

Let me run.

I was writing down the names of the people who were on this episode and I quite honestly I had forgotten how many people were on this episode.

There are a lot of people.

This is maybe the most people who have ever been on a comedy band.

Let me see if I can remember who they played.

Okay.

Jason Manzukas.

Himself.

Rhea Butcher.

Herself.

John Gabers.

He's followed it softball so far.

If I remember correctly he did genome.

My campered?

Oh.

The hay salesman?

John.

Did he do the azale?

No, he did John Lennon.

He did John Lennon.

Yeah.

What did you do?

Let's get back to me.

Okay, we'll get back to you.

Neil Campbell.

Oh wait.

I was at Allie Peterson this is.

You were.

Allie Peterson aka the smooth criminal.

Neil Campbell.

Neil Campbell was the timekeeper.

Maxwell Keeper, the timekeeper.

Yes.

Tawny Newsom and Tim Bolts.

They were the Orbansky brothers.

Yes.

Gary and Ron Orbansky.

Neil Hines.

Will Hines was Frosty the Snowman?

Yes, you do remember.

Ryan Gull.

Ryan Gull is Norm Hamer.

Norm Hamer of course.

Of course.

Drew Tarver.

Keith.

Yes.

Keith Jones.

Jeremy Rowley.

Ming.

Zeke Nicholson.

Bonequiff.

No.

Dr. Green.

Oh fuck.

Dr. Green.

James Adomian.

Oh, who was he on the Christmas show?

Was he Jesse Ventura?

He was Jesse Ventura.

Yes.

And rounding it out we have Brendan Small.

Oh.

Was he Victor and Tiny?

Victor Tiny and Willie.

And Willie.

Oh three of them.

That is the most stacked episode I believe in somebody band being ever.

When we put it out I remember people saying like this has to be in the countdown at the end of the year.

Normally we've talked about it in the early episodes people forget about but this one has always been number three has always been up there.

The top three are very close but there were a few hundred I believe votes in between them.

And so this has always been number three.

These are always fun.

These are very chaotic episodes.

They're very difficult for a person such as I to steer because everyone has great jokes and wants to talk at the same time.

But they're always very fun to do and I don't know exactly what clip we're going to listen to from it.

I believe it may be a selection of different people talking but let's hear a little bit of it.

This is your episode number three the 2016 holiday spectacular.

Number three.

You know what we should do is we should go Christmas caroling together.

That would be great.

You know walk around a neighborhood you know just like seeing the.

Oh wait who's this hello who was that?

Count me in very handsome.

Sorry.

Didn't mean to interrupt.

Wait hello sir can you step into the light I can't quite tell who you are from the shadows.

Oh he's got a headset mic on stranger.

This is the Howard Jones aka Michael Jackson no no Janet Jackson aka Justin Bieber depending on what generation you are you skip pretty spares.

Sorry Britney Spears depending on how old you are link between Janet Jackson and Justin Bieber.

Who are you sir I still can't tell who you are.

It's got we've met many times before sure but I can't see you and I can't tell by your voice and you're wearing big sunglasses and a floppy brimmed hat forgive me it's me.

Allie Peterson the smooth.

Allie Peterson have you guys met?

I have not been.

This is Jason man Zukas you may know pleasure the league and the dictator.

Please don't be I'm going to remove my big floppy head sunglasses.

Please don't be alarmed by my appearance.

It's almost like you were faking your death with that hat.

Well wouldn't be the first time.

Sure I know that.

As you can see I am completely hairless.

Whoa.

Wow.

You don't need to show us everything.

Get the alien on French.

Put some of that back.

A fashion icon for me personally.

This is of course intern Geno over here.

Geno Lombardo.

I've never met.

I've seen the song I've seen the lean but I've never seen.

Do you do the lean from the video as well?

What video?

Michael Jackson video you know Michael Jackson Janet's brother.

Jackson is or what?

He had a song called smooth criminal.

Did he really?

He did alien and farm famously covered it.

It wasn't the other way around.

Hey that's like Michael Jackson song.

I genuinely feel like that's another band you are like going to try and convince me it's good.

Nope.

I like that one song.

Maybe movies.

See.

All right.

Well I'm called the smooth criminal of course because I'm completely hairless and I'm wanted by the law.

Oh okay.

So you've never heard the song before.

I've never heard the song but it sounds like it's right up my alley.

What about dirty Diana?

You ever hear that?

I love it.

Okay it's the same album I believe.

Oh I guess I didn't listen all the way through.

Well you turned it off.

I skipped around.

Okay shuffle.

Shuffle will fuck you that way.

You miss a big single that way.

But speaking what I would do was I had it on vinyl and I would just do a random meal drop just see where the album took.

In the middle of songs or after when songs were finished.

I have an uncanny ability to get it right on the track.

Wow.

Speaking of right on the track this is John Lennon, L.A.

Peterson.

Hello.

Like the singer John Lennon?

Oh wow I was a guitar player.

In the who sang?

Wait a minute.

From the European rock band The Beatles.

That's right.

Well you probably heard some of my work.

Now hold on a second.

I feel like you're working my side of the street.

Did you fake your own death soon?

Oh no no we went over this just a moment ago.

I was dead.

No need to catch me up.

But just in case somebody has...

I'll just...

Just in case a listener has just dropped the needle at this point in the podcast we will repeat John Lennon's history.

We should do that throughout the show.

Everyone repeat what they was just doing.

Anytime someone new comes in let's back up.

Let's get back up to the beginning.

Just for those who...

Even if they have vital information they're trying to get out let's make sure that we catch everyone.

Yeah and let's scream at them.

So you know all it wants.

And this is for our listeners who are listening to the podcast on vinyl.

But you know I do have to say this begs the question some may say even raises the question.

Some should say that.

I think we should probably just use braces.

Braises yes.

Finally.

This red wine braises the question.

It's like grunge and broasting.

This bros the question.

Do people think that you faked your death?

We've never talked about that.

I'm certainly thinking that.

I mostly you know some people ask me that and I'll say how dare you.

Okay.

Do you think I would trick the American public or the European public?

And you know I'll say fuck you to that person.

What?

Just like Selo?

I'll shove them.

I'll shove them onto the ground and I'll walk away.

What about the African public?

The two.

Asian public.

Australian.

Yeah I think they're a little behind a little bit.

It's right.

The world public.

Well.

Could have saved yourself some time.

No I would never fake my death.

You would never do it.

But why did you fake yours?

To get out of a long term relationship.

Oh smart.

Yes.

Interesting.

Yeah who was this or was her name dirty Diana?

I can't remember.

Remember what?

Remember what's not dirty Diana.

Were you.

That's your case.

For a moment were you under the impression her name was dirty Diana.

I thought it might be.

I hoped it might be in order to really have cohesion.

Her name of course was Carla Firth.

Oh Carla Firth.

That's right.

Clumsy poor man too.

Her father and mother's names.

I remember.

This is my favorite part of the story.

You told her father that.

I told her to his face.

You respect him before it.

You didn't have a few drinks.

I found those.

Well no.

Her mother had several drinks.

Her mother Jennifer is a terrible drug.

Terrible.

So you were stone cold sober?

Yes, true drug for Ruth.

I was stone cold sober.

For Ruth is a bad, bad hangover.

It takes a lot.

It's a terrible hangover.

Yeah.

So now you, you were stone cold sober and her father.

How do you describe her father?

Well he was a sniveling worm.

He was a spinvling worm.

He was a spinvling weakling.

I have told this story literally every time we met.

And I love it.

I was a dinner at my girlfriend's parents house.

And was she that too?

Yes she was there too.

So was the father?

Yes she had invited me.

And when is this?

This was deep into the relationship.

Okay.

As I recall.

We've been dating since college and we've been together for quite some time.

And this was, yes probably not long before I decided to fake my own death to get out of the relationship.

I got pulled feet.

And we were at dinner at her parents house.

Her mother Jennifer in the kitchen pretending to work on roast but secretly drinking her third bottle of remoten.

Carla Fower was upstairs in the bedroom making herself presentable for dinner.

So it was because it takes a while because third bottle of remothe.

No that depends on her.

It depends how quickly you drink.

That's true.

I mean she may have started quite late into the, if she takes a while to get ready that could be why you thought her name was Dirty Diana because she's got to clean it all off.

That's true.

That's a good point.

All that jazz could have been right.

And the song was Dirty Diana literally covered in dirt.

I believe right.

She had like bugs buzzing around there like a Peanuts cartoon.

This is a real thing.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Like a Peanuts cartoon.

You think that the actual cartoons have flies buzzing around them?

Yeah you know when you watch TV and then that one character comes out and the flies are attractive to it.

Sure.

Sure but I thought you meant when you open the Sunday paper that flies came out and we're buzzing around the actual cartoon.

Do you think the Peanuts cartoon is giving off flies?

Some sort of stench or something.

I do only read the newspaper from the bottom of my dad's bird cage.

So that could be the reason why this flies there is also bird shit on Flosside.

Which works.

It works.

It works for most of the cartoons.

Most of the cartoons.

These are all, I mean who has modern newspapers?

It's all iPads now.

That's true.

You get an iPad on the front step every holding.

So Carla Fur was getting ready and what happened?

I was in the living room with her father Carl.

Mm-hmm.

And I asked him the origin of Carla Fur's name and he showed me and I was shaking his head.

Right.

I looked up straight in the eye and I said I find that to be a clumsy boy bad toe.

And he thanked me.

He thanked you.

Wow.

And what's odd to me was this is pretty deep into the relationship as I recall in our previous conversation and this is the first time you ever thought to ask about the origins of her name.

I'd ask Carla Fur of course but I wanted to hear from her since it's you.

Greetings.

What?

Who's this guy?

Tick tock.

Oh my.

Tick tock.

Who's this?

Who's the standard fellow in the midnight blue star field cloak?

If I know that voice anywhere and obviously I do right here.

Yes, yes.

Tis I the very time keeper.

Maxwell keeper.

Yes.

Why are you crying?

Because I'm feeling misery.

Okay.

Why are you feeling?

More misery than Paul Sheldon.

Why are you feeling such misery?

Because everyone has been saying they can't wait for 2016 to be over.

Oh.

This is the worst year that everyone's blaming everything on the year.

Well sure.

I mean David Bowie died.

David Bowie died.

The guy who invented General Soze Chicken.

Some would say democracy.

Oh boy.

Yes.

I've heard such an phrase.

Maxwell aren't you excited though for 2017?

I say no.

At the brand new 365 days.

No.

Okay.

You've said it three times already.

I get the picture.

Nay.

Okay.

Nay.

I say as punishment for everyone blaming the year we do 2016 over again.

Oh.

Next year we call it 2016.

Well but we can't bring David Bowie back to life.

We can't bring Prince back to life.

No.

We had it.

Oh why are you crying the most about Fino Castro?

I miss him.

Wait are you from Cuba?

No.

But I'm from Florida.

Florida.

Yeah.

Northern Cuba as they call it.

We love our little bay of pigs across the lake.

The lake.

The Atlantic lake.

Well I'm a time guy not a geology guy.

So Maxwell how do you think this is going to work?

I mean we just call it 2016 and then the same events happen.

And then if we go okay we show some appreciation for the year.

Then at the end we go we deserve a new year now.

We didn't spend all year blaming the year for things that weren't the years fall.

Would different things happen though?

This is what I'm confused about.

Yes.

It would just be 2016.

We're calling it that until we show some proper respect.

If there were certain jobs where that had say term limits of four years or so would that then extend to five under this new because we would be repeating a year?

Or would someone get to keep going throughout a year that where someone was supposed to stop next year?

These are questions for our president elect to decide.

Wait so you think on January 20th?

20th yes.

That's still going to happen and he'll decide what happens.

What are the chances that he'll say you know what?

Let's go back to the previous guy.

Well you know what if he could do 2016 over again and this time he would win the popular vote like he said he could.

Right.

If he wanted to.

Right right right.

So that would happen.

Now my question is do we go then from 2016 right to 2018 like the 13th floor on a elevator.

No wonderful question.

No.

Wow you're the build up to that.

We should still give every year its proper respect and you're only allowed to move on to the next year if you've shown appreciation for said year.

Okay.

What if there are people who showed appreciation with 2016 can they move on?

Yeah can certain people be moving forward any year or do we need consensus?

Democracy rules.

Mm-hmm.

Is this a grassroots effort to get this going or is this?

Yes yes it's very grassroots.

Meaning just you.

It's just me.

But I'm using the power of the airwaves to broadcast a podcast in my message.

Okay so starting here I guess.

Starting here.

This is a fancy way of you saying that you're on the show right now.

Yes.

Okay.

Great.

Well Maxwell good luck to you.

I don't know if this is going to gain any practice.

Can I ask a question of the time keeper?

Sure.

Can you access the past?

Like can you go back?

Are you a time traveler?

Yeah I don't know.

I don't know.

This has been a stab.

That's what I'm wondering.

Do you have any time powers?

I feel as if this has been a stab.

Yeah.

Has it?

That you just like time a lot.

Yeah.

I access it through my memories.

Okay.

Just making sure.

Just making.

Time travel of a sort.

Every morning I flip through a photo album.

Sure.

Recalling past occasions.

Every morning you do.

Every morning.

Which is a wonderful time.

Of course.

Not that times you don't like.

Yes.

What are the times you don't like?

I've never heard you say you don't like it.

Yeah.

What's an unlikable time for you?

420.

Oh.

Hey.

Why do you?

I'm straight edge.

Oh.

Hi.

How are you?

It's nice to see you.

Norm.

Norm Hamer from Hamer Nissan.

No.

Carl's bad.

Not a, wasn't planning on being here today.

We are actually doing the, the Hamer Nissan Holiday Naughty and Nice Nissan Sentra Car Giveaway Contest.

Oh, okay.

This is one of our, you're one of our sponsors or something?

Is that what?

Not yet.

We can talk about that though.

I'd love to, I'd love to get something hooked up.

What is this?

I'll say this.

When I'm running this show, this kind of shit's not going to happen.

Who let you in here?

A, a, a Daryl?

I don't know.

Daryl, there's no one named Daryl.

Well, there was a guy named Daryl and he let us in.

He said, do what you want.

Us.

He let us in?

Who else are you with?

Well, I'm with the two finalists.

Thanks for asking and thanks for bringing it up.

These are the two finalists.

We have Ming, Ming, go ahead and introduce yourself.

Hi, my name is Ming.

Oh, hey Ming.

That's, yeah.

That's who I thought I knew.

Yeah.

I wouldn't know me.

I'm trying to win the car.

I would love to win.

And you wanted to be a sports person for a while?

I did at a four minute, yeah.

Yeah.

Hot minute.

And now I want to win this car.

I don't want to be scrub anymore, you know, driving around.

Sure.

Scrub is a...

What is, what is a scrub?

Won't get no love for me.

Oh, yeah.

They're hanging out the passenger side.

Yeah.

Best of a Swiss friend is right.

A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fine.

Oh, okay.

Hey, who is he also known as a bus driver?

Yeah, he's also known as a bus driver.

Yeah, I want to be a bus driver.

Who are you?

Who is that talking with the very southern drone?

Hey, my name's Keith Jones.

This is going to be my sixth car this year if I can bring it home.

I am proficient.

I professionally put my hands on hard bodies and...

Ha!

And this is going to be one more.

Unfortunately, this contest is going on longer than I thought it was going on.

And I don't know if you say why Ming is even here.

He's not even from Carl's bad.

He's from Sherman House.

Well, there's no law that you have to buy the car away.

There should be, and I'm trying to lobby for that.

Now, this car contest has been going on since 2010.

We've tied previously every time.

You mean you've been holding the contest annually since 2010?

Biangulently.

Twice a year?

Or every two of you?

Twice.

Semi-annually would be every half here.

Right.

Are you just saying you're bi and semi?

Are you just saying that you're bisexual?

Yeah, I'm saying I'm an abject.

Man and women.

So you're saying you're bisexual and you want to get that out there?

We do it once again, but I'm bisexual.

That makes sense.

There are two of us.

Bicentra.

No, she's right.

Car is a centra.

Needle.

It's a giveaway of the centra.

Reach.

But every year we have tried a different contest.

We started with drawing.

But we had to draw the car.

They had to draw the car.

Oh, so not a drawing?

No, but like a drawing of a car.

In 2010 they each draw.

They had to draw a centra.

Who would judge?

I judge all the contest based on how much it looks like it or best to be fair.

And honestly they both did a wonderful job.

I did a sketch very similar to police artist's type of sketch.

But of a car.

And I did watercolors.

I painted it in watercolors.

Is this from memory?

Yes, we were able to get 15 seconds.

We get to run around the car for 15 seconds and look at it.

And then we get putting a room, which was the contest the following year they had to run around the car.

The car, the...

We got very excited to see it as run around the car.

So you made that the next contest.

Yes.

But every time we time, we try.

It's only the two of you doing these contests?

Yes, since 2010 we've been both tied to settle this.

No other entrance.

2009 centra that we are trying to buy.

It still has not been driven though.

It has 12 miles on it.

It's a beautiful car.

He swears he's not rolling back the mileage, but this car has been in an accident I can tell.

It doesn't need a little...

It's a fix-up a little bit.

But honestly the point is it's a beautiful contest and somebody's going to go home.

Oh, hey Norm, just super quick.

So the first year we've heard was just a drawing.

The second year was a running around the car.

And that catches up in the intervening years.

What was the contest?

2012 was a devil-dag eating contest.

But we both passed out.

And then he...

Right after eating 71 eggs.

71...

71 and out.

71 to devil-dag.

He pumped our unconscious bodies, had the stomachs, and they found a 71 egg each.

No one was keeping track as they eat them.

No, we've had dark eggs.

We've had a cup because he's adjusted as a part.

It was still whole.

There was no chewing though.

I'll take the fall.

I'll take the fall on that.

This is a bad plan.

You've got to count them as they go in and about.

Tell me, we're five years later and this is unsettled.

It was a bad plan.

2000.

You know, after...

After everything there's been in the news recently about protests, it's nice to hear about a contest.

Yes, thank you.

Thank you, Maxwell.

Can I quickly read the disclosure before we go ahead with the contest?

Okay, go ahead.

And again, it's a naughtier, nice story contest.

They'll tell the bestie that you've ever seen.

You said it again?

I don't think that you ever said this.

I said this separately.

You've been feeling a lot of questions.

I've never heard a story.

Here's the thing.

I want to see one of these guys win in the Easton Center.

I just need to know from 2013 to hear how the big fans compete.

I think it's 2011 also.

So I'd like to know...

We took a year off.

I'd also like to know why the first contest was 2010.

They were competing for a 2000.

It was another model.

We tried to get rid of the year, give away.

We were trying to clear some states.

Which is funny because it's technically a 2008.

This contest has really reinvigorated.

Look, we don't have time to go into every contest, unfortunately.

2013 was a hands on a hard body.

We put our hands on a body builder body.

My cousin Larry is an amateur body builder.

Amateur.

He's a bad kid.

You do horrible shit.

Is he just a fat guy?

Yeah, it shouldn't have been called a hands on a hard body.

One to eat hands on a high.

We tied.

We tied it.

Yeah, after Shandy.

Did it erupt into a tickle fight?

I have a question.

Frosty the Snowman here.

Could I have participated in the hard body contest?

If I just had sticks for arms, if I'd put in sticks on the hard body, could I have been a participant?

I had sticks for arms.

Sure, I don't have any problem with that.

I'm in on this next year.

Well, I've always wanted a centra.

You'll be in.

But until we settle this one, we're not looking forward to a new contest.

That's why I just holed frosty.

By the time this car is giving away, it's still street legal.

Because sometimes the laws are updated and it might not have the proper bets.

That is true.

Unfortunately, we can't be responsible for that.

Yeah.

So what is the contest this year?

Naughty or nice, and they're going to tell their bestie to be here.

Now this is the first we're hearing this.

And they're out there.

K-N-O-T-Y.

And I've said it.

Also, it's a rope contest.

Yeah, so do we have to tie a knot and then tell a nice story?

Is that it?

We'll go ahead and first.

Now we forget to set the password for my car.

A good deed from both.

And starting now, the timer starts right now.

My good deed for the contest is one of this last Mar-in-Lufa King day.

I walk, walking down the street.

It's free parking.

You don't have to pay the meter.

And I see this Jewish lady.

She's a hussiness Jewish.

And I saw she was going to put a quarter in the meter and say, Hey, you don't have to do this.

It's Mar-in-Lufa King day.

And she stopped.

She saved the quarter.

She did not talk to me because she's not allowed to talk to the man.

It's not her husband.

But I saw in her eyes the thanks.

And time.

That's my time on your good deed.

And we'll jump right into the good deed from Keith.

Alright, let's say I guess.

Too bad Maxwell, you didn't get to use the time of this one.

You know, I was just trying to let him get to it.

I'm going to go ahead, Keith.

The nicest thing I ever done was I raised $15 million for the victims of 9-11.

The clear winner.

I know that you would see no over the contest.

But we had so much money.

You could have built a Westworld for snowman.

You could have watched the show on the Sancentris.

It depends on the naughty.

I'm really curious about these naughty.

There's a naughty?

Okay, we have to do naughty.

Also, don't act like this is settled because I have a real woman that I'm looking in her eyes.

He helped what, ghosts?

I was going to say the victims of 9-11.

He didn't give it to the family of the victims.

He's very specifically said the victims of 9-11.

They don't need anything.

Yeah, that's true.

You just, I buried $15 million.

Thanks.

Crown Zero.

Wait, is it still there?

Oh, shit, this is going to be a race.

This is like, Nick Cage is going to beat us all.

Number three.

Oh, mama.

We did it.

Here's what I love about those long shows, the holiday shows, is that by the end, it's, there's so much laughing, there's so much laughing, and it gets really, really silly.

And everybody's really punchy, and it's whoever the last handful of people are, that's always what the most fun ends up being for me, from having been here for however many hours it's been.

And especially when it's, you know, like Ryan and Drew and Jeremy, and they come in and they're just ridiculous.

They're just idiots.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And a lot of people maybe wonder how these shows are put together.

Especially at the end of the year, it's kind of like, this is for the fans, most years, here's how this particular one came together and why there are so many people on.

Most years, and with most episodes, I have to put out a lot of emails to get people to come, right?

So it's a very difficult show to book, especially around people's schedules.

So this particular time, I was like, and what these episodes at the end of the year are designed to do are to be like, have all of our favorite people on that can make it and doing their favorite characters.

And it's just a gift to the fans that we try to give.

So this one, I was like, okay, I'm going to put it out to all the people.

And like every year, 50 to 60% will not be able to do it.

Every single person, I think, could do it.

I believe maybe I got like three people saying they couldn't do it out of the 25 or whatever.

And then it was like, oh, and you can't disinvite people.

You can't disinvite people.

So except for schoolmen.

Brits.

I said, it's going to be like this, get the fuck out with your 20 mil.

So with these, the challenge becomes, okay, how do you stack them?

When do you invite people to come in?

They can't be a mil.

This particular one, I believe, was two hours and 45 minutes long or something like that.

And what we typically would do, and this is how we have done it every year, is we schedule someone in maybe 15 minute increments and then say, and you can leave after your thing, you know, we don't want to take up everyone's day.

And somehow this particular year that we just heard and the one that we just had a week ago or two weeks ago, everyone wanted to stay the entire time.

And in fact asked, can I come at the beginning and stay the whole time?

A lot of times we'll try to stagger it out.

So it's like introduce new people.

And everyone's like, can I just come at the beginning and just stay the whole time?

Which is wonderful.

Yeah.

And just leads to them being insane.

Yeah.

I don't mean the performers.

I mean the episodes themselves.

Exactly.

But a little bit of both.

Oh, speaking of a little bit of both, let's take both commercials and a break at the same time.

Good segue.

Let's take commercials.

We are going to come back with the top two.

This is incredible.

Now, let me just say this.

Paul, if I'm not in.

You've been in seven.

I'm not in one of these top two episodes.

If you're in one, will you be satisfied?

Hold on.

Scott, let me finish my sentence.

Okay.

If I'm one of these top two episodes, I'll be very angry.

Okay.

So if you're in just one of them, you're going to be okay.

You heard what I said.

All right.

I heard what I said.

You can do.

You've been in seven of the top 16 already.

I know.

All right.

When we come back, this is exciting.

We're going to get to maybe the answer to this question.

One of these will be right back with more comedy, bang, bang, after this.

Comedy bang bang.

It is the fourth of January.

Yeah, right.

What do you got planned in January?

Got anything going on?

Well, I'll be in Sketchfest.

That's for sure.

That's right.

We do want to make sure that people go see there's, you have several shows, but there's a tribute to you.

Is that correct?

Yes, that's correct.

On the, is it the 13th?

Come on.

I believe it is on the 13th.

Yes.

And what is the venue?

The venue is Marines Memorial Theater.

Oh, yes, I've been there.

We'll be there Friday night to do Spontaneous Nation Live.

Then I'll be doing, um, uh, Superigo Forgotten Classics.

We'll be doing that live at the Braava Center.

Daddy.

Then later at the Braava Center, we'll be doing Work Juice Improv Live.

You took me horny.

Then on Sunday, I'll be doing, I'll be participating in the Stinker Let's Loose Live Reading.

Oh, that's right.

That's a really funny book.

Yes.

It was written by whom, uh, someone wrote it.

He sends me all of his books.

Oh, what's his name?

Anyway, book center.

Ian book center.

That's right.

Um, and, uh, tickets available.

Apollo time gives Jack Comps slash live for all the links.

Ooh, mama.

Okay.

So that's coming up.

Point.

Flat hand.

Fist.

What did he just said that?

And there was no promo for anything, not about the weather.

Nothing.

I'm going to jump on him.

Da da da da da.

Point.

Flat hand.

Fist.

Dallas range, if you're listening, and I'm, I'm definitely- Please, Dallas.

You can be a Twitter snitch about this.

Yes.

And this to him.

If you're listening, just do that one time.

Please, Dallas.

One time.

Please.

Who cares?

No, it would be that mad at you.

No, they would do it.

They would love it.

They would go viral.

There would go viral is just you saying point flathead fist.

It would be amazing.

Also, come on the show.

Come on the show and we'll, and we'll have you do it on the show.

And we'll dish about what you think about Fritz.

Fuck it.

Doosh bag.

Oh my god.

$20 million.

Really raise your bet.

All right.

Let's get to it.

Let's, this is, this is exciting.

Our top two episodes.

Let's get to your number two.

Number two.

All right.

Number two.

Can't wait to hear who's in it because, as I said before, if I'm not in these top two episodes, I'll be very angry.

Okay.

One of the top two episodes you said.

I said if I'm not in any of these top two episodes.

You said you, you want to be in at least once.

Got it?

Hear me now.

If I smell me later.

I'm not in any of these top two episodes.

I'm going to be very angry.

Okay.

All right.

Well, this is the episode that people chose as their number two.

And this comes to us.

This is episode 485 and it comes to us on May 1st.

Does that ring any bells for you?

Oh, communism.

What does May 1st be?

Mayday.

Mayday, of course.

Yes, of course.

By the way, I went to a Christmas party recently.

Congrats.

Thank you.

Okay.

So let's move on to- Oh, there's more to the story.

Now, my wife and I, we were told most of the party is going to be taking place outside.

So be sure to wear a coat.

Okay.

So if you wear that coat that I wanted to see.

Shmoop.

That coat that I got her last year for last Christmas.

And then- I gave you a coat and George Michael died the very same day.

And then I have a coat that is a sort of complimentary coat, military looking- Did you own this coat, previous to the coat?

Did you buy her coat as a compliment or did you luck into this?

I lucked into this coat after having bought her that coat.

That is an amazing serendipitous occasion.

And so I had that coat and I was wearing a vest and a tie, festive holiday season.

And I wore a cap, like a sort of- New and military nautical cap.

New and military nautical.

Yes.

Okay.

And so, and I had glasses on.

These glasses, these rimless glasses as you see.

And so when we were leaving the party, we called a lift.

And as we were getting to our car, there was another Uber lift guy leaning against a car and he looked at me and he had this rye smile on his face.

And he said, you know who you look like?

And I said, no.

And he goes, you know, Lennon?

John Lennon?

No.

He meant- It was Vladimir Iliovich Lennon.

Wow.

Yeah.

He thought you looked like Lennon.

Yeah.

And then I saw a picture of us and I was like, I get what he's talking about.

Interesting.

And did Janie look like Lennon's- No, she looked adorable.

She's my princess wifey.

I love her.

Why wasn't I invited to this party?

Ooh.

I don't want to tell you now.

So May 1st.

May 1st does not ring any bells to you, but long time, first times of comedy bang bang will know that the very first- May 1st actually, I believe, was the very first episode of comedy bang bang ever.

Is that so?

Back eight and one half years ago.

So is this an anniversary?

This is the eighth anniversary show.

The one of us there.

Mmm.

And this is another one of these giant gang episodes where a million people are on.

A bunch of people.

And wait a minute, Paul, hold on a second.

Are you telling me?

Paul, I believe you're on this episode.

Oh shit.

Your anger is stated you will no longer be angry anymore.

Well, we'll see.

What do you mean?

Was that what we'll see?

No.

We did see that though.

We did see that.

Where are you still saying you're going to be angry if you're not in the top one?

Let's just talk about this right now.

Okay.

Let's talk about this one.

Let's let's break down who we have.

Break down.

See if you can get to the end.

Alright, P.

No, right?

I forgot.

Yeah.

Oh, it's good to forget these things.

It is nice to forget when we learned that.

You want to think of the Tom Petty's up there just jingle jangling away, you know, up and down.

Jingle jangle, the drug from Riverdale.

Is that really?

He told me that I found this.

I found this information.

That's like an old.

It's just sort of, let's just say.

There is not only is there a drug called jingle jangle.

God.

But at one point a character says to someone else, I got a room at the five seasons.

The five seasons.

God damn it.

And you know what?

A friend of my works on that show and I'm going to have to take it up with me.

Mr. Weatherby?

Alright.

Give me the names.

Let me see if I can remember who played who.

Alright.

Who's Zuma who?

John Gabers.

Oh, I bet he played Gino.

Alright, Lauren Lapkis.

Lauren Lapkis?

She played two characters.

Strangely enough.

Oh, she played two.

She played Todd.

No.

Oh, I didn't even get one of the two.

Nope.

Regina crimp.

Regina crimp, you are correct.

The other one I don't believe you'll know, peanut.

I forgot about peanut.

That's like Dre.

Peanut was like a friend of Regina crimps.

Maybe.

I'm not sure.

Zeke Nicholson back again.

Playing the character that you thought.

Bonkweef.

Yes.

Karl Tartt.

Chief.

Yes, that's right.

This may be the, I believe this is the origin and we'll hear it of hashtag bone chief.

Mary Holland.

Oh, Mary Holland playing like a little boy.

Chucky split.

Mike Hanford.

John Lennon.

Of course.

Jessica McKenna.

Oh, she played like a little gymnast.

Dagmar the Small.

Yes.

Toni Newsom and Tim Bolts.

They were the airbansky.

They're not strangely enough.

Fudge.

They are characters named Bert and Raro Riley.

I don't remember anything about that.

That was a surprise to me when I read this.

Ryan Goll.

Norm Hamer.

I'm Mark Steve.

And Jeremy Riley.

Nick Crow.

He was the Australian guy.

Arshrift.

Yes.

That's right.

And who were you?

You played two characters.

Are you surprised to learn that?

I am surprised to learn that.

You played, take a wild stab at who these could be.

Oh, no, you played three.

You played three, my friend.

I believe two of them were dedicated to recently departed characters that you played before.

Yes.

You played six.

That's right.

You played those.

And Cake Boss.

Cake Boss.

That is correct.

So talk about your experience on this episode.

We'll hear a little bit of it.

Do we want to talk about before after we hear some clips?

What are you doing?

Let's hear some clips.

Okay, we'll be.

This is your episode number two.

This is the eighth anniversary show.

We plop.

Number two.

Anyway, I just want to take 10 minutes ago.

I don't have anything else off.

I do have super natural powers.

Well, I mean, maybe we could speak with someone.

Well, look, 2016 was a very difficult year for the human race.

Sure.

But last year was terrible not only for all of America, with so many people passing on, but for this show in particular, some of our dear old friends passed away and are no longer on the show anymore.

Maybe we could speak to one of them?

What?

Like who?

Well, I mean, there was someone who passed away, who's been on the show almost as long as you, I would say.

And he was a dear, dear friend to us and showed up in Toronto and you were there in Toronto.

I was there in Toronto.

You were there.

You were there on food cake.

Yeah, you were there a day apart, I believe.

And he was an old old friend and we never got closure on him, but our good friend Gary Marshall.

Hmm.

You want to talk to Gary Marsh?

Sure.

Director of Pretty Woman.

No, I know who he is.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Great or a happy day.

Sure.

All right.

Well, it's been a while.

Let me go into my trench and then see if I can...

A cake trance.

I go into my cake trench.

Sure.

He said trench.

No, trench.

I'm sorry?

A trench.

I go into a trench.

Oh, I got it.

Do you need anything for us to get into this cake trance?

Oh, by trench music?

So, if you could just place just...

Transmuse me.

I mean, we never did it before, but...

I don't think I had my iPod.

I'm sorry.

What about trap house?

All right.

Yeah, we go.

We did the old trench.

I appear across the mystic veil that separates this world from the next.

Oh, spirits attend me.

Can you command spirits?

I can't command, but please don't try not to talk to me what I'm in the trench.

It makes it very difficult.

What?

Did you get Canadian?

Suddenly.

I'm looking for a man named Gary Marshall.

Please call me Gary.

Gary, your back.

Scott, it's me.

Gary Marshall.

That's right.

How you doing, son?

It's so great to see it.

This is Gino.

Hey, Gary.

How are you?

Gino.

Where are you from?

I'm from Long Island.

Oh, all right.

What am I seeing here?

What do you mean?

I'm looking at you're looking at cake boss.

Yes.

Gary Marshall is very much.

Oh, he's still in there.

He's still in there somewhere struggling to get free.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Anyway, why have you disturbed my turn arrest?

Gary, it's so I just, you know, we never got to speak after your untimely death and.

Oh, probably because I was dead.

Well, the true is that do you think that's the reason?

He could be, but this is the thing you say to a lot of people who've died.

Hey, I didn't get a chance to talk to you after you died.

Look, I don't get a chance to talk to a lot of people who have died.

Maybe Chewbacca, but look, I, we miss you down here on Earth.

Oh, that's very nice of you to say.

I guess I missed you too.

Although, of course, looking down from heaven, I could see everybody and what they're doing all the time.

Oh, right.

So you've been watching us the entire time.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Among other people.

Yeah.

I'm naughty.

This guy.

Hey, I'm sorry.

I'm just, I'm alone here in LA for a week.

I'm cutting loose.

I apologize for anything you may see in Mr. Marshall.

Oh, heads up, please.

Hey, please call me Gary.

Gary, right.

You have Gary privileges.

Oh, I like it.

Gary privileges.

Hey, just so you know, uh, Joni died, but unfortunately, Chachi still alive.

Yeah, I know.

I know.

It's too bad.

Sorry about that everybody is still got a little bit of.

Yeah, I got it kind of.

Got it kind of swapping.

No, he's going in there, but not a great order for the.

Happy days crew.

Look, uh, Gilly, by the way, I'm sure misses you.

I don't know if you've been checking in on your.

Sure.

Misses my money.

I'm sure.

Yeah.

Well, she never got to lock that down because you had transported to another dimension.

That's right.

And never returned by the time.

Oh, this is like mid 80s.

X-Men.

Mid 70s.

Mid 90s.

The stalling stuff.

Uh, what's happened?

Like, can you tell us?

Yeah, it's like exactly what you think it is.

It's a bunch of clouds, big golden gate.

Everybody's got a robe and a halo bridge meeting.

Is that because that's the biggest suicide point in America?

That's what they tell me.

They say, look, a lot of people, they're going to be coming here because of suicide.

It's not a sin, by the way.

Now they tell me.

No, wait, we would have committed suicide.

There was some dark times, you know.

Oh, okay.

I don't know.

I remember one time I was hunting the Chupacabra.

Yeah, that's right.

And I thought I'll never find him.

He doesn't exist.

Maybe I should just end my life.

What am I doing?

And then did you catch a glimpse of him?

Yeah, I saw him.

Okay.

So when people jump off the golden gate bridge, they want something that's reassuring.

They turn up right into heaven.

Right.

And they want to see something.

It's a smooth transition.

Right.

Some people go straight down into the water and die and then some people jump off the bridge and get fucking Star Trekked up into it.

They get Star Trekked up into heaven.

That's right.

You're not murderers, are you?

No, no, no, no.

I'm just in the regular heaven.

Regular heaven.

The regular heaven.

It's great.

You hang around all day, you watch people on earth.

You know, you see where you watch them when they sleep in, you see when they're awake.

You know, if they've been bad or good.

Santa, an angel?

What's that?

Santa Claus.

Is he up there?

No, Santa's not.

Because he's a living person.

Oh.

He's in the North Pole.

Okay.

You don't know about Santa.

No, I know too much about Santa.

Seriously?

Oh, right.

He's not a fan.

Yes.

It's because your last name is kind of Jewey.

No, it's because...

Okay.

Moving on.

I mean, admit that's a kind of Jewey last.

All right.

Hey.

Funny that the table's third because you're all the time.

You're like, hey, Gary Watch, are you Jewish?

You're Jewish, right?

Well.

Because I sound like this.

I mean, damn, everything New York is Jew.

Oh, yeah, you're telling me.

This is West Coast.

All right, all right.

You're like, hey, show me your horns.

He's from Orange County.

We know where they...

We know what color they believe.

Come on, guys.

Can I ask you a question?

Do you miss Hector?

Oh, I think about Hector every day.

I try to respect his privacy.

You're so used to having him around.

I know.

Hector Al-El-Zondo, he's my good luck charm, but to a certain point, obviously.

Sure, yeah.

Did you ever think while you were here on Earth, maybe I should lose Hector from these projects.

Maybe he's the Albatross weighing these things down.

Oh, because none of my movies were successful, right?

They're all at us after a certain point.

They're only gigantic hits worldwide.

Well, I don't know about it.

Every holiday.

Mother's Day.

Oh, sorry.

I thought I don't have a perfect track record.

Sorry.

If only you would have lived eight more years.

We could have had Halloween, all but day, Earth Day.

What were you talking about?

Your version of Halloween.

I think we...

Yes, we did.

Does Hector Al-Zondo make an appearance?

You bet you're assy, does.

He doesn't need that mask.

That's right.

It's very good.

What a way less scary, Michael Myers.

Michael Myers is a funny big guy.

Why not have Michael Myers?

He's like a nice guy.

He's like got a paterdoll backwards kangal hat on.

That's Joey Pence.

Oh, okay.

We're thinking of Joe Petheliano.

Yeah.

Aren't you?

Yeah, I think I am, but other people come on.

I think Hector Al-Zondo.

I've seen Al-Zondo have it all.

Yeah, I think Al-Zondo is one.

Any bald actor likes to cover that up.

I've never seen Hector wear a backwards kangal.

Well, you're not around.

Why would he hide this from me?

Check him out.

You can now spy on him 24 hours a day.

I made a deal with Hector.

I said, listen, when I go to heaven, I promise I won't watch you.

Oh, wow.

He has free rein to do any kind of weird shitty stuff.

Do whatever he wants.

Wow.

Well, Gary, it's so good to talk to you.

Please call me, Mr. Marshall.

Oh, so I can later ask you to call me Gary.

All right, Mr. Marshall, it's so good.

Please call me Gary.

Gary, we're back.

It's so great to hear from you.

We miss you.

We want to leave you alone.

Certainly, we want to respect your privacy.

Thank you for once.

But it's so good to hear from you.

If this is the last time you were such a great boon to the show, such a great friend of the show.

By the way, I'm here too.

Is this Alan Thicke?

Yes, it is.

I think we're good.

We have a lot of people on the show.

We're interested.

Robin Thicke's father?

Yes.

Wow.

Sorry about that.

Yeah, okay.

Have you been having a hangout with Alan Thicke?

More than I'd like.

Yeah.

Do they group the people who have recently passed away together?

It's a very specific group.

It's me, Alan Thicke, and Hugh Howeser so far.

Oh boy.

Well, Gary, it's so good to hear from you.

Scott, it's good to hear from you to listen.

The fans love you.

We love you.

I want to say I miss you.

It was so nice to be able to see you one more time.

But now I got a return to heaven and I enjoy my eternal reward, which is, I guess, just being alive forever and looking at people on earth as they take showers.

Watching us jerk off.

Well, yeah.

I mean, you do it.

You know, hey, why not?

You'll see.

I hope.

Be good or be good at it.

That's fun.

We do have to get to our next guest and this is really exciting for us.

They've been on the show.

Well, one of them has been on the show once and the other has been on the show a few times, but it's always nice to see them.

First we have a bonequeat.

What's up motherfuckers?

I'm back.

It's me, your girl, bonequeat.

Bone like a dog and queef like a pussy fart.

Yes, bonequeat.

So nice to see you again.

Yeah, Scott.

How you doing, boys?

Good to see you, baby.

I'm good.

And you, you're here with another guest.

I'm not sure if you're here together or if you're here coincidentally at the time.

We're here together.

This is my sister.

You may have heard before too.

This is your sister.

Please welcome back chief.

Greetings, gumshil.

I've just flown around the world to get here.

All the way from the Ozok Mountains.

You see me drone strikes?

I'm trying to drown the world.

Excuse me?

You see me drone strikes on your right here?

A ton.

Thank you, Obama.

I love you.

So bonequeat and chief, I guess I never realized that you were sisters, but I mean your names rhyme and a lot of people like to do that with their, with naming their children.

Yeah.

We were separated at birth.

My mom was like, this one's going to be called chief and this one's going to be called bone queat.

Bone like the shit that's left when you've done it in revs and queef like a pussy fart.

And wait, your twins?

No.

Okay.

So your mom was, but your mom was not naming you, you were separated at birth, meaning your twins and you were separated.

We're two years.

Yeah.

So you were separated at the younger ones birth?

Yes.

Okay.

And your mom named you at the same time though.

That's right.

Yes.

I'm older, but I did not have a name for two whole years.

She waited.

She was like, I don't know about this one, but when I poop another one out of my front, I'm going to know what this one's name is.

My mother waited just like I waited in the Himalayas for one young Carmen Sandiega.

That's right.

We first heard from you maybe a couple of months ago, but have you tracked on Carmen Sandiega?

I still have yet to track down that buzzling beast, but I will.

I will find her.

And as soon as I find her, I will lock her up in handcuffs in my own personal Acme prison sale.

Lock her up.

Down with Hillary.

Who?

Thanks Obama.

I love it.

With him, whoever, anyone but her.

Yeah, as long as that or her, I'm with him.

This is not what the show is about.

Maybe it should be.

Okay.

I know people thought it would be pushed around.

I guess they're tired of the PODS save America and we need some sort of like.

That's right.

Equal time.

I bless a man.

All right.

So when did you guys find out that you were sisters?

Right over.

We did the 23 Amish shit and it just said this trick is your sister.

Go find it.

So then I took a quick little trip over to the Himalaya Ozarks where I found my girl over here.

I'm looking for this motherfucker coming San Diego.

She ain't been found her but guess what?

I knew where she was.

You know where Kerman San Diego is?

Hell yeah.

That's ridiculous that she won't tell me.

Hey, you won't tell her.

Nah, nah, nah, nah.

But I enjoyed it.

It keeps the magic.

If I find where she is immediately, I won't be able to have a business anymore.

That's right.

My whole business model is surrounded by finding common San Diego.

What about Rockefeller?

Do it.

Do it, Rockefeller.

Did you check from Kiev to Carolina?

Yes.

Okay, that's all I remember.

Because she sneaks around the world from Kiev to Carolina.

If I have a question about your business model, who is paying you to find Carmen San Diego?

Nobody.

The fever in my own heart.

I lust after those milky white breasts.

Yeah, that's one thing that we found out last time you were on this show.

You're somewhat obsessed.

She's trying to fuck Carmen San Diego.

Shut up, queef.

Maybe that's why she's in hiding.

Her name is not queef, it's bone queef.

I told you this bone like I ain't got a jealous bone in my body and queef like a pussy part.

I barely know who you are.

We are sisters.

I've obviously seen Carmen's titties when she keeps that red coat off.

Exactly.

So that's my main mission is to take that red coat off.

Take that red trench coat off.

What if she don't have tits under there?

You ever think about that?

Like what if she just got like transparent or like a turt?

What she has transparent or?

She's like see through all the way to the back.

Y'all know Topshop, you saw them jeans that just got the transparent kneecaps?

Yeah, it's like the so fine jeans.

Right, right, right.

What if Carmen San Diego just says transparent boob region?

You can just see the back.

Can we just see through?

Yeah.

Then she's got two hollow pits where her chest is supposed to be.

And her spine, the T3.

How lucky would that be?

Well then my life work will be null.

So is that the only part of Carmen San Diego bone chief that you're interested in?

Bone chief!

How dare you!

Don't take me away.

That's not so levity couple, man.

Please, man.

Hashtag bone chief, make that difference.

Hashtag bone chief, by the way.

Everyone, it's going to be trending.

Get a bunch of clums.

That's a bad toe.

Wait, you don't like...

It's sort of a perfect part.

You don't like pimentos either when they're clumsy?

You know, I could take a leave.

That's a reference.

Bone queen, what have you been up to?

I mean, obviously you found this out and you tracked Cheat down.

Yeah, yeah.

So I've been looking, yeah, honestly, it's been a bit of a personal journey for me recently.

You know, I have been alone in this world and I was like, I need to find my family, right?

So yeah, I did 23 of me.

I found chief.

I also found out that our last name is Saint Gynecologist.

So...

My name is Saint Gynecologist.

That's right, I am Bonequeep, Saint Gynecologist.

I chose not to take it.

So that's not canonical for you?

No.

Yeah.

So yeah, it's been a pretty big, pretty big couple of weeks for me.

Yeah, real quick, your mom never mentioned that someone was...

Who which one of you is older?

I'm two years old.

So your mom never mentioned that you had a younger sister?

Neither of us grew up with her.

Well, yeah, that's what I was wondering.

She got rid of you too?

She gave me four two years, had another one was like, I do not like the look of them together.

And got rid of them.

It just happened to be on the same day.

That's right.

So would you on your birthday?

On my birthday, August 6, 1951.

She's...

Babe, Bonequeep, you were born in 1949.

Yeah, yeah, black-sized crack motherfucker.

Indeed, it does not.

But I tell you what does crack.

You're 69.

That's right, baby, the best not bad.

She's kind of college-ish.

Yeah, Bonequeep, St.

Gunna College.

It's Bonequeep, like, oh, hold up, I got a bunch of bones.

Bonequeep, St. Stones, might break my...

Queep like a pussy fart.

St. like St. James and Gunna College is like a pussy doctor.

Oh boy.

The Queep is always pussy fart.

No matter how many bone analogy she comes up with.

But also, people are more familiar with bone than Queep.

Like, as a word.

Like to explain, bone is the part I think everyone's supposed to be.

It's the part I think everyone's picking up on.

So are you guys going to get together for Family Reunions now?

Are you looking at the St. Geinna College's family tree?

Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

We're trying to find everybody that's in our family.

And simultaneously look for Thomas San Diego.

So it's a bit of a too pronged...

She might be at the Family Reunions, you know.

I did not want this swammin' to help me find Thomas San Diego.

You are not here yourself.

I have always used preteens.

Because they are the sleuthiest of sleuths.

They're very nosy.

Very nosy.

By the way, you say you're helping, but you know where she is.

Yeah, that's right.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm a 69 year old woman.

I know shit, okay.

I know with that, bitch, it's in a lot of cabin, but I ain't going to tell you where.

I don't want to hear.

I didn't even want this meeting.

I only took the 23andme quiz because one time that comments and the answer.

It's so funny that you can answer ten multiple choice questions and they tell you who your family is.

Just send in the scantron.

How much of it is trivia?

All of it.

Five of the questions.

It's just literal trivia.

Ten multiple choice trivia questions.

And in the end they say you have a sister.

Yep.

Then you swab your DNA.

Oh!

The only reason I did it was because one time comments and Diego spits in my mouth.

Show you a...

Wait, show you...

That sounds kind of...

Commercet and Diego in person in the past.

Not met like hello how do you do?

Just in passing.

What is that guy?

Stop it.

You were passing by each other one day.

She spit into your mouth.

It was on the island of San Tropez.

But what if her spit is actually the one that's assisted with Bonquiv?

Oh.

23 and who?

23 skid, dude.

Wait, how much longer after the spit in your mouth was the quiz that you took?

That was in the 70s.

You know what I mean?

It didn't mean to come out too recently.

Commercet and Diego do got strong DNA.

Maybe that shit was living in there for 35 years.

I try everything.

I can define that comments and Diego.

Whatever you try.

Huh?

You say you've tried everything you can think of.

It's just a classic follow up question, Chief.

What's your name, sir?

Chuckie!

Chuckie Spoiff!

Oh, Chuckie, it's so good to meet you.

Yeah, nice to meet you too.

I thought I knew everyone who wandered the halls here.

Hey, no, no, no.

You never met me before.

No way.

I got a bunch of friends over there.

And then we work all the way.

We all work together.

We take breaks and so I got to go eat the bathroom.

Okay.

Well, it's death.

You gotta go bathroom?

I gotta go bathroom.

I gotta go bathroom real bad.

Chuckie, have you always been a construction worker?

Yeah, yeah.

Pretty much since everything.

I can't remember.

Yeah, we're at time.

You can only remember back to a certain point?

Yeah, I can only.

I didn't really go to...

Well, I don't know.

What's your earliest memory?

Here's the thing.

I woke up.

I was in a hospital room.

Okay.

How long ago was this?

You were born zero.

They were born zero.

They were an adult because I was all hooked up to stuff and I was wearing a gown.

Only a house girl.

Yeah, that's not specific at all.

Hey, you think maybe you didn't wear your hard hat and your construction set and you got hitting the head with a big old bean?

I don't know about...

Hey!

Wait a minute.

Are you saying that because Chuckie has 55 stitches, you know, horseshoe pattern around his home?

Yeah, what's the earliest date you remember?

June 12th, 2017.

Okay, that's a month from now.

That's a month from now.

Oh my God.

Did you...

You were time traveler.

Holy shit, that's dangerous.

Boopy boopy boopy.

I got a name related question for you, Bo.

Oh yeah, both.

It's a Bliff.

It's a Bliff you'll give a name or did you choose ever your say old?

Spliff!

That's a family name.

Do you even remember your name?

Yeah!

Chuckie!

Spliff!

You seem surprised by it every time.

Yeah, you know, I remember everything that's happened.

And it's the time that they...

Like Mary Lou Henna?

So you got here so hard that you remember every guy's empty till of your life.

What were you wearing on May 3rd, 2009?

Whoa!

I was...

Oh!

Come to think of it.

I don't know.

Wait a minute.

Well, that's normal.

Yeah, that's not weird.

What did you wear?

I don't know.

No one dies.

It's not weird.

The earliest thing you remember, you woke up in the hospital with a gown on.

Yeah, so there I was in the hospital gown on TV on silent.

A bunch of waitresses all around me.

Waitresses?

Were you hooked up with an oligon?

Oh, were you at a scrub restaurant?

You at a scrub themed restaurant?

Oh, my God.

I know I, that feels like I was in the hospital.

There's waitresses there.

Everybody had a plate.

But nobody was eating.

What kind of food were they serving?

Just a bunch of wires and cords and stuff.

Was it good?

Were you in a best spot?

I don't know.

You got it.

Hey, sorry, sorry.

Everyone back off.

Hey, let him be.

Chuckie, do you remember what was on the TV that was playing silently in the hospital?

Yeah, it was some kind of cooking show.

It was like, I think it was a woman.

She was standing in front of a table and she had a dog on the table.

And she was looking at the dog all around and thinking about how she wanted to cook it.

Sounds like a barefoot contest.

It sounds like the meal before the koala cake.

Yeah, you might have been watching kickbows.

Did you see a kickbox?

She was going to cook the dog?

Yeah, yeah.

She was going to cook the door something.

She was looking at the dog.

So waitresses with trays of wires walking around.

You're watching a lady cook the dog silently on the television.

Was this a dream that you had?

Or is life sort of like a dream for you right now?

Yeah.

Life is like a dream.

And like it only.

I'm a d-up-a-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.

Okay, describe what you're seeing right now.

Okay, I see a spaghetti sack, a lot of trees.

There's a man with cans on his ears.

Well, at least that's accurate.

A lofeal and accurate.

Absolutely accurate.

A bus, stack of rocks, a Harvey motorcycle.

Gump shoe.

Harvey.

And Harvey Davidson, the Jewish Marley.

Harvey Davidson, the Jewish Marley.

I got here, I got a nice Harvey.

I got a rolllet watch and a Harvey motorcycle.

Is that a motorcycle with like a giant rabbit on the back?

Is that a goosie bag?

Is that a motorcycle with a giant rabbit on the back?

Or am I just happy to see myself?

Anyway, back to my store.

So, there was this waitresses going around trays of wires.

And then of course, then of course.

Of course.

And then of course, of course, someone comes in.

Okay.

And he's a man.

Who was that?

You're the policeman.

I might be from the surgery.

But he's dressed all in white.

And he's really tall.

And he's got one of those things on his head that's like a CD.

He's got a CD on his head.

Like a doctor.

Is this a doctor?

Yeah.

Maybe it was a DVD.

It could have been a DVD.

That's good call.

Oh yeah, I guess it could have been a DVD.

Or a small laser disc.

A silver LP.

Yeah.

So, he came in and he leaned over me and he kissed me on my lips.

Lucky.

It was so sweet.

Is that what woke you up?

No, I was already awake.

I was like looking around and stuff.

And he came over and he kissed me on my lips.

He said, Chuckie, you're going to be okay.

That's nice.

That's a caring doctor.

I think that might be illegal.

You might have been a salter in that olive garden.

Slash breastbite.

Press by.

Yeah.

Breastlike citizen creep like a pussy boy.

Number two.

So, there we go, huh?

Now you're happy.

So, how did it come about that you wanted to do this tribute to these?

Well, yeah.

Gary Marshall and Alan Thicke both died in the same year.

And when Gary Marshall died, we had talked about maybe doing an episode really quickly with Gillian and...

Well, I think that, yeah, people, it's one of your most beloved characters.

You did have been doing this impression of Gary Marshall almost as long as the podcast itself and a loving...

He's one of these characters that I really enjoyed interacting with because...

One of my favorites to do.

Just such an interesting backstory you created for him and what a great voice and also just an abulance and Jwadavriev, the evil about him that's just fun to be around.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I really enjoyed doing it.

So, when he died, I was very sad.

And that's the problem sometimes with doing these characters that are real people.

James Adomian ran into it when Hughal Houser passed away and Christopher Hitchens and some other people.

When you're doing real people, it's difficult.

Yeah.

And especially if you have an affection for the person, it feels weird to do it again.

If it was Tom Likeus, then...

Oh, absolutely.

Yeah.

If I were James and I would do Tom Likeus well after the day...

The day after.

So, yeah, I wasn't...

So, when we were talking about it, it was like, should we do this?

Can we do this?

And you had only met Gary Marshall once, is that right?

Yeah.

And by all accounts, a really nice guy and just a bummer when he passed away.

Yeah.

And the idea of doing it seemed...

Like capitalizing on it seems dis-taste- Yeah, and it didn't...

Because I knew that I would have had the right intention.

Like it would have been not exploitative.

It would have had cruel intentions.

But...

Just spit hanging down.

Oh, that's all I think of when I think of that movie.

That's the only thing.

It's from the commercial.

Yeah.

Hey, good looking.

I'll be back.

You pick me up later.

Yeah, I just didn't feel right to me.

Yeah.

And then after some time had passed and we were...

And then Alan Thicke was another person.

You hadn't been doing him that long, but it was...

No.

What's weird is in the lore of the Gary Marshall episodes, we had had Gillian Jacobs on every year and sometimes more than that previous to that.

And somehow she became intertwined with Gary Marshall's story where she became a seductress who wanted to marry him for his money.

Yeah.

And then Alan Thicke, another impression that you did, they were vying for each other.

Yeah.

Somehow, and then they both passed away within a few months of each other, I believe.

Yeah.

And first of all, people constantly writing to Gillian saying, hey, weird, your husbands are dead.

I know.

Which she thought was kind of funny actually.

I know.

And she brought it up on stage, I think, at one point somewhere.

I don't know.

Yeah.

Or on a radio interview or something like that.

But for Paul, I mean, it's unfortunate because those are two of your most beloved characters.

Yeah.

And it wouldn't feel right to just say, I'm a ghost now or whatever and keep doing them.

I didn't feel, to be very clear, I did not feel like this was a loss for me.

Sure.

I guess...

What this one trying to say is it's not a loss in terms of like, cravenly, you're thinking, oh, that's material like, no, it's just more like, oh, your impression of Gary Marshall was a tribute to a guy whose work has meant a lot to you.

Yeah.

And you're a big Frankie and Johnny fan.

I had to clear the loon.

Sure.

But no, I mean, you know, it was a loving tribute.

And so it's like, it felt more distasteful for you of just like, oh, let's leave.

This alone.

Yeah.

Until enough time had passed where you came up with this great idea of you do an impression of another living person, Cake Boss.

That's right, Cake Boss.

Who apparently was arrested a few years back by what people send to us.

He was on the regs arrested in 2014.

Yeah.

I don't know how...

And yet people send it as if it's a new new story.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

It's really weird.

Everyone said, don't you know, you know, I am the Cake Boss.

The Cake Boss.

And people sent it to us like, did you hear about this?

You have to do an episode about this.

Which we did.

Yes.

When it happened.

But Cake Boss in the lore of the Cake Boss.

Cake Boss.

If you've been listening to the show for a long time, Cake Boss, as Paul does it, is a character who was bitten by a...

Cake Scarab.

A cake Scarab and a cake bug.

He was bitten by both a cake bug and a cake Scarab.

Which is given to Cake Bug, which gave him the power of the second sight.

Power of the second sight.

But then a Cake Scarab allows him to speak to...

Communicate with dead people.

... both fictional and non-fictional.

As long as they have either died...

It's reasonable to assume that their character would be dead by them.

...have to have died much like, hey, spoiler alert, Han Solo in the previous Star Wars.

Now Cake Boss would be able to talk to him.

Yes, exactly.

But like a Huckleberry Finn is another example.

Turn to the Century hero could not possibly be alive.

Any Mark Twain character, yes.

Yeah, they could not be alive at this point.

That's right.

So you came up with the idea of, hey, let's get him talking to Gary Marshall and Almethic.

And just as...

Is it a saying goodbye?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Because it was the anniversary show and doing this show has meant so much to me and it's been such a big part of my life that it seemed...

I felt like enough time had passed where I knew I could do this in a nice and fun way that wouldn't be disrespectful.

Disrespectful.

Yeah, and yeah, so I just decided to go for it.

Right.

So it's weird that it became so disrespectful and insulted so many people.

I mean, that's where the moment took me.

I was like, you know what?

Fuck these guys.

All right, we need to take a break.

When we come back, we're going to have the top episode of the year.

Scott, can I just say very quickly?

What's up?

If I'm not in...

What?

The number one episode?

No!

I'm going to be very angry.

Come on!

What?

You've been in eight of the top 16.

You've been in half of...

That's only half.

If I'm not in this final episode...

You're setting yourself up for disappointment, my friend.

So you're telling me for sure?

I'm not telling you for sure.

I'm just saying that this is not a good game to play.

I am just saying that if I'm not in the top episode of the year...

This is the most dangerous game.

I'm going to be very angry.

All right.

Well, we'll see.

I mean, this is certainly a nail-biter cliffhanger.

When we come back, we'll have your...

You need your nails to hang on to that cliff!

Stop biting them while you're hanging.

We'll be right back with the top episode of the year, Comedy Bang Bang, after this.

Comedy Bang Bang, boy!

We're doing it.

This is the final segment of our Best of of 2016.

Scott, you're right.

Everything you've said is true, and I can back it up.

Nope, I've lied eight times on this episode.

That is also a liar.

Well, this is exciting.

Every year we have a countdown, and every year you never know what you're going to get, and you never know what's going to stick with the listeners.

And this year, the top episode was by far the most popular episode out of the 40,000 votes.

Let me see if I can bring up those stats of what percentage of the vote it got.

And while you're doing that, I will just reiterate to the listening audience that if I am not in this number one episode, I will be very angry.

Okay, all right.

What are the stats looking like?

The stats out of...

What's the tail of the tape?

Out of each...

This may not sound like a lot, but out of each individual, out of the percentage of how many votes it got as opposed to the other 60 episodes, it got close to 8% of the vote.

So meaning that out of 60, almost 10% of the votes came to it.

Meaning people were able to vote for 10, I believe.

So almost everyone voted for it is what I'm trying to say.

Because they're able to vote for 10, and if it got 10% of the vote, that means almost every single person voted for it.

Okay, so that makes sense.

This is the most popular episode of the year, and this one meant a lot to me.

This is your episode number one.

Number one.

All right.

Paul, you're hoping you're in this.

I'm not hoping I'm in it.

It's just a statement of fact.

If I'm not in it, I'm going to be very angry.

All right, well, this is an episode from July 24th, mid-year, some might say.

That's right.

Probably hump week of hump month, if you know what I'm saying.

What is that noise, by the way?

It's my chair, I think.

It's your chair leaning back?

Okay, I thought it was like the computer breaking down.

I was just like, Switzerland from side of the...

But Sam and I got very alarmed here, like, oh shit.

It's like we're on an old Spanish galleon.

I thought a galleon was a coin.

No, it's not.

It sure isn't.

It's a ship.

What am I thinking of?

Debloon?

Maybe.

Maybe I'm thinking of coin.

Yeah, coin.

Spanish coin?

All right, this is an episode from July 24th.

This is an episode called, and it's episode 500, and it is an episode called the 500th episode.

No, Scott?

Yes, Paul.

I ask you to read the names of the people.

I'm going to read the names of the people, and we'll see if you...

Do you know my rule?

I do know the rule.

Sam, if you could baton down the hatches, as it were, and just kind of strap everything to...

Beatty-vetees!

Just make sure that nothing is going to go flying if Paul hulks out here.

H's.

Baton down the hatches, I messed it up.

A galleon is a coin in Harry Potter.

Sam is finally listening.

Thank you very much.

This is the kind of thing that I like, Sam, to do.

This is great.

He doesn't turn on the mic, and most engineers would be like, oh, I got to get on.

I could tell him this.

He's typing it out and showing you to me.

I love it.

And you're doing this in a big font, is this an app?

And by the way, don't turn up that microphone.

Just type it out.

You're doing this in an app or something?

What exactly is this that you're using?

App called big.

What a dumb name for an app.

♪ App called big ♪ ♪ Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum ♪ ♪ All right. Let's list him down. We have Jason Mantukas, another appearance on the podcast. This makes his fifth episode. Not bad. John Gabers says, as what character do you think? I feel like I feel like you tipped it a little bit. I think his genome. I think his genome. Okay. Yes. I could see your mouth forming the.

Right.

Nick Kroll. Mmm. A mailer Damon. No, he's a chupacabra. He's one of the first.

The very first characters he ever did. I believe because it's our 500th episode, he came and did a chupacabra. Lauren Lapkis. She was big sue. She was Todd. One of her most popular characters. Mary Holland. Mary Holland was another little boy. Probably. Tommy Skuz. Tommy Skuz used a little baseball playing boy. Right. Right.

Right. And oh, looky here who's bringing up the rear. Paul F. Tomkins. Don't hook out.

Scott. I couldn't be happier. The end. The end. That's it? Yeah. I couldn't. The consequences of you not being in this were so great. Isn't this better than? And the benefit is just you saying you're happy? Yeah.

The end. This is better than me being very angry. All right.

This was the 500th episode.

The 500th was approaching. We knew we wanted to do something special. I believe I talked earlier about Andy Daley and Jason Manzukas doing... I don't even want to spoil what I had planned for it because I may do it another time. True.

But there were other things that we tried to do with it and we may save those for a future anniversary or special show. What ended up happening just because it was in July and no one's around necessarily is we... Oh, all the scrubs? No. It was actually... I was very happy that these particular people did it, but we ended up doing another one of these gang shows where a lot of people are on it.

And it's very funny. It was a lot of fun. Why don't we hear it now? This is the episode you all choose with a bullet. Wow. To number one, this is the 500th episode, the number one episode of Comedy Bang Bang of 2016. Number one. Let me explain who's here. We have my energy now.

Is this Charles? Yeah, I'm just best. Is this a classic Charles already? Bye! You take care.

This is your first time listening because you heard that there's a big 500th episode.

I would say hang up, start at the top. Hang up. Hang up.

Hang up. I'll do things on phones.

Everyone's telling me podcast or on phones. Podcasts aren't phone calls.

Why call it? We call it and listen. No, that's not the time.

That's not how it works either.

To our voicemail, I'll go in.

How am I calling in? Oh, super. Yes.

It was not the baby. Okay. I'm calling in from my crib. Let me explain. Please, let me explain who's here. This is already a retired train territory. Let me get read it online.

We have my intern, Geno. For 500 episodes, he's been to approximately 0.01% of those.

Yep. That's about it. I need college credits, but I don't want to fucking do slave labor for you.

You know? He's currently pouring everyone's waters. Could I get one? Yeah, hold on. We just got to get for all the people in the room that have already been mentioned. I got to get them boys.

We also have my nephew Todd is here. Yeah, I talked about him. How are you doing, Todd?

My palms are hairy because I was turban too much. Oh, God.

You're a turban? Is that where you get pulled behind a boat in like an Indian man's headdress?

Mass turbating.

Todd, you've been masturbating in my house. Yeah, my palms are hairy. It's a fucking monkey. They traditionally have no hair on their conscience. Yeah, that's the tradition. Your hands are as hairy as the monkeys like gnaw. Yeah, as a as a as a as a as a as a as a as our hairless as well a lot of times.

Is that what your mom's there anything though? Yeah, I love monkeys.

Todd, I don't appreciate that kind of language, please. How old is Todd?

Todd, middle school. I couldn't get a babysitter today, so I had I don't need a sitter. I can watch myself. You're in middle school, young man. Oh, thanks for the compliment.

played young man. Yes. Usually I call you a young lady.

Yeah, accidentally.

We also have a featured recently in the blockbuster movie, The House. We have yes, man's who kiss. Congratulations. Thank you so much, Chupacabra.

Thank you, Scott. Thank you. Congrats on 500 big episodes.

Thank you very much. You've been here since very early on in the podcast history.

I don't know exactly what number your first episode. I don't know either. But it's been about 450 with you. So welcome. Let's allow. I'm thrilled to be here. 450 more.

I've been helping Jason out record underground comedy bang bang episodes.

Yeah, it's like splinter episode. The shadow the shadow. I'm the dark web. They're called the shadow. You can get us kids and Molly from the same website and boner pills. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

The kid gives me boner pills before we record every shadow.

Yeah, we pop Seattleis and just fucking record. Our faces are super hot and our dicks are mega hot.

Okay. All right. I mean, I don't know how you face gets when you take Seattle.

I'm young. I'm Gino. Yeah, Gino.

But he does. He keeps saying he's got that hot face. Got that Seattleis face.

I want to get that. We did. We did. We took one of those.

Don't don't don't don't get. Oh, my God. It's hot. It's hot.

Todd is taking 20.

So let's just try the two ages. Oh, oh, yeah. We're doing a great job. So far. Thank you so much.

We also have Chupacabra, the radio DJ who is. I'm letting you talk. Finish right. I'm not going to say anything. Okay, who is here? Yeah.

Remember that?

From just catch phrases. Yeah. Well, you're at 480 episodes.

You say, Kooka Riku, you talk to the talk to a baby. Also, there's a goat. There's a goat. There's a goat, man.

They are all here today. They are nasty. We are all very rusty.

That's good. So you I won't feel you won't feel good. No, I haven't seen you in a while too, but almost as if you retired. It's as if it's as if I had tired of myself.

Well, thank you for coming back to. What's up in Mexico?

You've been in Mexico?

On a Mexican radio. Yes, Mexican radio in barbecue to Guanes.

How do you know that? Oh, my favorite song. I'm a radio major in Nassau community.

Oh, oh. So all songs are radio. Was there an entire class?

It was one semester where I took a class on radio gaga by queen Mexican radio by whatever band that was. And then radio was a nine credit because there have several albums. So what's your favorite radio head song? I'm the national anthem. Wait, you realize that's not the actual national anthem?

Oh, say. You asked me what's my favorite radio head song? I answered the question.

National anthem. I apologize. When Tom you are saying national anthem at the subway series.

Hey, Todd, Todd. Todd's playing is super rec-op like a guitar right now.

I've got one of those like those temperature things that you point at gun at someone at food.

Elazer thermometer. Mr. Friesgum? Elazer thermometer. Todd's face is 110 degrees.

Yeah, cook a turkey on me. Yeah, that's a good way to get at it.

If you ever need to cook your cams. You cook turkeys on 100 degrees of it.

Yeah, it takes 10 days. Slow and low, baby. That is the tempo.

Also a song. I told you, Beastie boys were on the radio. We had to learn about them.

Radio. Wait, so anything that was on the radio? You had to learn?

Oh, yeah, we did that. I thought it was- I thought it was- I thought it was- Do you know that song?

I don't know that song. I don't know that song.

Because I'm alive? Okay.

Fucking heard music from different eras no matter what I'm from.

All right, Todd. I don't know where you picked up all this language.

Certainly not for me. I know it from you, dad.

No, no, your dad.

Wait, that actually brings up an important question because there is a lot of talk online that people are saying that Todd is your actual son and that you are saying he's your nephew.

Ah, that's ridiculous. I mean, obviously my sister had you.

How do we know for sure?

How do we know that your sister had Todd and that you didn't have Todd and give him to your sister?

Yeah, I got your butt.

You're you're you're- Yeah.

No, I don't- We know Todd's not a butt, baby.

Yeah.

I don't think that's what Jason's saying.

Don't like that.

You are butt, baby.

I don't know. I can't tell.

Oh, how do you go?

Todd, smell yourself.

Todd is the right to know.

I smell shit.

So?

Have you guys ever met before, by the way, Todd?

No, I'm scared.

He's not a stranger to me.

I'm getting- I'm sweating based off how hot Todd's face is right now.

His macheaus is so fucking hard.

Gave him so much Seattle.

I gave him so much Seattle.

I said look at how much Seattle's I have and then he pack man them down.

Like power pellets.

No water needed.

Yeah, no, that was crazy.

Great swallow.

Are you bragging about- Great swallow on this kid.

Yeah, you know- Tod pills, no water.

Hey, do you know- Don't say great swallow on this kid to a middle schooler, okay?

Hey, the kid's got a good swallow.

Can't tell a lie.

Should we do it?

That's the- You're unable to tell a lie.

I am brutally honest.

Let me ask anyone who reads my Yelp column.

What have you been reviewing?

Have you been- Do you still have a byline on Yelp?

I just keep editing one review of my hero in Jerusalem Avenue in Belmont.

Just keep adding to it.

Keep adding detail to it.

Keep adding details to it.

Just life journey, you know.

Do you change details because you keep going?

Or all based on the one you've buried?

I read this hysterical book.

It was someone's diary.

So I just started keeping a diary.

And Frank?

Yeah, the paddock chick.

So funny.

She couldn't go anywhere.

No, it's hysterical.

It's like Narnia but without Mr. Thumness.

I've never heard that review.

Mr. Thumness, m- Oh wait, that's what you're sexually attracted to.

I like animals and humans.

So what?

Tod's dick just got harder somehow.

Yeah, it's harder and smaller.

It's visibly beating.

Like a hot.

It's like a marble.

Ouch.

It looks like a bullet.

Why also why is it turd wearing pants?

I have to double duck it if I want to come on the boat.

One of our rules.

It's one of our rules.

House rules.

The house always wins.

Do you know that Jason?

Yes I do.

If you get beat the house, be the house.

Exactly.

Do you know you're all right?

Oh yeah, I'm just thinking about that book.

I read that hysterical book.

Yeah.

Be quiet.

The bad guys are downstairs.

That's fucking wild.

Cheerful.

Gina, you know that's a true story, right?

I have a crush on Hans.

I hope he says something to me when I see him later.

Have you finished the book yet?

No, not yet.

I don't want to know spoilers.

I want to see how it ends.

I'm excited.

Okay.

Yeah.

What do you think is going to happen?

Oh, I think she's going to find love.

Yeah.

I really would like for us to be on this show together.

When you read those.

Could you Skype in when you're reading the final chapter?

Oh yeah.

I mean, if I might do a thing where I...

What is it called when you get like a book over voicemail and you listen to it on your phone?

Nope.

Like an audio book?

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's not our voicemail.

When someone calls in, they finish and write.

And reads a book to you.

Yeah, yeah.

I got John Goodman's leaving me voicemails on my audible app all the time.

John Goodman.

He's reading the diary of a prank.

Yeah.

Why is he reading?

John Goodman's saying this song, but I...

And Frank was too expensive, they said.

This is, by the way, the show where we talk to interesting people.

That is our new tagline.

I think it says it all.

It's succinct.

It really says exactly what encapsulates this show.

The show's the Wii.

The show where we talk to interesting people.

Who's Wii?

I guess the Royal ones get so...

Wait a minute, you guys don't exist?

That's...

Yeah.

Are you telling us we're living in like, what's identity?

The Jomperyous Act movie?

The Jomperyous Act Motel Show.

Do we all have the same birthday?

Every one of the pictures that accompanies this fucking podcast is just a picture of you alone on a couch.

Really?

Yup.

Is this like a leftovers thing where I'm seeing people that...

I'm sorry, I know I gave leftovers.

So people haven't seen it.

I gave leftovers spoilers recently too.

Really?

Well, the spoiled leftovers?

Oh, you're a Yoy.

Don't eat them.

I don't want to see that.

You made me.

Is this your...

But we have a new segment that Todd wants to do called Oyo-Yoy.

Are you ready to do it?

You told me you have five different Oyo-Yoys.

So here we go.

Everyone, this is Todd with his Oyo-Yoys.

You thought it was nighttime?

It's a puppy of the night.

Oyo-Yoy.

Four more.

Do you have anything that maybe you came up with before you set that?

If you ever go to a luau and you see the girl shaking her rump, you can't touch it.

Oyo-Yoy.

What did you go to a luau?

At a luau, it might more be like a poi-y-yoy.

Poi-poi-poi.

Or a poi-y-yoy.

You got it.

Oh no.

That did not sit well with some of our guests.

All right.

That's...

We're retiring that segment.

Fine.

And next time you have a segment, you better pitch it to me in more detail.

Fine.

Oh god.

Wow.

You guys are freaking cute.

You're so cute.

Oh.

Shit.

Wow.

How many you?

And I hate that just sleeping bed next to you.

Wait a minute.

Wow.

We don't...

What am I?

Oyo-Yoy.

What am I, Rockefeller?

I can't afford other beds.

She falls off his pair's wonder where it makes a line between...

It's like the Great Wall of China.

The Cleaner they used.

The Great Wall of China.

Oh.

We're both boys.

As we always say...

You both say to each other we're both boys and then go to bed in the same bed.

You better come clean if whether you're her uncle or dad, because if you're a dad, you cannot sleep in a bed next to him.

It's 2017.

You got to throw around.

You got to be gender neutral at your pronouns.

And he's been grabbing, pissing in a ladies bathroom at every restaurant I go to.

What was our last restaurant you went through?

Went to my hero in Jerusalem Avenue and said, Yes, I know.

We know.

And you could drop heat in the ladies bathroom.

I don't know what that means.

It means blast one.

A big sloppy deuce.

You're steaming out your book.

You're not turban.

No, I'm not turban in there.

Turban in the ladies restroom, I wish.

Turban in the girl's room.

I can only turban when I'm lying down.

My shoulder hurts too much if I'm standing up.

Really?

I need to be lying down with my dick pointed at my face.

That feels true.

Feels real true.

So specific.

Get on.

So face and that turban up.

What's going on with your shoulder though?

Yeah, I think I have Tommy John.

Tommy John the underwear?

Tommy John the underwear.

I got stuck on my arm.

And I fucking, I was embarrassed.

I was like, how do you try, I was at Macy's and Roosevelt Field Mall.

Wow, Feliz, you all this.

I didn't realize you were rich, genome.

Yeah, I got a little bit of money from the settlement.

Oh, wait, what's going on?

I'm.

You haven't told us about this.

I never told you I was a, I was a bait boy for the Catholic Church.

We have not heard about this, genome.

You were a bait boy.

I was a bait boy working with the FBI.

And then I ended up having to sue the FBI because they let me go.

Because I got what they call in too deep.

Oh no.

How long was this and how old were you?

I was a concubine for a few different priests.

A concubine.

But I was, so you got too deep and so you had to sue the FBI.

Well, here's the thing.

They hired, they hired these kids to go undercover into the Catholic Church, you know, be all the boys and shit.

It's like a 21 jump street situation.

Yeah, sort of like, yeah.

You're a bait.

It's like the only show where you actually feel guilt for pedophiles.

Right?

Is that the tagline of that show?

Yeah.

Humanizing pedophiles since 96.

I love when people are embarrassed on TV.

I love it.

It is really, really fun.

It is one of, I will think to catch up with them.

It's not a very ass type of show.

When they're fucking funny.

It's a prank show.

It's one of the best prank shows.

I mean, technically.

They're going to hook up with that little girl.

And then it turns out she's 20 and this is all joke.

I like when a fat weirdo shows up with a six-packed zima to hang out with a 14-year-old.

Fucking nasty freaks.

She'll die.

I don't want you watching that joke.

Yeah, so I was undercover as an altar boy and I was just getting, you know, turned out by a bunch of these priests.

Oh, but how old are you, Gina?

I'm 17.

17 seems quite old.

Yeah, but I'm very skinny.

So I look really young.

Yeah, and I'm underdeveloped because I don't have any body, like real muscle mass or anything like that.

Right.

I want, I guess, it's called a twink.

And these guys, you know, they turn me out.

They shook me around.

Stop saying they turned you out.

They shook me up.

Spit roasting me, flipped in and reversed.

Oh, come on.

No, missing that and reversed.

They missed me in that alley alley.

Yeah.

They turned into a verb.

No.

Got to first let me search it and they would put both hands up my ass.

Why would you let them do this?

I did the thing, you know, like that they do at Sesame Street, where like those grown men have their hands up, the little things, asses and their toys.

Those are puppet.

Yeah, yeah, I did that.

I was puppet.

You were puppet by a couple of priests as far to like, some sort of act of contrition thing.

You don't know what, what is it?

Was it a show?

Now the, those are brains about this.

The MPI said you were not actually working for the MPI.

I misread an email.

What email did you get?

For the emails.

Exactly.

Lock her up.

Kill her up.

I was fucking, I don't look, that's the thing.

And so I thought I was undercover.

So I come to the FBI and I'm like, right guys, I got plenty of evidence.

They're like, we don't know what you're talking about.

I was like, I guess I'll go get more evidence.

Oh no.

I went back into the rectory for another year and I was wearing a wire, you know, and I so.

What kind of wire do you think is a wire?

Oh, I had like a choker necklace.

I had a mouse tied around my neck, a USB mouse.

Oh no.

Now they make a wireless.

Now I know.

So I'm in there, you know, and they're fucking slapping me around.

Okay, we don't need the details.

They're throwing me up with the coin star.

Do you know what coin star you know?

What is that?

They fill your ass up with change and then pull dollar bills out of your mouth.

I don't know.

How is that a thing?

I don't know.

You're the fucking priest man.

Are you in a magic trick?

Wait, is it a magic trick?

I think it might be a magic trick.

What happens to the change?

They go like water into wine.

Coldy into fives.

So it's translucent.

Yeah, it's consecration or something.

Then call it.

Look, long story short, I get out.

You're shorter.

The shorter.

The FBI goes, look, we don't know what you were doing there.

And I was like, I'm suing you guys.

And if this story gets out, you're fucked.

So then Comey came to my house and handed me.

Comey.

Oh, Comey.

Wait, Comey came to us.

How long ago was this?

This guy is fucking freak.

Is this going to be in his book?

It's just three years ago.

Wait, is it?

I'm 20.

Oh, okay.

20.

I'm in a fucking college intern.

I'm in.

That tracks.

So Comey came to my house.

We played one-on-one basketball.

He fucking brushes.

Of course.

Yeah.

He's like six, seven.

Yeah, burns out.

He was sitting down when I challenged him.

You challenged him.

I was like, if you...

Wait, you challenged him to one- He said, we can't give you this money for the lawsuit.

I'm like, if I beat you in one-on-one basketball.

Because we have a hoop outside my mom's house.

That's great, man.

What?

Congrats.

How'd you get that?

Oh, my mom shaved up for a decade.

Do it, dad.

Put it on the way away.

Oh, no.

I'm not going to give you a hoop.

Oh, wow.

Oh, my hoops.

Did you see Todd called Scott dad and Scott answered?

Yep.

C detective.

Condeticative.

Okay, look.

Come on, Scott.

Is that the end?

That's your story.

Cool.

He ended up beating me.

But out of sympathy, he gave me 100 and K.

100 and K.

Gave me 100 dollars and a biggest bag academy.

And I was able to show that academy for another few hundred bucks.

Now I have that money to do whatever I want.

That's great.

Yeah.

And that's how I got the money to do the thing you got in the sense of what?

Was it crazy molested by a priest for an emperor of yours?

That's it.

I made out with 800 dollars.

And there it is.

The number one, Cal Solomon, we should mention.

Put your phone down.

I was trying to close the app.

But still appropriate to celebrate.

You were Cal Solomon.

We didn't mention before we went into it.

That's right.

Doing the script about.

His own straight out of Compton type script of the sugar hill gang.

That's right.

Well, that does it.

I mean, let's run down some of the stats.

Paul.

Nine episodes in nine of the top 16.

Nine of your 11 appearances were in the top countdown.

Well, that is very gratifying.

And yes.

It's a testament to your work here on the show.

You did some great work on the show this year.

And you were by far in the most episodes.

Jason Mansuchus follows you being on five.

Five of his episodes were in the top 16.

John Gaboris and Drew Tarver were in four.

Tied.

I wouldn't have thought Drew Tarver necessarily would have been four, but he was always playing Keith in those big gang episodes.

And then he ended up in that other one.

The people who were on three were Lauren Lapkis, who by the way was out for a long chunk because she was in England filming her movie.

That's correct.

So I feel like she's a little underrepresented on the show this year.

But that's- Who knows what could have happened had she been around?

That's true.

Don't take work when you're offered.

Oh, watch the throne.

Lauren Lapkis, Nick Kroll, Zeke Nicholson, Toni Newsom, Mary Holland, Ryan Gull, and Tim Balts were on three of these episodes.

The best run of episodes, the consistent stretch that was voted on with the most episodes was 510 through 518.

That was pound foolish.

All the way through.

Let me list the ones that are in there that were voted on.

We had the more Zuksnik interruption.

We had What's Your Aim with Bobby Moynihan.

We had Pound Foolish, of course.

Corn dog horn dog was 518.

We had the Calvin's twins return.

Those were all in that stretch of 510 through 518.

That got a big percentage of the vote.

No episodes from January, June, or August were in the top six.

Wow.

That's just what happened.

Not to say that those were lean months, but because some of them were just in the bubbling under countdown.

And I'll tell you some of the ones that were bubbling under.

I mentioned Return to Suicide House Part 666.

That was in the top 10 for a while, and then just didn't get enough votes at the end.

Whose CB beef was just under?

And the other one that got all the way up to, I think, six at one point, and then dropped out of the countdown late was solo bolo cincollo.

Solo and each or this is the fifth solo bolo that Ben Schwartz and I have done.

I believe three of them have been on the top 10, a top countdown each year.

And this is the first year that it is not represented on our countdown and was popular enough to be voted early on, but then didn't get enough votes late.

That's interesting.

It is interesting, isn't it?

It is, I said it was.

It is.

This year we had some wonderful episodes.

We also had some wonderful musical guests that I wanted to.

That's true.

Musical guests.

That I want to highlight, Electric Guest.

That's right.

Was a wonderful band that came on.

American football made their second appearance.

That's right.

They're very charming guys.

Manchester Orchestra, a great band that I had never met before, who let it be known that they were fans of the show and wanted to be on.

And I loved their records and was surprised that they had listened to it so much.

They did a wonderful episode with Jess McKenna and Zach Reno of the Off Book Podcast where they improvised a musical the whole time.

And they got to improvise a song with Manchester Orchestra.

That's pretty amazing.

They got to do with Manch Orch.

Also, The National was in one of the episodes it's here, where we got to travel to Fleetwood Mac Studio and watch them play a little mini concert for us.

Fleetwood Mac?

Yeah.

We watched Fleetwood Mac.

We were like, honestly national?

We prefer them.

And Mr. Heavenly, of course, was last, not last week because that was the best up of the week before.

That's the engineer Brett's, the band that he is currently serving under.

And that wraps it up for the Countdown, Paul.

What do you think?

Scott, I think that last year was a great year for the podcast.

You know, as you know, I'm a listener as well as a participant.

And you're also a member.

That's right.

And so many fun and funny episodes.

And it was fun to see so many new people and people that have become, you know, recent regulars.

It's been a ball.

It's been a really entertaining year.

And from what I see people talking about online, they agree that this has been a very strong year for the day.

I think this was a strong year.

I think it was fun for me.

We look, every week is a new adventure for the show.

We're not doing a show where we do the same thing every week.

It's a variety show.

And every week, it sometimes runs the gamut from, hey, let's put these people on the show who work together a lot.

Like episodes like the more Zucsnick interruption, those three guys are great friends and vacation together. And you know, you know, when you put them together, they're going to have a lot of camaraderie, much like the pre-chowder episode with John Gabris and Manzukas and you and I.

You know those episodes are going to be fun.

But the fun for me to do the show is also the episodes where, hey, these people have never met before.

And let's see what comes out of those.

And there were a lot of new people that we worked with this year who have never done the show before or are just starting out to do the show.

It's great to see people like Tawny and Ryan and Drew and Zeke and Carl in so many of the top episodes. It's great to see that.

I hope that as the years go by, if the show continues, that is the case where there will always be turnover and old friends come back.

But the goal of the show is to introduce new people and just do new things.

You know, and that's something that I never wanted just to have a show where people say like, oh, I listened to it for, I'm sure people do say it about this, but oh, I listened to it for a while and then it got to be the same thing over and over.

So I just stopped listening to it.

I want there to be turnover and I want new things to happen.

Absolutely.

And you know, 2018, we're here.

We out here.

We out here, definitely.

Who knows what the future holds for Comedy Bank?

No one.

No one does.

So I do know that on Monday we'll have our traditional episode with Ben Schwartz and Ray Schuessands.

That's a tradition that we have kept for quite a number of years.

But after that, I do think this year without making people run into a panic, this year may be maybe a transitional year.

I don't know.

May something maybe different about this year.

I don't know.

Your glasses are going to turn into sunglasses?

Yeah, I think.

Yes, transitional year for me.

This is exciting.

We don't know.

We don't know what's going on with Comedy Bank, but it is the greatest pleasure of my life to be able to put out the show every week and as long as we have done it.

And the fact that honestly, this year I was kind of like, are people still listening to the show?

I haven't looked at the stats or numbers of how many downloads or listens we've had on it for a long time.

And I've just kind of been doing it and been in it.

And towards the end of the year, I was like, are people listening?

I can't tell.

I can't really tell.

I know that people are very nice and send nice messages and people do listen.

I was like, so to see that we are in the most downloaded podcasts of Apple Comedy Division, this is a lot of qualifiers, is great to know that people are still out there listening to it.

And I appreciate them doing it.

I also want to say, Paul, thank you very much for making time for eight years now to do this with me.

Not only the best ofs, which take a long time look, honestly, we started this seven hours ago.

We started at 10 a.m. today and it is now 514.

So we started a while ago.

I appreciate you clearing the decks and your schedule to do this.

And not only that, but also doing the 11 episodes you did.

And nine of them being such great quality.

I don't know what happened to the other two.

Honestly.

I'll just have to try harder next year.

Okay. Well, we'll see.

Scott, thank you for that.

And I want to say thank you to the fans, the people who have discovered me through this show and have said such nice things and have been so supportive.

It means a lot to me.

And even though I don't, I find it hard to respond to people who say nice things because it feels I get a little embarrassed.

Well, also it's, I think, the way you were brought up.

It's you feel like, oh, I don't, I shouldn't take advantage of this or I shouldn't like validate this because maybe you don't, it's not that you feel like you don't deserve it.

Well, no, that's exactly what it feels like.

I was brought up to feel that I was not good.

You're not worth the paper you were printed on.

No, that's right.

Not even good in concept.

So it does mean a lot to me.

And I am always appreciative of little notes that people send me.

And it, it, please know that I, that does not mean nothing to me.

Yes.

And myself as well, I don't often respond mainly because I don't want to be online all day.

But I do appreciate anytime anyone sends me a nice thing.

Don't like it when people send me the mean things.

I like those less.

It's true.

I like those less, but it does, it is really gratifying that people listen to this show.

And I want to say that I've said this before and I'll say it again that the hours that I have spent with you in this room have been among the happiest of my life.

This show means a lot to me and I am very grateful to you for having me be a part of it.

Thank you very much, Paul.

And this is, I believe, the last episode ever that we're going to record in this room.

Oh, that's true.

Because the studio is moving tomorrow, I believe.

So this is...

I meant this room figuratively.

Right.

Counting the previous two.

You're counting the previous ones.

Yeah.

What about that cracked in that we used to record in with that?

It's fun there too.

Yeah.

It was fun.

Yeah.

Even with all the people shouting outside the window.

Absolutely.

They wanted crack.

Well, I also want to thank everyone here.

Oh, but we're moving to a new, to a bigger studio.

To a bigger studio.

Yes.

That's happening in the New Year.

So the next episodes that you hear from this show will have a different sound, perhaps.

But this is a wonderful room.

But, and I remember, I believe I taped the very first episode of a podcast in this room.

The You Talking You Two to Me that we did when there were no yellow things on the walls and sounded a bit echoey.

I believe we were the first show to ever record in this room.

So are we the last to ever record in this room?

Or are there's probably some things going on tomorrow?

There can't be.

Don't let anyone record it.

Bar the room if you can.

I don't care how fucked up the schedule gets.

Make them all go in next studio.

Make them all go in the other room because this is mine.

Baby.

Oh, I say baby too.

Sam's typing up furiously in Hollywood.

Handball.

Ah, perfect.

Jesus.

They're the last ones.

All right.

Perfect.

Let the last show be the least listened to show.

The very most of us be the least of us.

I also want to thank everyone here at Earwolf and Midroll.

Thanks to the engineers who spend so much time having to listen to us.

And honestly, you get paid.

So it's a fair trade.

No, we've had such a great staff here pretty consistently.

Yeah.

Sam, I'm going to allow you to turn up that mic one time.

One time.

How long have you been working at?

Four years this morning.

Four years.

How long does it feel like?

Exactly four years.

Oh, nice.

Really?

Two of a day to the mid- One to one.

That's not bad.

That's pretty good.

It's, I don't, there are very few jobs that I've had consistently over four years.

The Comedy Bank Bank TV show and doing this podcast are about it.

And I'm not here at this podcast all day every day.

So that's very impressive, Sam.

And, and Brett has been in here even longer and Cody.

Well, it's not even.

Somehow he's still here, right?

Right.

It's weird.

And we got Ryan, of course.

Who am I missing?

Am I missing anyone?

I think that's everyone that works here.

That's everyone.

And not only the people who record the shows, but the staff out there who, who, who schedule the shows and much like Mussolini, make the trains run on time.

Very appreciative to them.

2018 is going to be interesting.

We'll see what happens.

But thank you to everyone who listened.

It is really great.

We're going to take you out on another song that, and this is a long one.

So you may have noticed we're saying goodbye even with, you know, 14 minutes left to go on a show.

That's very long.

This is from the episode that I mentioned, solo bolo cincollo that dropped out of the top countdown.

Every time we do the solo bolo cincollo, Ben and I do something called the Olympic song challenge.

Now, this is where we, one of us starts singing a song, and that leads the next person to think of a song and so on and so forth.

And we see how long we can go.

We've never done one this long before.

This is a very long one.

And the interesting part about it is over the last few, maybe all five, I don't know, a gentleman by the name of Michael Hartigan, who's out there, has taken these long, sometimes, erithmic, and maybe they go in and out of tune, perhaps.

Unlistenable.

Okay.

That's a little too far.

But he's taken these improvised songs that we sing and set them to beautiful orchestrations that he creates.

And this time when we finished, we knew it was going to be a challenge, and it was going to be the toughest one that he ever did.

But somehow he pulled it off.

Michael, you pulled it off somehow, and this is the best one he's ever done.

This, I mean, honestly, knowing what we did and how he strung it all together, it's really quite impressive.

So I wanted everyone to hear it to take us out to the ear.

This'll be it.

Paul, Sam, thank you very much.

Listeners, thank you, and we'll take you out.

And we'll see you on Monday with the first episode of 2018.

Take it away, Michael Hartigan.

There you see her.

Sitting there across the way.

She don't got a lot to say, but there's something about her.

And you don't know why, but you die in the dryer.

You gotta kiss the girl.

Shala, la, la, la, don't be shy.

Yaya, yaya, yaya, kiss the girl.

Shala, just run and step up.

Oh, girl, just what I have.

That's all they really want.

Some fun when the working day is done.

Oh, girl, they wanna have fun.

Oh, girl, just wanna have you through the wilderness.

I didn't know how I lost down ones.

Then I lost you.

Like a virgin.

Hey!

But for the very first time, Yo, like a virgin.

Feel your heartbeat next to your mind.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Here she comes.

Watch out for her, she'll leave you up.

Oh, here she comes.

She's a man either.

One, two, three, four.

Private eyes.

Oh, watchin' you.

Where I keep on rollin' by the people rollin'.

I'm talkin' about rollin'.

Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' rollin', rollin' rollin'.

Rollin', rollin', rollin' rollin' rollin' rollin'.

Get her to the rim.

Oh, good.

Do, do, do.

Drag me in the water.

Take me to the rim.

Oh, watchin' me down.

Oh, watchin' me fallin' on my head.

Let down a mean that I can only mare and red.

Drag it on the red.

Just keep onin' on my head.

Drag it on the rim.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'.

Rolla, rolla.

Look at my umbrella.

Rolla, rolla.

Get to the rim.

Against my window.

Oh, I can't stand the rain.

Against my window.

I wish it would rain.

I wish I was a little bit taller.

I wish it was a taller.

I wish I had a girl look good.

I would call it rich.

I had a rabbit and a hat with a butt.

A six-twamp ballin'.

Yo, I wish I had my way.

Cause every day would be a Friday.

You'd eat the speed on the highway.

I would play ghetto games.

Then my kids get on names.

Little moopy big alley-ray.

Hey ladies in the place for callin' out to you.

Whoa.

Never been a city kid through all blue ones.

But more to me than you ever know.

And I got more hits than showerin' our own.

I'm free, stop cussmin', hand, stop flooring.

Take women on TV with the help of child buttery.

Oh.

Hey ladies, get.

Hey ladies.

All the single ladies.

Pick your hands up.

Get your hands up.

Look at your hands up.

Get your hands up.

A tale is all this time.

Buh-du-du-doo-doo.

Like prepping without the yeast.

Maybe no one cares.

The leaves will not bear.

The beauty and the world.

What's this?

It's something very strange.

What's this?

It's rambled, do-b-al-doo.

I can't explain.

It's a bit of a zone and what a moment I want to see.

Our guests.

Be our guest.

But our service is a test.

Try a better run or do-kitty.

And we are rather rich.

Be our guest.

You Okay.

Okay.
