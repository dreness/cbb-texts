just gonna say something by that person no you're not you're the gentle teddy bear of comedy you know i have been looking for a moniker for oil yep james round had the hardest working show man in show business hardy working she got working she feels a bit zujiga you know what there are a lot of entertainers that have kind of uh uh king of pop a lot of people yeah and you know michael jackson that was one that he asked for himself because he was a little upset that he didn't have one you know everyone else had had stuff like james brown and stuff like that and then uh what is uh say madonna what is she what does she know what is she well we all know she or as the material girl of course or madge we all remember her from back in the 90s she used to shock us and uh then put out music as well it was her side gig putting out music but she yeah and then somebody came along and basically is a similar very similar very similar artist lady gaga we all know that her uh art pop record will be coming out soon we all know that or has come out soon um what what is your opinion of the state of modern music well you know i love i love a good groove i love grooves i'm a little bit out of the loop having learned that doing another who charted i didn't know any of the songs is up one um modern modern music modern we call it hmm uh what do you got what do you what do you want to what oh i'm i'm saying if you if you're listening to music in your Subaru what would you listen to i have a i have a phone here that i can read you some of my music okay let's hear it might be embarrassing and now a touch oh you know i was listening to it my way over here the field burned out it's a really good song and it's uh music i don't usually listen to i don't know if it's trance or trip hop dubstep something like that a lot of skrillex uh but i was listening to that on the way over here they're good yeah they're uh trippy music whatever that is and it's good with headphones on because it has a lot of layers to it now you don't have a car radio you just wear headphones i do have a car radio scott but it doesn't have a hypo jack no so you just wear headphones it's illegal it is illegal yeah somebody told me that the other day i could get a ticket yeah but you don't care about tickets though why because if a cop pulled you over and said i'm gonna give you a 250 dollar ticket you could just pull out variety the latest variety show him a headline saying zak gala finakis stars in movie does not give a shit about 250 dollars and throw it in the cop's face and he legally has to take it would i have to give that headline made yeah because that's a good idea you have to imagine showing a cop of a headline for a fake variety it doesn't matter who it is it could be joe schmoh or whatever but you've printed up guy and Subaru doesn't give a shit what cop has to say well just read this now i kind of want to do this such a good idea uh no one steal that before zak can do it we got to have you back on to to hear the yeah i got to get pulled over yeah i know that's the really hard part because you're a very safe driver i am a very safe driver other than that defensive driver yeah you have to be ten and two uh i don't go that far but i'm a very defensive driver never been in uh i haven't been a record in a long long time what's the last rec that you were in year and severity my father was driving me to my high school sweethearts this is last year house and he wouldn't let me drive because it was snowing and uh he's like i said i'm not gonna let you drive he drove and then we ended up in a in a field spun out so that was the only avoiding a car or just no he just just slippery roads but boy was that sweet justice with my dad wouldn't let me drive and then he got to a rec and that was the last yeah i don't think i've ever been in any you've never hit a car you've driving yourself i i mean if i had time to think about it i'm sure that maybe you have time well we always always keep thinking that this is live if you even have a world live uh we'll give you a moment sit here and think about i've been i've been in accidents with cars but i wasn't in the car i've been hit by cab in new york oh oh that's right i've been hit a couple times my cars but not bad didn't you roll or blading didn't you tell a story on one of our live episodes about a cab that you chased or threw something at no it wasn't a cab it was probably uh it was a it was a fancy car and i threw a bottle these guys these guys spit in my face i was walking over the brooklyn bridge and i was a little drunk and i was walking through leadlow street to the brooklyn bridge and uh this jag you know what jaguar oh jaguar oh how do you pronounce that jaguar jaguar jaguar jaguar jaguar i know it 's wrong of me but people in fancy cars this sense of entitlement i know it's wrong because not just because you drive a nice jag doesn't mean that you're not a good person but if it had been a tracelle i wouldn't have cared but they cut me off and i hit it with my hand like you know don't do that i'm a pedestrian i'm a pedestrian here i'm walking here which is what you say in new york i slapped the the car and i thought that was good and uh tap on my shoulder 20 seconds later 20 seconds later i had headphones on i didn't know i couldn't oh yeah and uh these giant guys both spit in my face and then uh they went away and i ran after them and i went to a trash can to get a beer bottle to throw at the car and remember thinking saying to myself out loud nobody spits in zegel in x's face like some kind of and this was where were you in your career at this point that you had that sense of talking about sense of that anywhere i would have said that you know nobody spits in zegel ocarman's face i mean i i appreciate if you were to say that about me but i wouldn 't say that i would take up for you if anybody spit in your face i would be right after somebody for sure that's so nice i'm not violent but i i you got to stand up for yourself it is a little hard these days though with so many crazy people in the world um you know you never know how people are gonna act i know you know what i mean i mean i've seen some crazy stuff happen always best to be a pacifist it it like uh i saw in a movie theater once i don't think i've ever talked about this on this program but i once saw three movies in one day where i would like sneak into theater from theater to theater we'll be right back with a world's worst bragger going to the act um and uh i i don't think i've ever said that maybe i right um go to the act i went to uh i went to beauty and the beast the cartoon the disney cartoon yep cuffs starring christians later and then ended it with jfk the last one back yeah so this is 90 i would have been 98 no 92 or 93 something around there uh save jfk for last the three plus hour one was the last one and during the entire movie of jfk a woman who was sitting in the most of us were sitting in the back i was in the second the last row uh a woman who was kind of by herself down in the second row right by the screen had brought her four kids all super young and one was running around throughout the entire movie yelling and like sort of screaming we all just kind of sat there and took it for two and a half hours we sat there and took it at the two and a half hour mark the woman grabs all of her kids like she's had enough she can't go to jfk and have some peace with her kids she grabs them all spanks the one who is yelling and then grabs them all and starts taking off towards the back of the theater everyone in the theater applauds right the old woman right behind me i guess applauds a little too long and is the last one to stop applauding right as the woman passes her the woman with the kids screams at the old woman how dare you make fun of me when my kid has an attack of the shits and then open hand smacks the old woman in the face and then runs out of the theater and then the old woman was like uh henry go and then her her old man husband she had an old man husband she wasn't you know one of those old like you know gills grandmothers i'd like to fuck who you know she had an old man husband um she um hen ry got up and like chased after and called the cops and cops were called and meanwhile we have a half hour like to go on henry henry's the her old man husband oh okay i clearly imitated this woman i said henry which is an old woman voice oh i didn't understand that's what you were saying yeah she said henry go help help henry went and chased the old woman the young girl woman yeah the mother uh i can't recall if she was a milf but the old woman was not a gilf um and um and that's the end of that story but you ever seen a good gilf you ever seen a good gilf oh it's a good gilf great grandmother oh of course i'm really into good gils yes what's that oh great grandmothers write it down uh no go to the act she's but what my point is i've seen so much of that type of stuff and like i feel like anytime you you're in your car and you someone cuts you off and you make a motion or whatever like i've had cars chase my friend i've been in a passenger in a car and a car is chased for a half an hour i've my friend oh you've done that i've chased someone really who has made a rude gesture to you they they were completely wrong and i had some time to kill actually the guy was going in my direction it wasn't really chasing him one direction and uh and uh and uh so i did i followed him for about 30 minutes and i he went through a neighborhood you could tell he's trying to get rid of me right and i followed before before showing you where he lived yes and all i did was say why did you do what you did because he eventually pulled over he did okay he pulled over in the middle of the street and uh not too not too busy in neighborhood technically not pulling over if he does it in the middle of the street well he stopped okay and i pulled next to him and your story is not checking out and he was playing and he waddles he i said why did you do and i can't remember what he did cut me off or give me the finger it's just rude and i followed him and and i asked him like you know i was curious so was it threatening i wasn't yelling at him i was like what just curious you know you shouldn't do that you were in the wrong why why did you and uh he annoyingly recognized me and he's like hey man can i get a picture with him i'm like no i'm trying to discipline you here so and then once i yelled at a guy for uh parking a handicap oh yeah thing and uh i yelled at him he was big i went up to him and said something and he got in my face was clearly not handicapped and he recognized me and he it was a weird thing but he turned out that he had um he had a disease he had he had the right to park there it was some kind of ailment but it wasn't it really couldn't you couldn't see it you couldn't see it on him yeah you did you not look at his car and look for the the i'm very i'm very i'm i'm very um impetuous i those are the that's a good that's a thing that i've always done is is to it bugs me about handicap parking right people do that you see it all the time people it drives me insane and i usually try to say something if they don't have the placard and this person did not have the placard he did have he did have a placard what are you doing well hold on a lot of people have placards and they get it they they scam him so that's their scam he'll leave him alone so what are you you're you see a guy you assume he's scammed a placard did you say that to him did you scam your placard no i just assume that he did because you can you can buy them you can did you apologize to the nice person i did of course i of course i said i'm so sorry i'm just really that bugs me and and he actually said no it's cool that you do did that but you know i have to people come up to me and say that all the time i'm sorry but uh did you take a picture with him or were you like hey man no i'm trying to discipline you but i cared about cameras on their phone yeah boy let's talk about that for a while that's my technology huh my favorite subjects yeah camera phones i yelled at these teenage twins the other day redhead uh jock types hot jock they're like 16-year-old football player types okay god that was like what am i doing why geeella you they were taking pictures videotaping you don't like anyone taking a picture of you by the way i don't think anybody likes a stranger taking a photo of them no if if somebody was taking a picture of your wife let's say my wife and you happened to notice that you were at the counter of a coffee shop and a guy's doing it taking a picture of of kulap why do you got to bring her into this just okay you're because somebody why my cut would just talk about me if someone's doing it you i don't think you would mind i don't mind because i love the spotlight anybody would like to also i love my fans i really appreciate all that you made me laugh i'll remind you about this later but i read something that you wrote made me laugh very hard oh boy but i don't want to put it in the podcast because uh i don't know it's kind of a story okay well we'll uh we'll take a break then and and during that break i want to trick me that you're gonna record

Cool drums, good drum, good drumming on that.

Very good, that's a good version, I like that.

Yeah, and I love how he called out the peppermint and that 's must be a thrill for.

That took us a long time to get that in that song.

Yeah, I mean it should start with that.

Yeah.

It should start.

I mean, it should have seemed like an afterthought.

It should immediately go into that.

Yeah.

You got to run it by corporate, I mean there's a whole thing with the peppers.

Yeah.

Zach, I noticed you weren't singing along during it.

It's, I, what's weird and you didn't even want to admit that there wasn't theme songs.

Zach is afraid to sing.

He's a good singer.

I know, I can't sing.

And also he freestyles each song.

There's always a new song.

Yeah, there's always a new verse.

There's 10 more verses.

There's always a new verse.

Yeah.

You guys have met 10 times?

I've got, we've met 10 times.

Yeah.

But during those sessions, we recorded over 2000 episodes.

Wow.

Yeah.

Starting with, I think we started with the uplift mofo party plan, their first record.

And then, you know, we do a whole.

It's not their first, but go ahead.

OK, we do a whole thing about that.

And they're third record.

It's a third record.

OK, sure.

Since we're when I know more about the peppers than you do.

I was testing you.

And you passed.

Good job.

Thank you so much.

Can I be a pepperman?

We did a whole show on Fight Like A Brave.

We did a whole show on Baseline's.

We did a Baseline show where Flea was heavily featured.

And, you know, in that song, the song I just sang and fre estyle, I mean, I think Flea would really appreciate that.

Because, I mean, you can just feel where the slaps go.

Yeah, yeah.

You could tell, like, in between some of those lyrics where some of those slaps should have gone.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

Exactly.

And kids would say good imitation, but you're not kids.

But hey, just to hear good imitation, that's a thrill.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

Because you're on the right track, at least.

Yeah.

And you'll never be kids.

I'll never be kids, but I mean, what are you going to do?

You're not kids.

You can get the same tattoos.

You can get any of the same tattoos.

I have all of the same tattoos.

Really?

You match him for just body body?

And Flea, yes, Flea's tattoos also.

Tat for tat.

I have Flea's tattoos.

I have Keats tattoos.

Did you get a frosh?

No tattoos.

No frosh.

No tattoos on frosh.

What about Chad?

What about Chad Smith?

Yeah.

Getting you those tats?

Chad's got tats.

Yeah, did you get any of them?

I got his tats.

You got his tats too.

So the three main peppers you got.

I got his tats.

You got their tats.

But did you?

But Frush didn't have any.

Well, I talked to Frush and I was like, do you have some tattoos?

And he was like, no, man.

And I don't know.

Like, I saw their rock and roll.

Do you see them on the rock and roll offense?

Of course.

Well, Frush didn't show up to that.

And I was like, what's the deal?

Well, no, they have a new guitar.

Do you not know they have a new guitarist?

Well, Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was, you know, their guitarist for a while.

Yeah, but he went through a few, but I feel like John would have a new one right now.

Do you not know about this?

Is it Buckethead?

Wait, they've had a new guitarist for two years now.

It seems like...

He's getting with you.

I'm getting with you.

Obviously.

What's his name?

You tell me.

Well, I would, I tell you, I'm not a peppermint.

Well, I asked if I could be an honorary peppermint.

It's a complicated question.

It's a compliment.

So, he has...

John has an allegiance to the...

To Frush.

Oh, gee.

To the OG.

Do you remember...

Do you remember when Flea came up to you at that party and he said, it took you side and he said, I dub thee Zach Gallifley-Nakis.

Do you remember that?

Yeah, that was a great night.

That was a great...

What party was that?

That was Silver Lake...

Yeah, Zach, do you remember when...

It was a ribbon cutting for a soup plantation in Silver Lake?

Yeah.

It sure was.

Great parking.

Yeah, it was fun.

It was fun.

Yeah.

But yeah, so he's got the music schooled at Flea.

Yeah, with Flea does.

Yeah.

He was sick that night.

He had the Flea and then he had to go home.

He did have the Flea.

Kids is actually...

Kids on Man Eyes.

Yeah, I remember it.

That's where his house is.

That's a lot of people don't know.

He's got a mansion right there on Man Eyes.

Yeah, yeah.

He's got so many commercials for his place.

I know.

He wants people to drop by.

It's like he's inviting the paparazzis.

Anyone outside of California and Southern California has no idea what we're talking about.

Speaking of California, the peppers...

The peppers.

Back to California, good.

They're all about...

I feel like Rick Rubin was the first guy who was like, you guys are California.

You guys...

You're the first, dare I say, the first honorary peppermint .

He was the first honorary peppermint because he was like, I 'm going to take what you do put it into the big time.

Does he show up to the meetings or to the podcast recordings?

He...

No, we've been emailing him and Zach, you eventually got in touch with him, right?

He took into a Lakers game?

Yeah.

Courtside?

Yeah.

Courtside Lakes.

Yeah.

So, how was that?

Well, the whole band was there.

Yeah.

Double R was there and...

Double R?

Come on, Scott.

Right.

Double R.

Know your Malibu music icons.

M- Double R?

Come on, man.

Rick Rubin.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Okay.

The aforementioned.

I thought when you said the whole band was there, I thought you meant.

Double R, man.

Okay, sorry.

Anyway.

Great game.

Yeah.

This is when I played for the nuggets.

Okay.

I didn't really go with them.

I mean, you were...

I got them tickets.

You were the ultimate court side.

You were on the court.

Yeah, I was on the court.

Yeah.

And I played for them to...

Did you start that game or did you ride in the bench, though?

That game was...

John Stockton started that game.

He played one season.

I know he's mostly people know from the Utah Jazz, but he went...

And the Bulls, hey, he's great.

Yeah.

Good friend of yours?

Who?

He does?

No, the guy you were talking about, Stockton.

Better friends with Flee, I thank you.

Yeah.

I'm better friends with Keats.

Yeah, he knows.

We're talking about...

Keats is a rooster.

He's a cock.

I like dudes who are like, yeah, man, I'm a fucking...

Flee, Keats is the...

Well, Flee is the heartbeat.

Oh, okay.

Frishiante is the soul.

Right.

Chad Smith is the backbone and Keats is the clown.

You were mentioning all parts of the body before then, and then you said the clown.

So the heart, the soul, the backbone.

It's the clown.

And the clown.

Well, there are big...

The heart, the soul, and the backbone of the clown.

I thought it was implied that I meant of the band, of the band.

And he's a clown.

He's a performing...

You know, so I get along with, you know.

Okay.

So...

You as a clown, and as a person who does all these great characters on our show, which you are eschewing today.

Yeah.

Superform as yourself.

Yeah.

You respond to the clown mentality, I think, you know, more than any other...

Yeah.

I would never call you the backbone of...

I'm a jester.

You're the jester.

No one certainly would ever call you the heart of comedy or ...

I'm Harlequino.

And any project you were involved in say that you had soul or anything like that, or be the backbone or inherently intrinsic to anything.

Well, I mean, you could say that I am the soul, I think Zach Galfelenakis is the heartbeat of the peppermint.

He's being very modest here, and he's not bringing up the fact that he, of all the collaborations he's having with Kedis.

What?

They're working on a new album with a hit single, New Love Ballad about the HOV Lane.

Yeah.

Specific to Southern California.

What?

Yeah.

It goes...

What's the HOV Lane?

The carpool lane?

The carpool lane, yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

You want to hear a little snippet?

I guess so.

I mean, should I lay down any kind of a, like, backbeat or ...

People call me the backbeat of the Comedy Bang Bang podcast .

Yeah.

Well, yeah, lay down a little beat.

Okay.

Yeah.

This is more like, this is a little bit more hip hop.

I got a say.

More hip hop.

Okay.

You know, they're punk funk hip hop.

We all know the pepper sound.

Yeah.

I mean, it goes with the saying.

Yeah.

But so, but, but your collaboration with Kedis is a little more hip hop.

This is a little more hip hop.

Do we want to...

We're grooming the...

We'll get back to that liquor chain in a second.

I wouldn't even have to lay it down.

I have a music school.

I'm so over like no mine's not in silver like where's yours ?

Marina Del Rey it's not as cool.

Wow.

It's affordable.

It's more affordable.

Just for this music school or just because you're a friend.

He'll come out sometimes like he has a jet ski that he takes from UC Santa Barbara.

He's a student at the University of New York.

He went to Hollywood High, so he was a chic.

Did he go to that high school, the Jack Black, and all those great actors went to?

Oh, yeah.

The Cage.

Yes.

He was going to be an actor for a long time, I know.

He always wanted to be an actor.

He was a child actor, wasn't he?

John C. Chontin?

For Chontin?

Yeah, he was a child actor.

I think he was in a lot of commercials, right?

A lot of commercials, he was in different strokes.

For Chontin, he was in those, where's the beef commercials, right?

The ones that came after the famous ones.

He was like, I want to know where the beef is as well.

Yeah, everyone hated him, and just was like, we like the old lady, but.

We love those commercials, and so you wanted, it was like the expectation was there, and then it was horrible.

I remember when they debuted those commercials too, like during halftime of the Super Bowl, and everyone's like , oh boy, the new Where's the Beef commercial.

Yeah.

And that kid just ruined him for it.

No wonder he went into music.

One thing about those commercials too soon, it's like, don 't do it.

It's too soon.

Yeah, too soon.

Like, timing is everything, especially with advertising.

Timing is everything.

The chili peppers.

Timing is everything.

God, this is Scott.

Come on, man.

What were you saying, Zach?

Well, I wanted to, I didn't want to get off the chili peppers because, but John, also another thing that he's into, and you brought it up, so I just thought, John has six Wendy's franchises.

I do.

Yeah.

That he's, uh, John Daley?

Yeah.

Right in front of me has six Wendy's franchises.

Six Wendy's, yeah.

All in, uh, all in like a Toledo, Ohio, like.

And it's suburbs?

Yeah, and it's suburbs, Toledo, Cincinnati, not at suburbs, but, you know, different places in Ohio, yeah.

How do you even get involved in that?

That's crazy.

Well, I own the franchise.

That's the thing.

Wendy's is franchised out to, you know, they have independent franchises.

So I started with one, built it.

It was very successful.

Um, it was, it became a model of, you know, Toledo area.

And then I ended up just, you know, kind of like almost people died who on the Wendy's and I just like, you took it over?

Yeah, just took it over.

You took over, so you took over Wendy's itself.

But it's, yeah, I took over Wendy's is.

Yeah.

So franchises.

They're the same as, you have the same Frosties.

Can I get a quality control at every Wendy's?

Can I ask you a question?

Why, why the square hamburgers?

You know, I've asked Keetis.

Yeah, you left, uh, yeah.

He's in that he's involved.

Yeah.

He's, he's, he's involved heavily in, uh, See, pony up all the, the stardom flow.

You know, think of what you just said.

Okay, sure.

Why the square hamburgers?

You're talking about the square hamburgers.

You brought them up.

So that's what we want.

And that's what Keetis, Keetis is the showman.

He's the clown.

He's the cock.

Does he ever rap about the square hamburgers?

Oh, of course.

I mean, can you, if there was a beat, I'd show you, but I know you, you're no kids, but we could put down a beat here and we could, let's tell you what, let's go, let's go to break hearing about the square hamb urger rap.

Okay.

All right, here we go.

Oh, yeah.

Nothing to keep down, down, when it's done, square hamburg ers and where it's at.

You can't eat it until you're fat.

Square hamburgers is where it's at.

You can't eat it until you're fat on your tomatoes and no bond.

There's a lot of bad hamburgers on the run.

Where they going, McDonald's town.

They're gonna go with the clown is brown.

Brown clown.

We're going to McDonald's town?

Brown clown.

Why would they mention McDonald's?

I don't know, there's a brown clown.

He likes his hamburgers, brown brown.

Brown McDonald is a dumb clown.

He likes his hamburgers, brown man.

My name is Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

We're going to have a French accent.

You got to make the burger square and the size of a burger.

There's twice a McDonald's size.

It's a corner, pound with fries.

Man.

I don't know.

All right.

We'll come right back.

We'll edit that down.

Do not edit.

We'll touch that.

That's it.

We'll be right back.

Neil Campbell will be joining us after this break.

We'll be right back a little company.

Bye bye.

Square hamburgers are back.

It's at brown.

You know, no, no, no, no, no.

I never stopped it.

Driving down the four row five.

Out to the beach, California.

L.A. to Ventura County.

BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM.

Wow.

BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM.

You were freestyling during that entire break.

That's so crazy.

Yeah.

Welcome back to the show.

This is Comedy Bank Banging.

A few things about that song, by the way.

I think it's a little bit of a little bit of a joke.

I think it's a little bit of a joke.

What do you mean by that when you say a hybrid goose man?

Is it Ryan Gosling?

Well, we haven't cast it yet.

Right now it just exists on the page.

Okay, so a part goose, part man.

Yes, exactly.

I mean, I can get into this.

Okay, yeah.

Because right now you just know the story.

But you can't just have a story.

You're putting together a play.

You've got to have great characters.

Sure, sure.

You know, Blanche Dubois.

It doesn't even have an old salesman like Willie Lohman.

He mentioned the salesman.

He got hung up on this salesman guy.

I haven't noticed.

Okay.

But you know what it would have?

A vampire who works as a hitman for the Yakuza?

Okay.

I don't know.

That's what's important to me in this modern day and age.

So that's in your play about a hybrid goose man.

Yes.

You have another character that's a vampire who's a hitman.

Who's a hitman for the Yakuza?

Well, he's on the run and that's who's chasing him.

Oh, the goose man.

The goose man's on the run.

With oil slick 2.0.

Oh, okay.

Okay, great.

And you know, my play, it may not have the acerbic word play of who's afraid of Virginia wolf, but it does have snake guns.

Snake guns.

Those are guns that shoot snakes.

They have replaced regular guns in this dystopian future society.

Oh, cause bullets were too effective or they were too effective.

Let's just say the government changed their mind about the second amendment.

Oh, okay.

Sorry to get political here.

So go on snake guns.

They shoot snakes at you and I guess the snakes are propelled towards the characters and then bite the people.

Yes, exactly.

Are these bullet sized snakes or are they full sized snakes ?

They're a great question.

That was a great question.

They are full sized.

Sure.

It's like rifle.

How do they fit into the gun or is it like long rifles?

Okay.

Like revolutionary war style.

Okay.

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

Snake money.

The musket is the snake's natural enemy on the wild.

Oh, I never thought about that.

That's what that song Musket Love is all about.

Yeah.

Okay.

And you know, plays spectacle.

That's an important part of a play.

Oh, yeah.

You have to.

Yeah.

But you know, my play, it doesn't have a falling chandelier .

Like the Phantom with our good friend at the show, Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Exactly.

It does have a sequence where oil slick 2.0 does a chore ographed dance with a gang of Hispanic teenagers.

And then because of that, they help him win his next fight.

Hmm.

I don't know.

That's interesting.

I don't know.

That feels a little bit more truthful to me than dusting off some old classic like death of a salesman.

Wow.

You really don't like death of a salesman.

It's a classic.

It's one of my favorites.

Zack, what do you think about this?

Does this sound like a juicy role that maybe you want?

I don't know.

There's so many.

I know.

The vampire, the oil slick.

The vampire.

The half goose.

Half goose half man.

Yes.

Which half is which, by the way?

It's one half of the double helix is goose.

The other half of the double helix is me.

So it's all just man.

It's just inherent in his DNA.

What's he look like more?

Howard the duck.

So he looks exactly like Howard the duck.

Yes.

Does he talk like him too?

I suppose that's what the stage directions say.

Is he a duck?

Or goose?

No.

Oh, he looks like Howard the duck.

Yeah, he's a goose.

Okay.

Interesting.

No, I see that.

Interesting.

All right.

Keep going.

Okay.

The name of the play is it.

Does it have a name yet?

Yeah.

Okay.

Quackers feather beaks cuckoo caper.

All right.

I don't know.

To me, it sounds like you could just.

King Lear, the cherry orchard.

Sure.

Quackers feather beaks cuckoo caper.

It fits right in.

It does.

Yeah.

The long lineage in tradition of it kind of reminds me of uplift mofo party play.

It really does.

It's a mouthful, but it loves it.

I wonder if kids could ever rap.

Maybe he could do the music for this show.

For the play?

For the play.

Yeah.

You know how a lot of musicians like Branford Marsalis, no, or.

I love Branford Marsalis.

I love Branford.

I can't remember.

One of those guys, they started doing music for plays.

No.

Yeah.

Branford sacks, whitens Trump tea trumpet.

Man, that might be.

Would you be open to that at all?

I'd love that.

I'm, um, theater's all about collaboration.

What's the title again?

Quackers feather beaks cuckoo caper.

What would that, what would that sound like?

I think he'd skid rap his mind around that.

Let's take a, let's hear a little bit of that.

I love this.

Hey, here we go.

So, do you need, do you need to look at the, or do you remember it?

I remember that.

No.

Quackers feather beaks cuckoo caper.

I'm a motherfucking really cool guy.

Fucking feather beaks cuckoo caper.

Specta cool, but don't focus on oil slick is a fucking guy that my friends with.

Let me start over.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

I think I should start over.

I don't think I really did it justice.

Yeah.

Say the name of the thing again.

Flackers feather beaks cuckoo caper.

I'm a motherfucking really cool guy.

What's the pool of wet swimming?

Oh!

Let's get some ducks.

Look like I'm with the duck.

I'm on the fucks and duck.

I'm a fucking guy that likes to fuck people in costumes.

A comic con.

A stick my dick out of a hole in a costume.

Does that work?

I do have something like that.

I don't know if you like, if that, yeah.

Does that encapsulate the theme?

I thought it started pretty great.

That's cool.

I will say the play set in this dystopian future society has all these characters.

I'm a song where, I don't know, 20 seconds in it just becomes Anthony Keith's talking about his own life.

Well, I wasn't trying to answer any questions.

I just don't know.

It would be tough to see how that would fit.

I was trying to leave the audience.

I know I do challenging stuff.

I understand.

I'm not going to be a fan of the characters at the end.

But there's hope.

It started well, you say.

It started well.

So with how the play, you mentioned a couple of characters that Anthony Keith has talked about.

See, that's what I thought.

I thought it started to eat up there.

That's where I thought it started to really go.

He did it, he had AIDS.

Yeah, well, in the middle of that, during that time, as well as an admission of not getting good grades, as I recall.

Right.

I didn't get good grades.

Had nothing to do with getting AIDS.

No, he had.

It was almost like.

He got AIDS after the grades.

I'm sure tumbled.

Yeah.

It probably maybe led.

The grades led to, you know, maybe the terrible situation there.

Before he had AIDS, he had R-H-C-P.

That's right.

Well, what we're saying is education.

Educate yourselves out there, kids, because, you know, there's a lot of sticky situations you can get into.

If you feel like it works, it's random.

Yeah.

Where are some condoms?

Put a rubber on that.

Put a jimmy on that is what we're trying to say.

Yeah.

Anything else about this play?

No, I mean, that's about it.

It's just, you know, most plays are about characters that are searching for something, you know, a truth, acceptance, trying to make a big sale.

Jeez.

I don't know.

Did you see death of a salesman?

No.

I've seen the cover of the published play.

The book, the book jacket.

The book jacket.

Yeah, with the silhouette of a man holding a case.

Yeah.

But you hate it for some reason.

I guess I would say that.

Yes.

What?

Did you ever have anything in your life where your parents didn't take you to it when they promised they would or something?

Um, no, I just saw the book jacket yesterday.

You saw it yesterday because you were looking through plays to try to get some ideas.

It's inspired that.

Yeah, that's what I did.

And all you were doing was looking at the book, the dust jackets and saying, oh, that seems like it would be a good play.

Yes.

And then that one just seemed like- You infuriated me.

I don't know what it would be about.

Life is full of contradictions.

Yeah.

Well, if you see Neil driving, what kind of car do you drive?

Um, Humvee.

If you see Neil driving a Humvee, with that license plate, life is full of contradictions.

Any numbers in that or just as life is full of contradictions?

The eye in life is a one.

Okay, good.

Then be sure to- what would you suggest?

Beep at you, pull you over, just do what's acted, which is follow you around in a super-proof for half an hour.

Yeah, blow me kisses, anything.

Yeah, okay, good.

But so, yeah, I mean, that's about it.

It's also- it is eight hours long.

It's like Nicholas Nickel Bay.

How far along are you in riding this, by the way?

Um, I guess I basically ride at the rate at which it would take place.

So, I've ridden for four hours.

Mm-hmm.

At this point, it's four hours long.

Really?

So, you're able to ride in real time.

Yeah.

Wow, that's so crazy.

I use that machine Stevie Wonder uses when he writes an email.

Wow.

Just I dictate in it.

You just talk it right- oh, okay.

Exactly.

Well, I gotta read this play.

Where can people read it?

It's- it's still just on my hard drive of my Smith Corona.

Of your Smith Corona, right?

Yep.

Yeah.

I put it on a thumb drive.

Okay.

So, yeah, I'm trying to imagine your setup because you read into that machine that Stevie Wonder has.

Isn't that it types?

I like to bring my words to the keys.

Oh, okay.

And it types it out.

Crazy, man.

Zach, have you ever heard of anything like this?

It does sound crazy.

I'm astonished by it all.

Yeah.

In the process.

A real artist here.

You know what I mean?

Remind me again what the play is called.

Quackers, feather, beaks, cuckoo, caper.

Speaking of Stevie Wonder, one of the best covers, chili peppers, covers of all time.

Mm-hmm.

Which one?

Ribbon in the sky.

Yeah.

Ribbon in the sky.

Yeah.

Oh, love.

Sir Psycho Sexy also.

Yeah.

Great.

So psycho sexy.

That is me.

Yeah.

I love that.

Yeah.

Well, guys, I think we're just about at the end of the show .

We just have one last thing.

And that is, of course, a little something that we call plugs.

Robot hot and hot and hot and hot and hot and hot.

Hi, this is Scott, and we're reminding you to invite your Wolf merchandise and products, and also to plug your latest show cancers and some of your albums or your movies and your new TV shows. What have you and let me check out campaign. I have season one's over, but hopefully we'll pick up for season two.

I just got a document that came hot and saucer.

Okay, thank you.

Hi, this is Scott, and we're reminding you to invite your Wolf merchandise and products, and also to plug your latest show cancers and some of your albums or your movies and these shows. What have you and let me check out campaign. I have season one.

Bombs over back to head.

It just cuts off. We didn't cut it off. It just cuts off like that.

Thank you so much to Ethan breach for that one. That is called plug song Ethan. Thank you so much. If you have a plugs theme.

That's a really good.

It's got to be the that's the thing. If you have a plug theme, it has to be that good now in order to go in the show.

Yeah.

Okay, you can't just toss it off.

If you've written a plug theme and it's not that good, back to your old Stevie Wonder machine, my dear friend.

Back to the lab, fam.

Did you just say you just you can't toss it off?

Yeah, you can't toss it off.

Yeah.

Um, why?

Is that an expression that you use for you can't just wing it?

Yeah, exactly.

Can't just toss it off. Yeah.

I'll toss it off.

All right.

Good.

At one point, Quacker says, I don't got a plan.

I'm just going to wing it.

Wow.

That's cool.

He fights the vampire.

That's like the last two hours.

I can see.

Oh, you haven't gotten there yet though?

I can see Flee in that role.

Take a note.

Yeah.

Does, uh, he's great in point break.

Yeah.

Is it a man with a goose head or is it, uh, it's an old Howard that not costing my found?

Yeah.

Where'd you find it?

A costume shop.

Hmm.

How much did you buy for?

I stole it.

I just want to say that that Ryan Gosling joke, I made.

I understood.

Really brilliant.

I got it.

Wait.

Maybe I'm Ryan here.

So is Ryan Gosling like Ryan Goose?

When I just answered honestly, we haven't reached casting yet.

Yeah.

I thought that was pretty good.

He can't.

He's good.

He's goose-gossage.

Would he be, you know who that is?

Oh yeah.

Yeah.

What about, there is a relief pitcher in it.

So what about Lewis Goose at Junior?

Senior maybe I would go in.

How about Goose from Top Gun?

Mm hmm.

How about Louis?

The dead body.

Huey Louis and the goose.

How about Wesell Snipes as a bear?

No, bear for God.

And it sank in.

These are all great ideas.

I should have brought you guys in for a brainstorming session before I started writing.

Yeah.

I mean, you know, because you could write for the actual actor, you know what I mean?

That's true.

Instead of just whatever.

I'll probably do a big rewrite once we have it cast.

Wait.

How about Celebrity Apprentice?

I don't know how to...

Well, it's Donald Goose and he fired.

Oh, it's a parody.

You're fired.

Yeah.

You're quacked.

Yeah.

I don't know.

You're quacked up.

I was like an internet video idea.

Yeah, I'll die.

I'll call Vimeo.

Maybe you should abandon this play and just do internet videos.

Hm.

I'm not very good at those.

Well, I got it to the play.

All right.

Well, what are we plugging here, by the way?

By the way, if you have a plug theme, then go to earwolf.

com and put in the appropriate message boards.

Thank you, Ethan, for that one.

What are we plugging?

Zach, what do you have?

You're doing the Hangover 3 coming out in May.

Great.

Anything else?

That Brody Stevens show, I can plug that.

Brody Stevens, if you haven't been to HBO Go yet, check out Brody Stevens and JoyIt.

That's really, I enjoyed it.

I did exactly what the title commanded me to.

And I said, yes, master.

And I turned it on.

Um, John, what do you have to plug?

I'm taking over John Daly, the golfer's online personality.

My website is John Daly is John Daly.

That's J-O-N, Daly is J-O-H-N, Daly.

And Daly is D-L.

D-A-L-Y.

Yeah.

And John Daly is JohnDaley.com.

And go there and check out my pictures and try and prolifer ate them into the internet so I can take back the name John Daly from.

That guy, though, I want to reach out to him with all love in my heart.

I want to do a project with you, man.

You got to do a project with you.

You keyed.

Got to do a week, he's.

Also, while I want to plug the Pepper Cast, which is coming to Daly podcast, seven days a week.

And...

Twice on Sundays, too.

That's what's really great.

Twice on Sundays, just like cheering perfs.

We go, Zach and I actually go to church, do we do the cast, then we go to church again, then we do the cast.

Interesting that you mentioned Louis Gossett, Jr. who's an iron eagle.

Now we're talking about a golfer who uses irons.

And we just got done talking about geese, another bird.

And Jack Irons was the old drummer of the chili peppers.

Damn.

This is crazy.

You're a pepperman, man.

I am, man.

Alright, so Neil, do you have anything else to plug here?

You can see me do improv every Thursday at 11 p.m. at the UCB Theater in Los Angeles with my group last day of school.

Okay.

I'll play.

It's Cinely, bro.

I want to thank Kurt Braun.

Kurt Braun, thank you so much.

You gave $100 this.

You donated $100 this CBB.

Thank you so much, Kurt.

We have something special coming to you.

What else?

Paul of Tonkin, do you want to plug anything?

Yeah, just like the idea of me and comedy that I do.

Just always doing it.

Yeah.

And I think I'm pretty funny.

You're not bad.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

That's why we let you plug things at the end of our show.

Maybe other people agree that I'm not that bad.

Yeah.

For your whole life.

Good stuff.

Great.

No, we haven't met, but thank you.

Yeah.

Oh, hey, I'm John Daly.

I host the Pepper Cast.

We have met.

Zach.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Zach, who?

Gullifley.

NACUS.

Great.

Well, that's been your podcast.

Yes.

That's been our show.

I want to thank our guests.

Thank you, Neil, for debuting that.

That's going to be exciting.

Please come back and read it for the whole eight hours on the show.

Where will that be put on?

Yeah, where's it going to be put on?

I'm hoping for the Wintergarden and the Amundsen.

It's not that sad.

Even with zero context that really amused me.

John, thank you so much.

Always great to see you.

Absolutely.

We'll see you.

And Zach, thank you so much.

Thanks for having me on.

My pleasure.

And Paul, nice to see you again.

Scott, it's always a pleasure.

Did you just come in for a plug?

Yeah.

See you later, Paul.

Is that not cool?

Bye, guys.

All right, we'll see you next week.

Thanks.

Bye.
