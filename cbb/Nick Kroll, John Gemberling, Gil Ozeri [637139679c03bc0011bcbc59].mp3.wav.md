♪♪♪ I'm not boycotting Disney theme parks, I'm epicotting them.

Welcome to Comedy Banging Bang.

Thank you to Elvis Cholestarall, Stello for that catchphrase submission, and aka Sasha O'Concent on Twitter.

And welcome to Comedy Banging. Happy Navi doggy to you.

Welcome to the show. We have a great one.

Coming up a little later, we have someone with a supernatural conundrum and also someone with a unique aspect to them.

That is a little later on the show, but boy, my name is Scott Ocherman, first of all, and let's get to our guest of honor.

Why are we even waiting? Welcome to the show.

If you've never heard of before, let's just jump right in.

He is the writer and creator and star of the Netflix animated For Adults.

Television show, Big Mouth.

He also is the stand-up comedian behind the recent Netflix comedy special, Little Big Boy.

Please welcome Nick Kroll.

Thank you.

Our old friend, Nick Kroll.

I love where you're putting accents on this emphasis.

Yeah, on the last word.

Do you usually say Big Mouth?

Big Mouth. Big Mouth.

Yeah.

It's to, so people pay attention to the mouths on the show, which I think are, those are the first things that the animators draw, right?

They start from the mouth and then work out.

Work outwards.

And I don't think it's just for adults, frankly.

I think we're far enough.

You think it's far enough? It's for old people.

The very old people.

The very old people who become like babies.

Sure, yeah.

The famous saying.

The Circle of Life.

You change people's diapers when they're young, up to about...

Fuck man, has anybody ever thought this before?

I don't think so, man.

Fuck dude.

We're breaking new ground in comedy here.

Dude, man!

I'm happy to be here.

Very small.

So happy to have you.

It has been a while.

And, I mean, maybe two seasons even.

At least.

Yeah, and I've been...

Autumn and summer.

Autumn, it's been...

Fuck.

Has it been both autumn and summer?

What if television seasons were every season?

So you had to do four a year.

Dude, yeah.

Big mouth is coming up this autumn.

And winter.

And summer.

And I guess we're now, we now owe them summer and I guess whatever they're...

I guess it's called...

I know it in Spanish as Primavera.

Primavera?

Oh, is that really what Primavera means?

Yeah, and that's how I pronounce it.

Primavera.

I've had a pasta Primavera.

Does that mean like a selection of spring vegetables?

Yeah, that's like a 1980s pasta.

It's a pasta for a cafe, Cordial.

What is this restaurant roundup?

No, let's get back to you.

Nick, you are...

You've been on since the early days of the show, back of the Indy 1013 One Days.

You were in there a lot.

Ew, gato.

That's right.

And that will be the last you clear of that.

You're finally putting the nail in your coffin?

Regarding that?

Wow, but I do remember that.

Let's say goodbye, a fun farewell, dude.

A fun farewell.

Yeah, I remember those very, very, very clearly.

Juan chamon.

Juan chamon, you did...

Yeah, you did Chupacabro, is it?

Yes.

Yeah.

And now here we are.

Yeah.

Almost...

Smashcut 2.

Smashcut to almost 40 seasons later.

Actually, it's 52 seasons or so.

Wow.

10, you believe it.

Wow.

14 years.

I can.

I've listened to every episode in its entirety of your show.

That is so flattering.

Amazing.

Multiple times.

Wow.

How do you have time?

I mean, you do so many TV shows.

Well, because about every six months I have a psychotic break.

Oh, okay.

Good.

And I leave and I go to...

You just associate...

Yes, do you know Chatsworth?

Do you know where Chatsworth is?

Of course.

It's in the valley.

Of course, yeah.

I'll go there and I'll get a one bedroom, I'll leave my family, and I'll just do a bang.

Just rip through...

Whatever happened to previous six months?

I smoke just cartons of cigarettes.

Yeah.

Chester Fields.

That's so flattering.

Thank you so much.

Do they make half bedrooms?

They do.

We're only half a bedroom.

I saw...

I do saw a mattress and half and put it in the bathroom.

Has a magic trick, then.

Yeah.

And I use it as a kitchen.

Do you have any weird hobbies like when, you know, David Wayne has like 47 weird hobbies?

Yes.

And I have no hobbies.

I have none.

I literally know hobbies.

Really?

So what do you do with your time?

You wake up.

I wake up.

I sleep as late...

Let's start there.

I sleep as literally as late as possible for whatever the first thing I have to do.

So if you have a nine o'clock appointment.

I am waking at...

If I have a nine o'clock appointment and I'm not responsible for my child, I will wake up at like 8.35.

And I've got like 20 minutes.

I mean, if I have to drive somewhere, I have to drive somewhere.

Okay.

Let's add another 10 on.

Okay.

It's a famous thing about LA.

Everything is 10 minutes.

Of course.

Whether you drive in a studio city or you're cooking an egg, everything is 10 minutes.

So I'll do that.

But I will wake up or if I have to wake up for my son, that will be the literal last possible minute where I believe he will teeter.

Like five minutes before.

Yes.

Not even.

I will.

If he wakes up, I hear him crying.

I wait as long as I can for his cries.

It will.

He's stopped.

He will not stop.

Damn it.

And how long can I do it before he teeters on the edge of a meltdown?

Right.

I then will go.

Not literally.

I will wipe water on my eye.

He's not literally melting.

No, no, he's not literally melting.

That can happen.

Weirdly our, his crib is a toaster.

Oh, okay.

Interesting.

So he just pops up when he's ready for that.

Yes, exactly.

We got to give him control of that though.

So yeah.

And then, but yeah, I, so I, and then I, my day is whatever things I have to do.

Why don't we start talking about this?

Uh, hobbies.

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

So you work and.

You know what it is?

My hobby is watching David Wayne do his hobbies on the internet.

Yeah.

He's amazing at them.

I, I, he, he is an idle hand.

He can draw.

I've seen do magic.

Yes.

He can edit his own videos.

Edit his own videos.

He directs somehow he has a Hollywood career, although.

Yes.

I don't know how he has time for that with everything else.

I don't, I, I just think certain people are, are you a hobby person?

I have my hobbies.

Yeah.

You know what?

I have one hobby.

I have a hobby lobbies lobby.

Good.

I.

The hobbies of the hobby lobby.

You've lobbied.

Yes.

The, the people in Washington who lobby on behalf of Hobby Lobby.

Yeah.

Use for their hobbies.

For their, for their political takes.

Right.

That is my hobby.

Right.

Wow.

Um, I, that's so interesting that you, and you've just never had anything you do with your free time.

I really, I, then just obviously you work out constantly.

I work out.

I mean, yes, I guess, but I don't think of that as a hobby.

I think.

No one has ever seen you below the neck.

Yes.

I mean, any of your projects you, you are.

Absolutely ripped with veins everywhere.

Yeah.

I'm a vein filled.

And you have your main vein, which is right.

Oh, everyone's a while.

Oh, that's a hobby.

Everyone's a while.

I will.

That's God's video.

I will drain the main vein.

Oh, really?

When you say drain, you just pee?

Yes.

That's your hobby.

I remove the catheter that I have in my penis.

Cause I've worked out so much.

My pro, my prostate.

Yeah.

My prostate looks like a chicken parm set.

So I have to take it elsewhere.

Yeah, understandable.

So I drain that.

So you've just never done anything even when you were a kid.

Not really.

I mean, I played sports for a while.

Which sports?

I played baseball.

I played basketball.

America's pastime.

And still going.

Going.

Go.

Right into a child's face.

Oh, lawsuit.

Here it comes.

I will watch playoff sports.

That's a hobby.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, definitely watching sports as a hobby.

But I don't really do during the regular season.

Yeah.

Why bother?

I need stakes.

That's the thing.

There's way too many teams.

And what you're going to watch them whittle it down to a manageable amount.

So like start with the manageable amount.

Yeah, I watched the last 10 minutes.

The Miss Universe competition.

Sure.

What about it?

I just need to know when there's real stakes.

Yeah, exactly.

And also the other thing is only watch the last five minutes of those games.

The playoff games.

Kind of.

Because really the first three hours doesn't matter.

It's all bullshit leading up to this final moment.

Yeah, you saved so much time.

And weirdly what I'm always rooting for is like a 16 point differential.

Like a game that really sort of peters out.

Yeah, just like slowly comes to a point.

Like not so fun that it's an absolute blowout.

No one even uses their timeouts.

You know, yeah, they're just like sort of half-assing it through the end of the game.

Yeah.

That's what I'm looking for.

Like a game five, like a boring world series, like a game five.

Right.

Like it's going to be decided the next game.

Yeah, it's like eight to three.

Yeah, but I, but I, but I really, I'm investing all my money in the sport of baseball.

Really?

The next big thing.

Yeah, no, it's coming back.

Definitely.

Well, now here's what they're doing.

They're putting a pitch clock on to make it shorter because right now the games are approximately seven, seven and a half hours a piece.

Yeah.

That seventh inning stretch which takes about an hour.

Yeah.

All the players get like Jersey Mike's delivered and they just roll through getting it Mike's way.

We got to get people want to be at that stadium and we got a self-cracker Jack's word.

Right.

So they're trying to make it a little bit shorter in order to, to liven it up and also umpse aren't going to be a thing.

Is this what I heard?

Yeah, umpse are just going to be a noise.

Really?

So computers making a noise?

Who's going to record that?

Uh, mailer Damon probably.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Let's hear some examples of out strike.

I track three.

Let's get struck three here.

Right.

We're rolling.

They're going to put, we're rolling in.

Ump.

We're just going to say ump.

Ump.

And that means it's a strikeout.

Oh, okay.

So three umpse is a strikeout.

Yeah.

Three umpse is a strikeout.

Interesting.

This is because mailer David doesn't want to record much more than just saying, oh, yeah.

He doesn't.

No, he's just the engineer.

He's not, he's not involved.

He's not talent.

Got it.

He's the engineer.

And I will say one of the owners of the, one of the owners of the New York Mets.

Really?

Yes, me and Steve Coon.

No, aren't you?

Yeah.

Aren't you from, are you from the New York area?

You are.

I'm originally from the New York area.

Aren't you the heir of the, uh, the famous detective agency?

I am the heir to the famous, yes.

What are they called again?

Who's the other one called?

The ones who defended money on the railroads.

Oh, yeah.

The Pinkerton's.

Aren't you the heir to the Pinkerton's?

I am mailer David heir to the Pinkerton's fortune.

I was sold to Norton Antivirus.

They own you now.

They own the rights to me.

Is this what I once sounded like?

I'm not sure.

Have you used this voice in, in your other show at that point?

All of my voices are three different ingredients.

Put together in various forms.

Classy.

This one has classy.

This is classy.

It's got a.

This is.

Yeah.

And this is gravitas.

Classy gravitas sandy.

Okay.

Now let's hear classy gravitas in what's one of your other qualities for your other voices.

Ah, timid.

Okay.

Classy gravitas timid.

Lou.

Yeah.

Too timid.

I barely wanted to talk on Mike.

Too much timid.

Let's turn down the Tim.

Let's go through all of the voices you do on your show.

Oh.

Okay.

Who's the main guy?

Nick.

Nick is the main guy.

That doesn't seem right.

Are you sure?

I mean, not, not according to people's favorite characters.

Who's the favorite characters?

I would say, uh, people like Lola a lot right now.

Lola.

Oh, fogly old skull.

Oh, that's one that you do.

Okay.

So great.

So you've seen every episode.

Look, I walk through the room when it's on.

So I've seen quite a few.

So what silently walks stomping through a room.

Stomping.

I'm just trying to get a few minutes to enjoy.

A little bit of joy.

I have a friends program and I stomp through.

When are we watching what I want?

When am I going to?

When are we turning on some sort of comic book thing?

What are the qualities of this voice?

You have Lola has a real roller coaster.

Opps and downs.

Opps and then it goes down almost like, let's say you could get his name is this.

He's just keeping me, but you might know him as Marty shorts.

Big boy character.

Oh, yes, of course.

Based on the big boy character.

Jimmy.

Oh, yeah.

Jimin.

Yeah, a little Jimin.

Yes.

Oh, yes.

Yeah.

And that's more class.

He's up here.

Yeah.

I love that when a character has two different voices.

You know what I mean?

That's exactly what it looks like.

Because Jimin.

He starts to be here.

And then goes down here.

And then P.E. has the, you know, the kind of like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

And then goes, that's great when a character has two separate voices.

It doesn't bore him to have two separate voices.

He goes, yes.

What does he sound like again?

My way.

Do I have that right?

I think so.

Big mouth.

Speaking of P.E. Herman, I went and saw, it's not a big deal.

Oh, wow.

But I saw a concert this weekend live at the Hollywood Bowl.

The Hollywood Bowl.

So Danny Elfman at the Hollywood Bowl.

Yes, I heard that was great.

It was.

How was it?

Fascinating.

My friend played drums.

Your friend plays drums for him?

Yes.

Wow.

It was fascinating.

It was not what I was expecting.

I saw the Coachella set, so maybe it's what I was expecting.

So you saw that, yes.

Yes.

You could have expected what you saw.

Right.

What did you think?

Let's talk about it.

I saw, so I'm, I don't, again, I have no hobbies.

I don't know anything about anyone.

I know Danny Elfman as somebody who like wrote music for a lot of movies.

In my mind, that also included like Disney movies.

Right.

Like, and then I was like, oh, right.

I think maybe Allison Wonderland is one of the Disney movies.

Yes.

And all the, it's all Jim Bird and stuff.

And I'm there before Christmas.

It's nightmare before Christmas.

Beetlejuice.

Scissor hands.

Edwards scissor hands.

Is that how you pronounce it?

It might be Skizz, or hands?

Is it Edwards sugar raw sand?

Sugar raw?

Sugar raw.

Cigar raw.

Cigar raw hands.

Okay.

So, so, so I was not expecting, but I knew what he looked like.

This is a good start.

If you go see someone in concert and you could identify them when they walk on stage, you're like halfway there.

So, yes.

I had the problem when I saw a little wane.

Sure.

Of course.

Like which of these guys is this?

I thought it was a little wane Newton.

You have you have a little bit of a hint with the little part.

Yes.

So, whoever's the smallest person on stage.

Sometimes it's ironic.

Yeah, that's true.

Sometimes there's also a puppet on stage and you're like, that's it.

Yes.

Like no.

That's not it.

It's the human being.

That's not it.

So, and thankfully a concert would usually have someone coming around and going, that's not it.

That's, that's, and I, so I, because I touched my, what I thought was my belly button.

It was my penis.

And so when someone came by it said that's not it.

And that's not my belly button.

I was shamed in front of 18,000 Danny Elfman fans.

Wow.

Yeah, they put the camera on me and everything.

Really?

So, I, I was not expecting it to be, he's ripped.

He's ripped.

He's, he's 69 years old.

Oh, I love that.

Yeah.

And he's got red, like red hair.

Uh huh.

There's a, yeah.

And, and, and he's, and his, the music he plays like his band or the music he's playing is like kind of, like, I don't know, like nine inch nails ish.

Yes.

Well, it's, it's split into, the concert was split into three different parts.

Yes.

He would alternate between Oingo Boingosons.

Yes.

His modern music, his new album, which is kind of a industrial-ish album.

And then his, uh, concert, his, uh, film scores.

Yes.

It's like, it's like if he and Trent Reznor, like, crossed.

Yeah.

And, and like, met it, saw each other on the street and we were like, what's up?

Huh.

And they were like, looked at each other and be like, like, I don't know.

I do what you do.

You do what I do.

Do you, do you do what I do?

Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you do this?

Does any of you, do you, do you?

How are we, can we wipe do on the, on the wall like we're babies?

Do you do this?

Do you do it?

And then that's the composition.

Those are the sheet notes for the music.

That's what we do.

Is that what we do?

Is that like the monkeys doing the typewriter segull?

Like, eventually one of them will write came later.

Yeah.

Eventually one of them will write the, all the music to social network.

Right.

Is that how Resiner writes?

Resiner, is that a?

Yeah, Resiner and Al, because Ross.

I'm doing a Resiner writing residency.

Oh, Resiner, it's a Resiner.

Resiner, didn't see you.

So wait, so how did you enjoy it though?

It was not what you expected.

I enjoyed it as, as my wife said, it's, it was nice to see someone in their full expression.

Danny, really great that you love what you're doing.

Is how I felt as a spectator as, but there were 18,000 people there who were having the time of their weird lives.

Yes.

I mean, I loved the Coachella set because I, you know, I was a huge.

You have a, you have a, yes.

Oh, wow.

See, I have no idea what I go.

I just know when I go as the noise, when I say I want to go to the mattress.

Like the Godfather style.

You want to go to the mattress?

I want to go to the mattress.

I do explain who Oingo Boingo was though to someone who is much younger.

Then I, and it was so embarrassing.

It was a dog.

Hello.

Can I bet you first?

Let me explain who Oingo Boingo is.

They, they said to me, what was your first concert?

And I said, Oingo Boingo.

And they said, I don't, is that fake?

Are you joking with me?

I had to explain it.

I was like grasping at straws.

Like, do you know who Danny Elfman is?

No.

Yeah.

See, this all sounds like literally like a, a spin off podcast that you do called Oingo Boingo.

And it's like you and Mike Hanford.

That's, that's what I imagine.

But I think the older you get, the more anything that you enjoyed as a kid just seems like gobbledygook to, to a younger generation.

Yes.

That's how I feel about like American gladiators.

Right.

You're really into them.

Nitro.

The rest is shooting tennis balls of people.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

Did you watch that tag game show?

I watched the movie.

I watched the movie tag.

A pre-night.

In between bang bang episodes.

No, that's when I'm on my medication is I'm watching tag every night.

Oh, God.

When I go off, I go to...

When you lose interest in tag, you know something's going down.

It's time to turn on bang bang.

You think you start to feel crackly.

Right, exactly.

Otherwise, but I'm watching tag every night.

Nick, tell us about Big Mouth.

This season six, if I had to guess?

This is season six.

If you had to guess.

And what's...

What's the...

Are they growing older?

They're growing older at a rapid rate.

They're all in their late 70s.

What?

I read a headline the other day that said, Nick Croll hopes his characters will go to high school or something like that.

Yeah.

Is that something?

Isn't that a dream for all of us?

Because they're all our babies, right?

See, we want to see them get to high school.

We want to see them graduate.

Because once those kids get to high school, clean my hands.

Yeah.

Go ahead.

The New Dealer comes in.

Yes, the New Dealer comes in just as they're building momentum.

They deal them crippling anxiety.

And there it goes.

That's high school, baby.

But that is the plan is to be done with the kids.

Be done with my child when he gets nice.

Yeah.

Well, I mean, 18 as well.

Are you legally obligated even if...

If you homeschool them, you get that GED at 14.

They're at the house.

Good to know.

This is good as a diploma.

This is great.

I'm getting good tips for you.

Yeah, this is the way it works.

So, but the kids, I don't know, it's so not up to me.

What isn't?

The show?

Yeah, how long the show goes.

Oh, what does that mean?

You could quit today.

It means it's God's plan.

What can I pay you to quit today?

To get you out of this car seat.

Here's how much I hate the show.

Here's how much I want the show to be gone.

Every penny I've made, Nick, I will pay you to not put pen to paper.

I will pay you.

Which is how we write the show.

Yeah, yellow legal pads.

That's great.

Like stand-ups that I don't listen to.

Are you allowed to write things that aren't like legal?

Yes, on legal paper.

Yeah.

You can write regal.

You can write regal things.

Regal paper.

You know, it's a fountain pen.

It's a scroll.

Sure, of course.

It's a thing.

I don't trust myself.

I'm not going to do that.

I'm not going to do magic for us.

Oh, okay.

If it's a party at your house.

Where's the baby?

You know, the baby is a trick.

It's not a magic trick.

She just lost the baby.

I don't know.

Either way.

I was fucking wild, dude.

We went to a party and it was one of the first times I had seen a magician in a real, like, sort of bigger space, like, blow it.

How big is this?

Like, like, you failed as a trick?

I kept going like this.

That's pretty close.

You know, like, that was all I was like, that was all I was like, was it like guessing cards kind of stuff of like, I mean, you guessed.

I mean, it's in the red family.

If it be like, is it the six of clubs?

It'd be like seven of clubs and he'd be like, pretty close.

I mean, you know, these are plus or minus one.

Guys, this is, there's 26 cards, right?

How many cards?

52 actually.

Pretty close.

I saw him.

I saw a magician at the magic castle who was doing a lot of the fake messing ups.

You know, when you'd fake mess up and then go, but is this it?

Yeah.

And so it was a lot of fake those, but then actual messing up.

So every trick had a mess up and you could never tell.

It was a real or fake.

Waiting for the, waiting for the goody.

Oh, it was painful to watch, but little big boys on Netflix.

Me, you're painful to watch.

Speaking of an absolute chore, go check out LittleBigBoy.

LittleBigBoy.

But it's, it's, I, but it is about, there is stuff in there about, you know, getting, getting lit, getting fucking drunk.

Absolutely get fucking drunk.

Trico, four logo, dude.

It's all about how it ate local.

Yeah, they ate.

It's called a crazy.

A crazy.

Oh, okay.

And I haven't had a four logo in days.

I haven't had days really.

They really changed the recipe since last week.

Yeah, they fucking, and it sucks, man.

So I want to get hyped.

It's like, dude, we gotta go to the main office.

Dude, I want to get hyped and walked Santa Monica.

I want to hit, I want to hit it all.

Oh my gosh.

I'm eating a lot of plant, I mean, it's a big plant based diet for me at this point.

Okay.

Nick, I promised a couple of weeks ago I would ask you about Big Mouth.

Yeah.

Those characters that are based on Paul F. Tomkins and I, are they still on the show?

Yes, they are.

It's so funny that you guys, it really does look like it.

It really isn't you guys.

And we don't do the voice.

And you don't, and you for sure don't do the voices.

And you'll never do the voices.

You'll never do the voices.

And you'll never give us other voices.

Absolutely.

Because of us bringing this up.

Because you look like the guys.

So it would be so weird.

It would be too weird.

You guys, it is so funny.

They really, once someone pointed out, I was like, man, they do look like those guys.

And now anytime you post about the show, I notice there are comments under every comment.

And everyone is like, hey, when are you letting Paul and Scott do these voices?

And I go never.

Because they look like the guys.

So it's weird.

It's weird if they look like the characters, their voice, they get it.

It's weird if they don't look like the characters.

It is.

It's detective Flores and I can't believe I can't remember the other guy's name.

But it's based on Dennis Farina and.

And in Caruso, right?

And David Caruso.

How does that make you feel that you, so you look like Caruso.

I mean, I'd like to look like Caruso.

Yeah, DFT.

Do you think he wants?

I don't think he wants.

I mean, Farina, Farina now.

Yeah.

Sure.

Now?

It is.

Dead and buried?

Yeah.

I think it's aspirational.

It is both handsome guys.

I would, I would fuck both you and Paul right now.

Okay.

Here.

Let's get a deal.

Get the pot.

Yo, you want to get a deal.

Okay, let's do a deal.

Um, and I, can we just call it on and go?

Of course.

Cool.

We'll call it Belfmann.

Get his rips 69 year old.

He looks great by the way.

He's, he looks amazing.

Yeah.

I look at him and I go, man, I wish I could afford a trainer.

He's like, he can't.

How much do you think he pays his trainer?

Like, I'd say like $8 million a year.

I mean, there's, and I bet there's a lot of supplements.

Yeah.

Do you think he has his trainer on retainer?

Uh, he has got a retainer trainer.

Yeah.

I wouldn't.

And he, and also the retainer, the trainer is wearing a retainer.

Okay.

Cause it's like, just to make sure his bases are covered.

Well, it's right.

Yeah.

You want to cover your bases.

You have to in baseball.

Otherwise what?

People are just going to be running around him.

Like someone will come out from the dugout and go, he he he.

Run around the bases and like score a run.

Is it Michael Jackson?

He he he.

Michael Jackson, people don't know this.

Michael Jackson and terrible baseball.

He was bad.

He tried, cause he tried to do the Jordan thing.

He tried to do the Jordan thing.

Where he retired from music and he, and then he played outfield.

But with him.

I think he played center, right?

He played center field.

Cause he could cover a lot of ground.

Yeah.

Everywhere.

Cause you could do it fast.

Yes.

He could do it fast.

And then, but the problem was ultimately all the fentanyl.

Ultimately, it was.

It was probably, it was probably.

He was a fence of all the way to Dr.

Conrad Murray is back in the news.

What's he doing?

He's defending himself.

He gets the fact that he killed Michael Jackson.

Oh, well let him do that.

I mean, everyone has a right to do that.

Everyone has a right to defend.

One of the world's most famous, famous Conrad's.

Don't you agree?

Conrad Baines.

Conrad, of course.

Of course.

Conrad Murray.

Can you think of another one?

Conrad.

Conrad Mulcahy.

Okay.

There's a Conrad in a movie, I think.

Hey, Conrad.

Yes.

There's Robert Conrad, the guy who.

Robert Conrad.

Of course, the most famous thing that everybody knows is the, battle of the network stars.

Robert Conrad.

Sure.

Have those short shorts.

Yeah.

And he ran against Gabe Kaplan.

Yeah.

And Gabe smoked him, right?

Because also Robert Conrad was smoking.

Literally getting ready to, getting ready to fight to run a sprint and then Gabe Kaplan, there's probably the highest point in Jewish sports history.

It really was.

Gabe Kaplan smoked Robert Conrad in a late 70s TV track.

All it took was someone smoking and not warming up.

Gabe Kaplan, but is it, you know, there's a lot of Jewish guys actually in good shape.

I'd love to see you do battle of the network stars.

I would love to do battle the networks.

But like on Netflix, like battle of the Netflix stars.

It would be, it would be me, the stranger kids.

It would be the stranger kids.

You know, the great British make up.

You know, Paul Hollywood.

Mary Berry comes back.

Yeah.

Just like I want to be involved in this.

I would like to run a long race.

And then I think, and then it's, you know, those arcs.

Yeah.

And then, uh, shapelle, uh, and then shit.

I don't know.

Who else are, I think that's it.

That's all that's on the, that's all I can think of.

That's all that's on the stream.

Yeah.

Service.

I guess the cast of the between two ferns.

Absolutely.

You're going to get a McConaughey?

Sure.

McConaughey, Keanu, Will Ferrell, all of them.

They're part of the Netflix family at this point.

Oh, they're so part of it.

Um, all right.

Ryan Reynolds.

Oh, yes.

Little big boys on the streaming service Netflix now, as well as Big Mouth.

Uh, we have to take a break, Nick.

Are you prepared for that?

Yeah, I'm going to do some ads with me.

I will literally sit here and like lose animation.

Okay, great.

You'll just power down.

I will power down until I'm expected to be back.

All right.

We're going to take a break.

When we come back, we have someone with a supernatural conundrum and someone with a unique aspect to their personality.

Um, we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

Uh, Nick Kroll is here of Big Mouth.

Uh, we also knew him as Gilfizan.

Jam their view.

From, what was that show called again?

Oh, hello.

That's right.

Yes, of course.

You're going to turn around the emphasis on that one.

Oh, hello.

Uh, any more of that on the horizon?

Uh, people can go check out the big guys.

You can go fuck themselves.

You know, if they want more of that.

If they want more of that.

You can go fuck themselves.

Eat shit and die losers.

You'll never see us together again.

Oh, that's all across the board.

No matter what it is, whether it's, oh, hello, or other things, go fuck yourselves.

You schmuck losers.

You idiot bastards.

Go fuck your own ass.

Good night.

What if you had a big reunion show and it was just 90 seconds?

It was you saying that.

Eat shit.

We bought all this ad time.

We're going to do the whole show.

So I'll find it just to say eat shit and fuck you.

I see.

So I will say we did a podcast during the pod during the Podemic.

Please don't say there's a podemic.

I don't think I'll survive.

I just read an article for the Daily Beast called the Podemic.

How podcast are you killing themselves?

We the podcast.

It's all about the life and death of Princess Diana.

Oh, good.

It's the most.

The life was pretty long.

It was death was pretty quick.

It was.

So the first eight episodes are about the life.

And then I was like and then she died and it was over.

Yeah.

So it's a it's a I would highly recommend people go and check it out.

What's it all?

What's it even on?

How do you get it?

Each other and we're every where every piece is showed.

What's it called?

It's called the Oh hello pot.

It's called Dye Town.

Dye Town.

Yeah.

Oh hello, Pecas.

And it's we got it's the boys.

George and Gil looped in Ira glass and Sarah Canig to produce it.

They don't know what they're doing.

They don't think it's a podcast.

It's one of the most for me personally self indulgent.

That's saying something.

I mean, this is a guy who could polish off a Swiss thumb and fudge in there.

Six minutes.

I indulge my friend.

I indulge my bulge is the way I now talk about draining the main vein.

Okay.

And let's bring on one of our first guests.

Let's do that.

He has a supernatural conundrum.

Please welcome to the show Muddy Brickford.

Hi, buddy.

Hi.

Oh, are you Australian?

No, I'm a British.

Oh, you're British.

Oh, British.

Okay.

Good.

Hello.

Sorry to disappoint.

That's right.

You could talk probably instead of above it.

If you're this.

I guess so.

Is this the conundrum?

Is it working?

There you go.

Is this the conundrum?

Is the conundrum.

Yeah, is this it?

You're something going on with Mike?

No, conundrum is not me talking into the fucking mic.

Oh, I didn't realize you could curse on this show.

I didn't do it in 14 years.

Cursing and just feeling like you're going to get in trouble every time.

Exactly.

Conan's going to come in here and slap a wrist and Barack Obama.

Yeah.

Do you know who Barack Obama is?

Yeah.

Okay.

He has a podcast with Bruce Springsteen.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Did you ever heard it?

You know the guy who does Hungry Heart?

I'm not a big Springsteen guy.

You're not.

Can you name it?

I went to a Bruce Springsteen concert with someone who leaned over and confessed.

Leveling up.

Boy, you do.

Okay.

He confessed that he didn't know a single Bruce Springsteen song.

And I said that's impossible.

You have to know one.

Is an American person?

It's an American person.

Mm-hmm.

And he said I couldn't even name one.

And we watched the entire thing.

He was given the- He was a Billy Joel.

William Joel.

He was given the tickets.

And he asked me two hours before the show because whoever he was going to go was dropped out.

And so we watched the entire thing and then dancing in the dark started at the very, in the encore and he leaned over to me and nodded and said, yep, no, this one.

Are you like that?

Is that Courtney Cox?

Yes.

She's in that one.

She's in the video.

Yes.

She's not in the actual song.

He doesn't actually sing Courtney Cox.

No, he should.

Oh, she's stunning.

The He-Man movie.

Remember Masters of the Universe?

I do.

Yeah.

With Dolph Lundgren.

Yeah.

Dolph Lundgren.

Courtney Cox.

He's also- he's a pretty handsome guy.

Dolph for Springsteen.

Springsteen too.

Who's more handsome?

Dolph Lundgren or Springsteen?

Now.

These days?

Now then and as a young kid.

Lundgren.

All across the board?

Yeah.

Across the board.

Any age, any moment in time.

Lundgren.

What about you Nick?

I got to go Bruce.

I go Bruce in the 80s certainly.

Not you don't like a big buff guy.

What do you- what do you- Lundgren.

I mean, Lundgren was a big- Oh, oh, oh.

Big man.

Yeah.

Bruce looks good in that shirt with the sleeves rolled up.

You don't know anything about him, but you know about something he wore once?

He's always wearing- he's always rowing up his sleeves.

He looks good like that.

So you know him as a rolled sleeve individual mainly.

Yeah.

Catch him with his shirt off, catch him on the toilet.

He looks so dumb being tight.

Dolph Lundgren still looks tight.

He looks nice.

Even on the toilet.

It's hard to catch.

Anyway.

I will say this.

It's hard to catch Dolph Lundgren on the toilet.

Yeah.

Lundgren.

That's what we're talking about.

Dolph Dolph goes really quickly.

Dolph Lundgren.

Wait, we're talking about- oh, you're talking about Dolph Lundgren the actor.

You were talking about- Oh, I'm talking about Dolph Lundgren.

He's my neighbor.

Who I'm talking about.

Yeah.

Oh, we're not talking about the actor Dolph Lundgren.

Oh, sorry.

My neighbor.

Sorry.

No, your neighbor is more handsome.

Yeah.

We live very close to each other.

Oh, you do.

Where do you live?

Stratford upon Avon.

Yeah.

I have a place there.

I have a summer home in Stratford on Avon.

Great.

Upon.

Yeah.

I have a pun home there.

It's based on the musical fun home.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

So wait, you have three daughters?

Three daughters.

Everybody's coming out the whole time.

So tell me, Muddy, you're an English person.

We know that about you.

You're not a spring scene fan.

You know who Barack Obama is.

That's the extent of the information we know about you at this point.

Tell us a little more.

Well, give us a taste.

As you mentioned, I've come here with a bit of a supernatural conundrum.

I was on all the day in Ireland.

That's vacation for the people here in the States.

And...

Sorry, what island or just...

Ireland.

I'm sorry.

I thought like I was on like all the day.

Like, and you would say Ireland.

I'm sorry, go ahead.

That's not a phrase.

Nobody says on Ireland.

Okay.

People say specific islands.

They're telling us.

People will say, people say, I'm Billy, you know, I like, Bruce, Bruce, he's a Jersey guy.

Billy Joel, he's from the island.

Yeah.

Right, right.

If there's context.

Yes.

Yeah, but no one says, I'm going on Ireland.

Right.

You have no idea when I was talking about it.

I'm not from the UK, so I don't know all that stuff.

Well, even in the UK, we want you to know what we're talking about.

So even in the UK, people explain things and people use more words.

We use specificities just so people know what we're talking about.

We don't get into things like this where people, you know, we spent, you know, 10 minutes now just figuring out where I went on all the time.

Okay, but it was to Ireland.

Ireland.

And this is, this is what Ireland Baldwin was named after?

Sorry.

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

Exactly right.

Interesting.

Who probably has a place on the island?

Probably.

Is that the daughter?

Is that the selfish little pig?

That's how he referred to her.

That's how I referred to her.

I think she's wonderful.

She's according to him.

She's a selfish little pig.

For the record, the last weird thing Alec Baldwin did.

Right.

Remember, it's the one thing I know.

You're nobody in Hollywood until Alec Baldwin kills you.

Allegedly.

Right.

Yeah.

So I'm on all the day in Ireland.

Thank you.

That's her doll, Flum Le Grunge.

Okay, go ahead.

I'm chomping around in the woods because I'm an avid icon.

Right.

Okay.

And we say that how often do you hike?

Like once a week, three times a day.

What are we talking about?

Well, to be avid about something.

I mean, that's your hobby.

Is that a good thing?

I got a long driveway in the mailboxes all the way down.

So that's a good thing.

Do you consider that a hike?

I don't.

Okay.

I'm not going to do that.

It's all everything sort of wove in.

It's not just a fun force.

One organism.

One like whole standing.

It's all woven together.

It's a lattice work of plants and shit.

I don't know.

I'm looking around.

I'm going, God, it's crazy in here.

I see these little lights.

Is it all willow, the wispy sort of little thing.

Flying around or?

Yeah.

Flowing around in the heather in the fucking house.

It's like the movie legend, really Scott's legend.

What was that?

That was Tom Cruise.

Tom Cruise, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

One of his first starring films.

Yeah.

That's the first time they used that like wish master mic up.

The demon in that, they sort of like repurposed that for every movie.

Really?

Oh, yeah.

The one Tim Curry uses.

They repurposed it for, I guess.

It's sort of every month to sort of look like that after that movie.

Well, except for the monsters.

Right.

No, they look very, except for the niece, she sort of looked like.

True.

So I see these little, I got what the fuck he says.

And they're sort of floating around.

There's these little sprites, these little fairies.

I go, hello, look at you.

You're a little fucking fairy.

I got, because I carry a lot in my pack, my backpack.

Sure.

I come prepared, so I took out some, I caught one.

Are you a fairy-ness with, yeah, Matt?

Or how did you?

With my hands.

Oh, okay.

Sorry, you, you, you mind using a tool?

Well, no.

So I, so, you almost like you hammered your, your, your.

Yeah, can I explain it to the audience?

Yeah.

I think just so they can't see it.

Right.

He's got meaty hands.

He's got a meaty, he's got a separate hand that he holds like a, like a paddle.

Oh, I see.

Oh, like a, like one of those, I had one once.

It's like a thing, like a fake arm with a.

Yes.

Like a grabber arm and you can do it yourself off.

Yeah.

That's what I did.

Yeah, I carry around an extra hand.

I was always going to have an extra set of hands.

As you know, I did.

So you just caught it, caught it.

I caught it.

I had some dental floss and I tied dental floss around.

You really do have everything.

It's leg around a slate.

So you, you tied it up.

I tied it and I kept it on a little leash and I captured it.

Right.

I took it home.

Okay.

How did, how did, how did, can it communicate with you?

Oh, it never shows.

Is this the international conundrum?

Okay.

It's actually a supernatural conundrum.

So it is an international story.

It is, for me, it's an international conundrum because here you are from England.

Yeah, you've crossed it.

But you're doing, you're telling a story that's happening in Ireland.

You crossed state lines at this point.

And here we are in the United States of America.

It's a supernatural conundrum that has international implications.

Okay, fair enough.

All right.

You're trafficked.

You're fairy trafficked.

Right.

Is it with you?

It's well, hang on.

Don't get too excited.

Okay.

So listen.

The corpses rotting away on a, on a, sorry, sorry, sorry.

Yes.

It said, you know, you can have a wish or give you, if you set me free.

Oh, one wish if you said that sounds like a wish.

One equitable trade.

Right.

But I know how these fairies work and leprechauns and shit.

If I ask for a big cock, I'm going to get a 10 foot cock and never going to be able to buy pants again.

Monkey's paw.

So monkey's paw.

Yeah.

A fucking monkey's paw.

I go, I know you.

I got to think about this.

If I say, what million dollars, suddenly my dad's dead and I get like an inherent, an inherent instance, something, you know, and then you got paid, you know, $980,000 of taxes on it.

Right.

Yeah.

So I'm pretty smart.

Where's 20 grand for your dad being dead?

I did not bad.

Bilateral tickets with that.

You can build on build.

So I thought, let me come.

You guys are a bunch of smart guys.

I mean, you're not lawyers or anything, but like.

I played a lawyer on television.

Have you?

Mm hmm.

Well, well, I play a cop a lot.

Yeah.

I'm big mouth.

Yeah.

Not a big mouth.

And you know, that's right.

And the new movie, Weird on the Roku channel.

Oh, God.

That out.

So, okay, these are a bunch of smart guys.

So you, you went from not being able to figure out your wish to immediately coming here because we're a bunch of smart guys.

Well, yeah, we, there are any more that he flew.

He flew, I would imagine he flew back from Ireland to England.

To England.

Big fan of the show knew that Scott's a smart guy.

Hopefully another.

Hopefully Nick would be there.

It's been.

Yep.

It's been.

It's been a while.

You then, you fly your, did you fly with your ferry over as your ferry back in, in.

Did you have to pay for a seat for the ferry?

Like Bono paid for a seat for his hat.

Yeah.

I smuggled the ferry in an L towards tin.

With all of it, I hope.

Oh, they don't.

It's a magical creature.

Oh, it doesn't need to breathe.

It doesn't need.

Okay.

I mean, it likes to breathe, but it doesn't need to.

It doesn't need to.

It's a lock it away because as soon as you stop, its voice is very hypnotic and enchanting.

As soon as you stop letting it talk, it starts.

Right.

Won't, as you earlier said, it won't shut the fuck up.

It won't shut the fuck up and suddenly.

So is it possible that it just talks, talks, talks until you say, I wish you would shut the fuck up.

Oh, that's a good.

That's, I mean, that's an idea.

Then it, then it.

Then it.

Oh, wait, you just looked down.

Is it, is he.

He or she?

We don't want to.

It's a she.

Yeah.

She.

Is she in your jacket right now?

Well, look, I don't want everybody to get excited.

It's my, I want to say this right straight out.

Okay.

It's my fucking little sprite.

We can't get a wish.

We can't get like a little run off.

This is what I was afraid of.

All right.

This is my, let us wet our beaks.

You guys can help me.

Give us a half an hour.

It's my wish.

Why would we do that?

Without any sort of incense.

This fucking, can you give me one wish?

What do you want to wish?

I want to wish.

Can I pitch one?

I want a seven inch cock.

I don't want to wish.

I'm your wife.

I don't know what that is.

What?

I don't want to wish.

I'm your wife.

Is that a British?

It's from the movie, The Princess Bright.

The Princess Sprite.

The Princess drinks a Sprite.

The Princess drinks a, do you, would you, have you, can I, okay, can I give a suggestion?

I want a lifetime of Sprite.

Then the Sprite, trying to confuse you not to give you exactly what you want.

Monkey's paw and you, gives you a lifetime of sprites that then you can ask for a picture.

Ask for more wishes, yeah.

Ask for more wishes.

Because it'll think she, rather, will think you want a lifetime supply of Sprite, the wonderful drink that the Pepsi Company, I believe?

I think the PepsiCo?

Yeah.

You get a Taco Bell.

There is a Frito-Lay.

A PepsiCo business.

A PepsiCo, a Coca-Cola.

Aquafina, a water, and then, and then a performer.

Do you think Aquafina is now going to have to call itself Aquafina the water instead of the actress?

Right.

Because of Aquafina?

Sure.

Water from Queens.

Yeah.

All right.

What's up?

Oh, I'm looking.

I don't want to fuck around.

I'm looking for a little bit.

Stop fucking around.

Get to your thing.

Never.

You spend so much time describing this fucking field that no one cares about.

And then, boom, suddenly you've caught this fairy.

It's like, let's get back to the lattice work of roots.

All right.

I'm not going to make a wish where I go like, oh, let me assume how the Sprite's going to try to fuck with me.

It's leaving too.

I need an airtight, like a fucking contractual right.

So you want us to what?

No hoes right up the right details.

Here's my suggestion.

Wish for an airtight wish.

One they can't fuck with and then they got to give it to you.

Yeah.

It's a terrible idea.

Are you going to take that back?

No, I really, I came in hard.

I came in hard with my take.

Everyone was excited.

And then I pitched the not funny, not useful.

And I'm going to own that.

It's not, it's a good stuff.

Look, I'm not, what do you want?

Because you mentioned like your dick size.

Is that what you want?

You want a 10 foot dick?

No.

What do you want?

And we'll tell you how to hammer this.

Can I ask what's going on?

Are you married?

No.

Do you want a family?

If it's with the right.

I figure you get this without a wish.

Sorry.

I get their families without a wish.

Trying to figure out what you're really needing your life.

Yeah, what do you want?

What's the work like for you?

Tell us your desires.

Yeah.

You haven't thought about this?

You have a fairy.

I mean, here's the issue.

But what?

Are you working?

Are you fulfilled by your work?

Often on, you know, I work retail at top man.

You work retail?

Man, wait, what can a store stop at?

As a clothing.

It's clothing.

It could have been anything.

It could have been food.

It could have been the grove.

Yeah, they got a top man.

I don't know.

I don't shop at top man.

You know?

No, I'm a forever 21.

He works at, he shops at bottom boy.

Now I went in there.

I got to confess for the first time thinking it wasn't a clothing store.

Yeah, yeah.

So here we are.

It's okay.

Oh, I think I hear your.

Oh, oh.

Muddy, I think I hear your fairy.

Did you?

She's quiet.

You're right, that is hypnotic.

Beautiful.

Hang out.

I'm sorry.

Hi.

Hi, Scott.

Can I have a wish?

Oh, yes, of course, if you free me.

So what?

Overpower Muddy and then for you?

Is that what the conditions are?

You give you.

Oh, no, he's fucking.

No, he's fucking.

Fuck you.

No, you.

He's fucking.

No, no, no, no.

Stand down.

Oh, no, no, no, no, stay down, motherfucker.

Stand down, motherfucker.

I am fucking.

I am.

I am fucking Nick.

Oh, oh, oh.

Got him.

Okay.

Hey.

All right, we beat the shit out of money.

Now, my friend Nick helped me.

Can Nick have a wish too?

Because we beat the shit out of money.

If he frees me.

We'll get out of money.

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

Fuck it, now I can throw.

Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

Get it, get it, get it, get it.

I am.

Hi.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, oh, I'm tangled in your hair.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry.

Hold on, let me get it out.

Okay, is it out?

Oh, I can't quite lock you in here.

Fuck you, dude.

Fuck you.

You're the most fucking.

Fuck you.

No, it's mine.

It's mine.

Oh, stay down motherfucker.

All right.

What's your name?

What's your name, dear?

What's your name, hon?

I, my name is Miffrin.

Miffrin, that's a beautiful name.

I'm older than the rocks and the stones.

I'm not interested in your history, babe.

I live in the grove.

It's a lattice worm.

You live at the grove?

You're a top man in this one?

Hey, Nick, put that gun down.

No.

This is it.

I'm not.

Shit.

I'm a permitator at it.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, shit.

I can't believe I missed.

Oh, I'm shot out.

I'm shot out.

You grazed me.

Oh, I'm not shot.

I hate it.

All right, have her.

Have her.

Oh, fuck.

I wish I knew I had her name a gun.

Oh, you wish you knew how to aim a gun?

Yes.

Wait, kid, do you know?

I wish I knew how to name a gun.

Wait, you're confused, Miffrin?

Yes.

Do you want to get, you want to get some clarity on this?

I wish I knew how to name a gun.

That's what I said.

Okay.

All right.

Are you ready to grant this wish?

Yes.

If you free her, you got to free her though.

I'll free her.

Okay, so go ahead.

Okay.

You're free.

Yee.

Now, do you know how to name a gun now?

Yeah.

Like what?

Morris.

There you go.

Okay.

All right, Miffrin, you're free.

Okay.

Thank you.

Okay.

Can you take me home?

Take you home to Ireland?

Yeah, I don't live here.

Oh, what is it?

Just explain what your place looks where your home is.

It's a good last.

It's a moist.

It's a very nice.

Look.

Look, we look, I, you're going to have to hitch a ride or something.

I can't afford.

Yeah.

I don't like it.

I guess like a book of flag of miles.

You got miles?

I got a book of flight for you.

I'll give you wish.

If I take you to Ireland?

Yeah.

I would probably just wish for something that is equivalent to the price of flying to Ireland.

I mean, that's like 10 grand or something, especially if you're first class.

Yeah.

I don't know.

I, you know what, 11 grand maybe?

I gave you back.

You gave me back with what?

Fairy bucks.

I don't think so.

You're a rose.

What do you got in Ireland?

What do you guys got in Ireland these days?

You guys doing, you guys doing your own?

Unification.

Yeah.

No thanks.

How do you feel about reunification?

We'll see.

You know, so that's a good answer.

I don't know.

I, I can't go to Ireland.

I have a busy schedule.

He's got a baby.

For anything you want hungry.

Okay.

All right.

Well, here's what I want.

A party-sized bag of chlorine charitos.

And we said, we said party size, not party size like candies, like fun-sized candies.

No, I mean a big bag.

Big ass.

I said I'm hungry.

Yeah.

He'll feed you if you give him.

I thought you were saying, I'll give you anything you want to get me back to Ireland.

What I want in return is I think she's saying she's hungry.

Oh, I got at this party-sized bag of chlorine charitos.

You already had a party-sized bag of?

Why are you wishing for another one?

At post podcast.

This is a mid podcast.

I'm not going to eat it now.

I'll eat it post podcast.

She's bullshitting.

Hey.

Let me up.

Shut the fuck up, buddy.

He's the smallest boy.

I hiked and I found it.

Yeah, we heard all about your hike.

You're the beautiful fucking- Yeah.

Oh, gee.

Okay.

Tell you what, if you take her back to Ireland.

You take her back?

Yeah.

Okay.

We'll let you up.

All right.

No.

Because Nick's got Morris over here.

I got Morris and I know how to name him.

All right.

We'll let you up.

Come on back.

Fuck it in.

All right, buddy.

That's funny.

All right, buddy.

That's funny.

What happened?

You know what happens if you fuck with us, though, right?

Yeah, she's kill me much, bro.

It's not ours to give.

We freed her.

Yeah.

Me friend.

All right.

I got this bottle of empty bottle of Sprite.

Yeah.

Do you want to use that?

I can grab.

You guys, get her towards the corner.

Get her to the corner.

Get her.

Okay.

All right.

It's up hitting the microphone.

Put the cap on.

I got it.

Put the Sprite back in your Sprite bottle.

Yeah.

Oh.

Oh, sorry.

She's trying to say something.

I'm going to open the Sprite and what do you say?

I can't breathe in here.

I thought you were an adjective.

You don't have to.

Yeah.

You don't have to breathe.

No, I do.

You do have to breathe.

All right.

Oh, you do.

You should have really checked that part.

All right.

I'm going to leave the top off the Sprite bottle.

Okay.

I'm here.

I go escaping.

Oh, man.

Oh, well, we don't know how to solve this problem.

Are you?

What?

Come here, fool.

I don't fucking know.

You thought we were smart guys?

Supernatural conundrum.

You're an astronaut conundrum for us.

I know.

So what?

I don't know, dude.

I honestly, I just want you to know what you need in your life more than anything else.

That's a big question.

I want some kind of direction.

How about take this fucking Sprite back?

I die really good.

Do you?

Okay.

How about East, my man?

Yeah.

Well, that's a...

Have you ever thought maybe you and my friend are supposed to be together?

Yeah.

I mean, how would that work?

I don't know.

She's got holes.

What?

Excuse me.

I don't know.

But you guys like...

You know about my whole...

Oh, no, no.

You guys have matching personalities is all I'm saying.

We do?

Yeah.

You're kind of a drip.

She's like kind of boring.

I'm a drip.

Look, honestly, George, God.

I'm an evanica.

No, you're not.

You're a muddie.

She's from a drippy place.

You're boring.

She's from a drippy place.

I'm boring.

Yeah, you're boring.

You're boring.

You went down like a sack of potatoes.

You go creature on your show.

Yeah.

It gives a fuck.

It's been magical creatures on the show before.

Yeah, man.

That doesn't allow me.

That don't impress me much.

No, she's not a twanger.

Oh, you know her.

Yeah.

Okay.

She's got those rolled up sleeves.

Yeah.

Look, Muddy, we got to take a break.

Oh.

Can you stick around though?

Hey, we stick around.

Yeah, stick around.

At a certain level.

Mifferly stick around.

Yeah.

Okay, good.

When we come back, we have someone with a unique aspect to them.

That sounds exciting.

That's fucking amazing.

That's pod-natural.

That's fantastic.

Canundrum can go fuck itself and pull up against it.

What did you say?

Unique aspects.

Yeah.

No, none of my aspects.

No.

Nothing unique about bringing a magical creature.

No.

Considering walking to the mailbox, a hike is pretty fucking unique.

I'm going to stick a break.

When we come back, we'll have more than a crawl.

Wait, I'm sorry.

More, Muddy.

Can we swear on the show?

Yeah.

We'll be right back.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back.

Nick Kroll is here.

We have Little Big Boy.

Big Mouth.

We have everything out there on Netflix right now.

Muddy is here as well.

And Mifferin.

Hi, Mifferin.

Yeah.

That's a fly in front of the mic if you want to be heard.

Okay.

Hi.

Good to see you.

You're so cute.

I wouldn't say your voice is hypnotic, but it really didn't live up to time.

You can say that.

It's hypnotic to me.

I don't know.

I guess.

See, you guys are made for each other.

Yeah.

Because maybe that's the wishes that you find love with each other.

Yeah.

How am I supposed to...

I don't know.

The weird things have happened.

Maybe I'll come around by the end.

Okay.

Maybe we'll see.

But speaking of the end, we got one more guest before we get there.

We have to introduce him.

He has a unique aspect to his character.

And that is, he's the world's busiest man.

He's welcome, Ned Bellanella.

Hey, Scott.

Thank you for having me.

Hey, Ned.

How you doing?

Good to see you.

This is Nick Croll.

Hi, Nick.

This is Muddy.

Hi, Muddy.

This is Mipren.

Hey, Mipren.

Hi.

Not very interesting that she's a little spright.

You're great, Switches.

Yeah, that's fine.

It's not interesting.

You know, the guy seems more interesting to me than me.

At least there you go.

Everybody called me.

Ned, you're already interested in it.

Yeah, well, thank you very much.

You know what?

I'm a busy guy.

Who's the world's busiest man?

Is that true?

Yeah, and that's how I'm here to talk to you about how I manage to do it.

Yes, I am the world's busiest man.

Is that official?

That's just something you call you.

I'm just always running.

That's not answering my question.

Yes, I am.

It's official.

Goddammit, it's official.

Okay?

I'm always running.

I'm always doing errands.

I have tons of jobs.

I'm a party plan.

I'm a toy maker.

I'm a chef.

I have hundreds of friends.

I have a husband, a wife.

I have kids.

Yes, I have tons of, I do tons of things.

I am a husband.

Did I say I am?

I am a husband.

I was going to say, because you could have a husband, a wife, that would be very busy.

That would be very busy.

I thought that was part of your busyness.

No, it's not just in a wife.

No, you're not going to get stuck up.

We're not going to get stuck on things that I say.

It's not stuck up.

No.

How are you doing it?

I don't take it off those trees.

I was doing any derailleting this old show.

Listen, I got a lot of stuff going on.

November is my busiest month.

I was going to say he's busier than you.

He's not, he can't get stuck on this day.

There's only 30 days in November though.

What's that?

There's only 30 days.

I don't know if you know this.

Any months with 31 days in it would have to be busy.

Excuse me.

I got to take this call, Scott.

I got to take this call.

You have a call?

Hello?

Yes?

I told you what I wanted in the painting.

Yeah?

Two nude ladies.

Uh-huh.

Completely seductive on the ground.

Yes.

Kneel de grass Tyson.

That's right.

His hand is a wand.

Yes.

Spread ass.

That's right.

Yeah, they're all in Starbucks.

Extra wet.

See you on Tuesday.

Thank you.

So sorry about that.

They were talking the whole time he's talking.

Sorry, that's Scott.

So who was that?

That was your assistant or that was the painter?

No, there was somebody at a commission for a painting.

I apologize.

I've got a lot of stuff going on right now.

I can't really talk.

Oh, okay.

So, look, I'm a private man.

Okay.

So, everything.

Please try not to ask me any questions about these phone calls I make.

I will get a hug.

You're already planning on more phone calls?

I don't know.

I just like...

Hold on, Scott.

I got to get another phone call.

Okay.

All right.

Hold on a second.

Yes?

You got a green light.

My first movie.

Excellent.

Wow.

I want you to call it my onion.

Yes.

$300?

Okay.

That seems worth it.

Let's do it.

Total budget and the price of the onion.

You got it.

Okay.

Thank you very much.

Oh, sorry about that, Scott.

So, yes.

So, what are you talking about?

How about it?

Did you manage the sold movie?

Did a movie just get green lit?

Yes.

I can't really call it about an hour.

It's called my onion.

It's my favorite onion.

It lasts 300 hours, so that's the sheet of chicken.

$300 is the budget?

$300.

Yes, you say a dollar.

Oh, I heard that.

What about 300 hours?

300 hours.

I don't have that.

What was that movie?

You think I have that?

$187?

$187.

So, it would be a little bit old.

Yes, James, I can't go.

I've never seen it.

I can't sit long enough for a goddamn...

It's too long for a movie.

Oh, excuse me.

That's my other phone.

I can't take these calls at your own.

All right, I want you to go into my backyard.

Okay, you see the fence?

Make a left.

Yes.

Walk over to the small creek now.

There should be a finger sticking out of the ground.

Exactly.

As if to say, you who over here.

Yes.

Now, I watch you.

That's where the body's buried.

All five dogs, okay?

They should be decaying.

What I'm guessing is, you know, about as big as a bush.

Exactly.

I want you to give them a Viking funeral and see me on Tuesday.

Bye-bye.

Hi.

Sorry.

Hi.

That's a very tall.

Why was there a finger amongst all the dogs?

A human finger?

This is client attorney privilege.

I can't really talk about that.

That was your attorney.

I'm also a lawyer on the side.

Oh, it's a son of a bell.

I have tons of jobs.

The dogs are the humans who have killed the dogs.

I've never defended how would you that work?

A dog attorney.

I don't know.

I mean, it's a great movie.

Write it down.

It's a great...

Dogs are supposed to represent themselves in your...

What kind of budget?

What kind of budget would you need for dog attorney?

Aahh, dog attorney, Jesus.

We talk to CGI here or real dog.

No, ribo.

CGI human's real dogs.

CGI human real dogs?

Oh, $350.

Okay.

All right.

We can't buy the peanut butter.

You'd have to make it.

I'm sorry.

This is my mom's OBGYN.

Okay.

I gotta get this.

Go ahead.

Okay.

Hello?

I'm sorry.

Your mom's over.

Wow.

Doctor.

That pink.

Unbelievable.

And the medicine goes where?

Inside.

Uh-huh.

I'll make sure to tell her.

Well, she'd be where this held, Dr. Sivio.

Okay.

Sorry about that, guys.

I don't know that I want to know that.

I just called my mom for a second and I don't know about it.

Yeah, and then I just...

I gotta go ahead and...

Oh, you know what?

My mom is calling right now.

Okay.

She's calling.

Hello, mom?

Yes.

Okay.

Listen.

You need to...

It's slip inside.

I want you on your back in bed with your feet up in the air towards the ceiling.

Put Elsa on.

Just put Elsa on.

Who's Elsa?

Elsa is...

Her helper.

Oh, yes.

Yes.

Put her feet in the air.

Listen to what she says and I'll give you an Oreo, Elsa.

I'll give you a little fucking Oreo and get your mouth full of chocolatey.

Okay?

Thank you.

Bye.

Oh, God.

Did you do it?

I hope she did.

My mom's in trouble.

Is your mom expecting?

My mom is not expecting.

But she could still carry a child?

Yeah, there's something wrong with her down there.

She's going to the OBGYN.

Yes, and her OBGYN reports to me because she's kind of nuts.

So it's a little...

Attorney...

Privilege is important to you.

I don't care that my mom is trying to collect the health.

No, no, no.

It's an example to us all.

I use her to talk about, you know, the disease.

Yeah, that's all right.

Can we talk about what you're here to talk about?

Sure, yes.

I'm talking about how to manage your time correctly.

Okay, it doesn't seem like you're doing it on the way.

Tricks, anything like that.

What do you mean?

Well, I mean, you've taken five phone calls since you've been here.

I'm sorry.

That's my computer alarm.

I've got to take some computer first.

Yeah, no problem.

Yeah, go ahead.

How much computer?

Just one sip of kombucha.

Why do you need an alarm for one sip of kombucha?

I just need to remind myself.

I can't, I don't remember.

My doctor prescribed me kombucha, please, please, please.

It's okay.

All right, calm down.

So you're here to talk about tips.

I'm here to talk about tips and tricks about how to manage your time.

Okay, what's the main tip that we have?

The main tip is, I'm sorry.

Just give me one second here.

Okay, hello?

Yes, I'm just planning a Thanksgiving party.

Yes, hello.

Yes, I'm trying to cater a small Thanksgiving together.

60 to 70 people.

Small?

Yes.

Okay, one classic Thanksgiving sandwich.

Mm-hmm, no turkey.

Okay, limp celery sticks.

Make sure they're very limp and wet.

That's right.

And pineapple juice.

Just a body, please.

Yes.

Mustard all day.

All day long, all the way.

Outside the bun, please.

Yes.

With that, Villa, Black Olive, extra wet.

That's right.

A leave is fine, sir.

A leave is fine.

And Olive's in a plastic bag with raisins.

That's right.

And you can make sure an old woman with a drinking a doctor pepper with dirty red nails.

Touch is everything.

Thank you so much.

Okay, sorry about that.

Okay.

That was, sorry.

No, thank you.

It's November.

I told you it's my busiest month.

Just because of what?

Because of the sheer number of phone calls I get.

Okay, it's okay.

It's okay.

Oh my God, that's my plumber.

Hold on, it's okay.

It's all right.

Hi, Ivan.

Yes.

Okay, so here's the deal, Ivan.

I cut the turd with a paper plate.

Yes.

Mm-hmm.

Well, it was huge, but that wasn't the problem.

I tried to flush the plate, Ivan.

I don't know.

I just know that my socks were completely soaked, Ivan.

Yes.

Okay, thank you so much.

I'll make sure to tell them.

Okay.

All right, bye then.

Okay, that's good.

I'm sorry about that.

It's no problem.

So did you ever get to that first tip?

We got to get that first tip.

Was it your shit?

Yes, it was a very long shit.

It was long.

That was the issue.

Well, have you ever tried to take a very long shit?

Have you ever tried to take a very long shit?

No, I tried to make a show that's possible.

You've got to keep packing it in there.

Don't shit.

I don't want to get to that.

I don't want to get to that first tip.

I don't want to take these on air.

Oh no, Dr. Sivio.

They didn't get the results back yet.

Apparently a hungry nurse ate some of the wires.

I don't want to get the results back.

Can I do an impression of me calling her to check in on her?

Hello nurse!

I love that.

You have enough time to love that.

I'm flying out of Kansas City on July 4th at 5 in the morning.

I don't think there will be fireworks at 5 a.m.

You will circle the U.S. for about 6 months from July 4th until you land under your ear.

That's the plan.

Riefil in the air.

Stanley Kubrick style.

He did that in his movie.

What do you think the budget for that movie was?

I'm going to show you a movie all the way through.

You're so busy.

I have twins.

My son's school.

My girlfriend will handle it.

Are you sleeping with an administrator at this school?

I'm so busy.

I come so quickly.

I'm not sure.

I'm sweating like a pig.

I'm sorry.

Jacob, I lost all the evidence.

It was a mistake to take you to the beach.

I apologize.

I'm getting asked a question.

Jacob, call Jacob the lawyer.

Jacob from the accident.

Sure, that's him.

You lost his evidence?

I apologize for walking into the ocean carrying pills and pills of water and spilling it into my trunk where the documents were.

I'm sorry, Jacob.

Come boot your time.

I can't say that this appearance was successful.

We got the one tip and that was it.

I apologize.

Put your hands down.

You have a problem with my...

How many more calls do you have?

Do you?

It's just hold on a second.

Is this a different phone?

You son? I left him in the hair salon, sweetie.

I was there to see an older woman I'm dating and of course, to get my crack waxed.

Yes, I forgot him there.

And the crypt should be extra wet, sweetie.

Okay, look. We're running out of time.

I'm running out of time too. I have to get out of here.

Yeah, I understand.

But we only have time for one final feature on the show.

That's a little something called plugs.

I need a favor.

I hate to ask it.

To pick you up and up the plug.

A basket.

It goes so many plugs.

It's a fantastic supply.

A basket.

And I don't want to use it as my gasket.

I'm running out of time.

Hey, nice and short. I love it.

That was Plug Basket by Ben Centra.

All right, Ben.

Ben, Nick, what do you want to plug?

I want to plug...

I think we've spent the whole time.

A little big boy on Netflix and Big Mouth.

New season also on Netflix.

Wonderful.

Muddy Brickford.

Oh, I don't have anything to plug, but I'd like to take this moment to propose.

What?

There's a little...

Promence out.

Oh, yes.

You guys were right.

I'm a minister on the side.

Oh, are you?

Yes, do you take this?

I don't want to add anything more to your plate.

No, no, no, no, no.

Are you ready?

Do you want to do it now?

Are you ready?

She hasn't even said you.

She hasn't even said yes.

Oh, check your eyes.

I'm right.

How is he, Ned?

Is my wish for you to be my wife?

Oh, I don't know how I feel about this kind of like...

You're mister's grand.

Oh, did she romantic?

I don't know.

Did she romantic?

I don't know.

In the 90s, this would be romantic and now it just feels perfect.

All right, now it just feels perfect.

I now pronounce you man and wife.

Oh, man and fairy.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, it made me the happiest man.

And I'm happy too.

Oh, great.

No, it wasn't wish.

Okay, I got the deal.

You're still happy.

Okay, congratulations you too.

I wonder how this...

I wonder what the turn will be for this...

Yeah, the big, ironic twist.

Never.

Yeah.

Oh, what an island.

Ned, do you have anything you want to plug for?

Yes, I would love to plug...

Hold on a second.

Oh, geez.

Oh, no.

Again.

Yes?

Doctor?

What do you mean?

Don't do it.

What do you mean don't slip it inside?

What?

Oh, no, I'm just gonna slip it inside.

I got a...

Yes.

Mom, put it inside.

What do you mean you already put it in there?

Elsa, take it out!

Christ, listen to me.

It's not working.

What do you mean I'm getting your phone call?

Oh, Jesus Christ, it's too much going on.

You're getting your phone out of the world?

If it's leaking, that's the problem Elsa.

That's the problem.

It turned him out.

He didn't breathe up extra wet.

Oh, no.

The wedding ring...

The wedding ring's a little tight.

It's a little uncomfortable.

Oh.

Oh, no.

Can I actually not get a looser wedding ring?

No.

Oh, no.

That's the ironic twist.

You're wedding ring is slightly...

Can I take it off some time?

No, you don't get a little tighter.

You keep getting tighter.

Your finger is turning blue.

Oh, blue.

It's just a little tight.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, my God.

Yeah, yeah.

It's as blue as a dang smurf.

No.

Oh, this is bad.

Well, I'd like to plug my butcher shop.

Oh.

You have a butcher shop.

Yeah.

What?

Okay, sure.

Go ahead.

I've got to have been there.

Can't tell you what it looks like or where it is.

The name?

It's not a bad name for a butcher shop.

No, that's right.

My uncle Dupree runs it right now.

See what you mean Dupree was based on?

That's exactly right.

You mean Dupree is about my butcher shop.

He's a fucking idiot.

He's old with me.

Did you make that movie?

I did make that movie.

What was the budget on that?

$325.

$26.

So low budget.

Is that low?

Yeah.

I'm not sure.

What kind of budget do you think is high?

I mean, I don't know.

Like probably $400.

Yeah, probably $400, right?

Yeah.

$400 seems astronomical to me.

It's insane.

Usually a big budget comes in around $350.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, great.

Butchies go, if you can find it.

Yes.

Yeah, but all the meat will be eaten by Dupree unfortunately.

My uncle.

I would have plugged the Comedy Bang Bang book.

I'm still signing copies.

You can still order a signed copy.

It comes out in April.

Head over to comedybangbangworld.com slash book to order one of the signed copies or just order a regular copy.

All right.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

Yeah.

Take one hand, put it up, take me on a door and down.

You're gonna make a box that's still too stark, too closing, but don't close it too much, so you open up the plug bag.

Wow, that was Comedy Backback by Duncan Meek, which I assume is a parody of Duncan Sheik.

Thank you so much, and guys I want to thank you, Nick.

Always great to see you.

God bless you, God bless America.

Hey, I'll take both, and of course Muddy and Miffrin, congratulations.

You're gonna need that to be amputated, I'm pretty sure, but...

I don't think that's allowed.

Do you amputate fingers?

Unfortunately, I don't.

Hold on a second.

Sorry, yeah, yeah, thank you for the show, but yeah, go ahead.

You want me to take this or not?

Yeah, go ahead and take it.

Yes, it's bleeding.

Of course.

That's bleeding.

This is your mother?

Video tapered.

Recorded.

Recorded?

Now masturbate.

What?

To my voice.

As I talk to Scott and Nick...

No.

And the little man from Ireland.

Please don't masturbate to our voices.

I'm really not comfortable with that.

You're me.

No.

It's cold waiting, yes.

Hello?

Waiting makes your noise like that.

It's my Viagra lamp calling.

Okay.

All right, thanks.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.
