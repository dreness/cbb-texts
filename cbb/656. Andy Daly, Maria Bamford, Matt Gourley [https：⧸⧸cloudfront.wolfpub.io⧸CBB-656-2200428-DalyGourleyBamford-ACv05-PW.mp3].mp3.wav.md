If woods and coulds were shants and canes I'd walk on my hands and shit my pants welcome to comedy bang bang.

Oh thank you to the patty cake man for that wonderful catchphrase submission.

Oh the patty cake man I've been thinking about him for years.

Welcome to comedy bang bang for another week another edition.

My name is Scott Ocherman.

Very good to have you here during what is essentially the the weirdest period of time in comedy bang bang history recording all of these remotely with our various guests.

We have an exciting show today we have oh a musician is here also an internet personality and we also have a writer will be here and they're actually all here at the same time.

For those of you who have been listening to the show for many years there's a certain gentleman who has been on the show consistently throughout the 11 years that we have been doing the show.

He is a writer he is a rock on tour certainly not he's not a member of the rock on tours he's not Jack White but he has a collection of poetry that in fact two collections of poetry I believe that are both sold wherever cowboy poetry is sold which I really have no idea where that would be he'll fill us in on this he was a guest here just a few weeks ago actually and he's brought a couple of friends with him and I must admit that I am recording this episode it's safe to say under duress I had no idea that I would be doing this and I got a mysterious message a threatening message which we'll talk about here when they're on the show but please welcome to the show the host co-host and another person who has duties indeterminate upon the show of bananas for bananas a new earwolf podcast please welcome Dalton Wilcox, Mutt Taylor and Amy Sleeverson welcome to the show guys yeah how's it going?

Oh my goodness the Anna's show.

Mutt were you shooting guns into the air what exactly was that?

Yeah I got a pair of six guns here this was my daddy game to me and they're coming to air with me.

Yeah I got a pair of six guns it's a six pack of six shooters and 12 guns for 144 bullets or some shit like that I don't know what a goddamn city slicker you are I can't believe it he says a couple of six shooters you say 12 guns unbelievable that's some city slicking right there I gotta say I do like where he's heading with that I wouldn't mind having 12 guns on me right now 12 guns pointed at you or 12 guns on your person either way I take it either way my friend no but it'd be fun to have 12 holsters on your belt wouldn't it?

I guess I guess it could be like you know the on a clock it has 12 numbers on it just around your waist and you could you could call them out as you shot them you could be like 3 o'clock 6 o'clock instead of chime and bells at 12 p.m.

you shoot 12 times I like this that's true or if your partner who is describing where the bad guys are say you have someone on your six you could reach around to your six and then just fire that one you sure you're a city slicker I'm not sure I guess I you know look my parents were simple country folk so if that grandfathers me into being a country person then I would love that can I back up just a moment and help because you you're in your own domicile you can back wherever you like no I'm talking about conversationally because conversationally yes between you and me Scott everybody know you and I know that it was very difficult for me to get a podcast picked up on the air wolf network and it did involve various forms of coercion and threats against your life and the lives of people you love and your property but I don't want that to be a part of I don't know I don't know which was worse the the threats against my life people who's who my loves lives or my property I couldn't I couldn't quite tell what the worst part of it was I think when you threaten my swimming pool I were gonna like like like the Joker put toxins inside of it or something like that and I had them ready to go I had I had the car loaded up with various toxins to put in the pool and and I know it's gonna put alligators in there too now the alligators would have would have died of the toxins and that'd be a whole other problem now you got bunch of dead alligators but anyways Scott we got to cut all of this and I'm all of this all of it I want you to talk about how excited you are how lucky you were and what a kind of a coup it is for you to have bananas for bananas on your wall now as per when it comes to Amy Sleeverson she is co host it's me the podcast at me and Mutt Taylor and Amy Sleeverson every episode that we have a guest and Amy Sleeverson is a what would you say a Christian entrepreneur right Amy?

I couldn't afford to get into the starting package of Mary and Martha it's $99 who has that and so I started making my own stuff okay so so just I'm also gonna back up conversationally this is a lot like that that movie Pulp Fiction where we're playing with time a little bit but have you ever seen that movie Pulp Fiction? Hill no I mean it takes place in a city but there are guns in it so okay then I've seen it I've seen every movie with guns that takes place in a city it doesn't matter guns super seeds city I don't like city but if it has guns I have to walk it gun beats city in the rock paper scissors of gun city and what's the other one voluptuous okay so city beats voluptuousness but voluptuousness beats gun yeah crazy huh so you've seen every movie with voluptuous women in it as well that's absolutely right okay so I'm gonna back up conversationally so you you don't want us to talk about the the last threatening letter that you sent to me to absolutely that I that I got you on to the show we have to craft a narrative around this Scott and the narrative is gonna be more like oh boy I tried so hard to get Dalton Wilcox to agree to do a podcast and he finally did thank goodness and I want hey I want you to start over from the top with a whole new introduction a whole new introduction that doesn't talk about the the letter that you sent to me with all the letters cut out from your poetry book and I could tell it was from your poetry book because you have you use a very certain font in your poetry book which I haven't really seen in other books cowboy sounds sir if right which which basically like has little gun holsters on that like on the M you know it has like two gun holsters on either either I guess you call them sticks or I don't think they call them sticks but yes every letter has a couple of gun holsters even when you know like a capital I it's hard to get two gun holsters on a capital I is the only letter you can call a stick right that's right before he except after see okay thank you very much so you what so we don't want to talk about that you don't want to talk about the you don't want to talk about the pictures that you included of my loved ones which I don't I still don't even know how you you were able to take those were in the middle of a quarantine right oh I had to break quarantine several times to get these threats across I don't want to talk about all the times that I sat in that one comfortable chair you have in your master bedroom and watched you guys sleep what I don't want to talk about you know the one comfortable chair you have with the footrest you you just got the one you got the bed actually in the dresser you know and then and then you got that one chair I don't know what you need a chair therefore if that's for somebody over watching you while you're convalescing or something I don't know why you'd have a chair but it's comfortable good enough to sit there all night and watch you guys sleep I don't want to talk about it you don't want to talk about that that is bone-chilling how what do I do when I sleep it's not a pretty picture there are several times I was tempted to jump in to try and revive you it was a picture though because he did take pictures and he showed me oh he sometimes he taught you talk you say things you were there too yeah Amy yeah you said at one point you had your hand it was moving and then you said help my hand was moved was I gesturing for someone to help me or really you were having a really important conversation but we didn't know what it was and then you said help oh my god and then you went back to bed so if Dalton was sitting in the comfortable chair Amy where were you during this I was underneath the bed okay so you just were under the bed how did you see the hand then well that's Dalton told me about it and then I heard it okay so you believe everything that Dalton tells you yes he's one of my biggest I've never told a lie in my entire life you've never told a single lie I've never told a single lie in my 520 years on earth I can confirm that I can vouch for that hold on hold on I'm gonna back up conversationally even further 520 years on earth this is something new I don't think we've talked about Dalton no I don't think we have but this is a new discovery of mine I believe I have been alive for 520 years but every every 60 or 70 years or so I blank slate and forget everything that has happened to me it's just something I've begun to read about the history and again there's another thing earwool doesn't want me to talk about monsters so we're gonna have to edit all this out this is part of the new arrangement with the podcast they said don't talk about your monster hunted so I'm happy to cut all this out but I've been reading about the history of the history of monsters and monster hunting and reading about all them uh Dracula's and all that business and how far back all that goes and realizing if anybody's been killing these in the past it must have been me okay so you you think you were born in roughly 1500 approximately eight years after Columbus made his journey here to what turned out to be the United States that's what I believe that's what I've come to believe and I haven't I haven't uh what's the word confirmed it uh scientifically but I believe it's what I've come to believe you've come to believe it okay and that's because you you are for those of you who've never heard Dalton on the show before you are akin to a Van Helsing style monster hunter Van Helsing the movie style I don't know whether that's lore in the actual Dracula canon I have no idea what you're talking about but I am and again we have to cut all this out because the earwool doesn't want me to talk about it they said specifically they say don't talk about all your murdering which is the wrong way to put it I never murdered anybody I have helpfully slaughtered monsters but in addition to being our nation the foremost collector and chronicler of the wit and wisdom of the West I am also plagued by vampires and mummies and frankensteins werewolves so on that's just affected my life it's just something I have to deal with that's part of my burden and now I'm realizing that I think I have been gifted by the infinite if I'm going to fight vampires I'm going to live as long as they do I believe I am going to live until all monsters are eradicated and that's a deal with the universe made with me but every 60 or 70 years or so I forget everything but I believe I've been slaughtering monsters since as you say 15 something that's how we started talking because I sell a set of pillows that do the books of the revelations all 22 chapters and I have one that says it's really cute really beautiful material and well crafted from Thailand is a beast with seven heads and ten horns and ten crowns on his horns and heads his name is a blasphemy emerges from the sea and that's a neck pillow and that's what Dalton said he said oh I think I have killed that okay so this this leads me to three questions Dalton should I take them in order or should I go out of sequence I'd like number two first and then three and then if there's time one okay so number two chronologically would be how many years do you remember at this point and how many years the part B of this question is how many years do you have left before you forget everything that's a great question I would say my earliest memory as of now is about nine years ago and you were on the show 11 years ago well I don't remember that I believe about nine years ago is my earliest memory and I believe before my memory is wiped clean again I have about another 60 years another 60 years so we're at the we're in the nascent stages of your brain activity I caught you 11 years ago at the tail end of every of of the culmination of all of your monster knowledge if you say so okay so chronologically then question three would be are you actually trying to eradicate all monsters do you really want the last monster to die because then you would die and you would no longer be on the surf I hear you well I hear you and that is one of the conflicts that the universe has bestowed upon me I suppose but I do believe yes once I have eradicated all the monsters I will be assumed bodily into heaven where I can you know get laid a lot whenever the hell it is how many virgins are you brother I have no interest in a virgin no you you like the horror of Babylon she's a she's the she's in the Bible Revelation 17 she's the mother of prostitutes and abominations of the earth that kind of more his yeah that's something that I can see you really getting into when you get up there yeah that's the first person I'm gonna look up when I get to heaven I'm gonna say where's the horror of Babylon you could go right to the heavenly white pages and look her up and then you know yeah well just to save time I'd say is she listed under horror or Babylon by the way I just wanted to make clear to you Amy I met Amy in a chat room talking about bananas and she was on there drawing all sorts of important connections between the Bible and bananas oh I see okay so that's Amy how you got involved you met in a bananas a chat room so when you do your new introduction of it you put that in there okay so do should we do that right now should we go back where or do I do I have time for question number one I think you have time okay are chronologically question number one do you think you were Van Helsing one of the original monster hunters I don't know who what is but you're gonna have to do you know what huge or Hugh Jackman is rather first of all let's talk about Hugh Jackman for a second can you really be an actor and have a stage name that's essentially huge Jack man I mean that's a that's really braggy don't you think I'm always thought it was huge back man it might be well we have no idea but you do know who he is you're familiar somewhat with his filmography yeah I've seen him on magazine covers but you must know you you've seen Van Helsing because there are guns in it oh of course yeah he's got a couple of six shooters himself so twelve so so do you think the Dalton might be might be Van Helsing I mean I'll tell you what I know I know you don't know who he is there Dalton but you could be worse things than Van Helsing now this guy was a real badass and I know he's from Germany by way of England or some ship but he's basically a proto cowboy so there's something to find there did he have the sign of the beast nobody had a big hat almost like a witch's hat you never catch me in a get damn witches hat say again come over come back who who are you talking to big good buddy I did mention I'm on a CB right you're on a CB radio right now well yeah now I've been living in my Peter built big rig trucks so my office is like the cab but I live in the trailer okay that's when that's where you've been quarantining so are you on the dirty side right now I'm on the dirty side pickle parked in the shade my friend you know I've got let me let me I'm 10 10 let me tell you something I got all my walls are for lure paintings the entire ceiling of the trailer is a mirror and the entire floor is a water bed Dalton you know thinking about the whole you you were born in 1500 thing it stands to reason that you are not originally from the West that you migrated over here from Europe what are you talking about you son of a bitch I just you know 1492 is when Columbus came over the first kind of white people you know came over from Columbus was from Italy I believe you know it unless you were literally like eight years after he was over here white people you know had immediate sex and then birthed you and I don't think anyone went over to the West for a long time that's what happened he's a product of immediate sex yeah should that go in your bio or maybe a pull quote on the back of one of your books I'm gonna put that in my bio today. Don Wilcox the product of immediate sex is a land of the book put it in as a clause an open incentive there's a macula conception virgin birth and immediate sex and that's how you know you're dealing with someone important that's how we know that don't might be the third coming up really well the second one was sometime in the 70s and it's not a lot of people knew about it but it had something to do with Michael and Michael and oh really the Sam Sun himself from Little House on the Prairie he was he was a hello and bonanza oh I see oh of course bonanza they bring it all back well okay speaking and bringing it all back I feel like I should redo the introduction to this show so engineer Ryan do we have the theme song can we play that again if woods and cuds were a chance and can't I'd walk on my hands and shit it's a good thing.

If woods and cuds were a chance and can't I'd walk on my hands and shit my pants please welcome to comedy bang bang oh I've never said please in that before please welcome to comedy bang bang thank you to the patty cake man for that wonderful catchphrase emission and oh the patty cake man I've been singing about him for years welcome to comedy bang bang my name is Scott ochreman I'm the host of comedy bang bang and we have a wonderful program for you today we have the host and two co-hosts of an intriguing new program here on the ear wolf comedy podcast network bananas for bonanza starring Michael landon Samsung himself from the little house on the Prairie we have the host a writer who has been on the show several times before we have a musician and we have an internet personality please welcome to the show and they are not here under duress I'm not hosting this show under duress at all I am in fact very pleased to have them on the show please welcome Dalton Wilcox, Mutt Taylor and Amy Sleeversen hello guys well thank you Scott that's a wonderful introduction the ponderosa is considered by many Christians to be at what one of the second states of Israel the ponderosa is well yeah okay so that we're taking the taking back to graphically the area that where Christ the third Christ was born I see I see second second Christ and then now now Dalton might be the third right let's go through the Christ's we have of course the original the titular Christ himself JC superstar Jesus he invented the whole game he he started the game and he almost finished it but then he he came back to life went up there to heaven after 30 days or whatever it was what was it a week 30 days how long was he in that tomb three it was three three days three days the rule it's the rule of three in the Bible just like comedy one two and then the kicker so so as soon as the kicker happened he rolled back that stone went up to heaven boy I tell you with a quarantine we've been we've almost been like doing 20 Jesus's we've been under quarantine for like 60 days at this point unbelievable and it's particularly hard when you're completely ignoring the quarantine they have to put up with people looking at you and talking about it are you wearing a mask at least Dalton hell no I'm gonna wear a mask people think I'm trying to rob a train yes so you had Jesus then you have Michael land and then you have what many considered to be the third coming of coming the lord or what do you the lord the lord speaking of lords why why do people want a lord that's such a weird word isn't it I mean I mean obviously we have lords like lord grandtham on downtown abbey I don't know whether you've seen that Dalton I know that but you have because there was a gun in one episode I've seen one episode wait you don't watch the entire series just with the one gun when it comes to episodic television I am only responsible to watch those episodes in which a gun does appear or voluptuousness well yeah a mutt correct me if I'm mistaken but didn't you punch into your dvr the word gun and so it automatically records any show that has a gun that's right I watch that episode with the gun and then as far as voluptuous goes it's a far and few between on down abbey but I did watch that one episode where that lady fucks a turt to death oh yeah you know the one yeah I think I do yeah yeah what about the ones where like uh you know they're changing out of their you know victorian clothes and they're sort of in between outfits you know and they're in you know they're what constitutes is underwear back then is is practically a full outfit for the rest of us it depends on whether or not they're in a whale bone whale bone corset because that'll give you the shape of voluptuous but you take them gals out of them they're just basically just a straight up and down board it's not voluptuous or a cylinder yeah cylinder like a which is the shape the candles that I have on sale in the seven deadly sins they're they're like an hourglass without the little bottleneck part like if you just were gonna have a an hourglass that was good for less than a second the minute you turned it over and it all fell out speaking of an hourglass there there must have been so many episodes of days of our lives that you've seen I mean but there are there are so many subplots with guns there was it wasn't there a guy with a patch yeah patch is yeah oh sure so you see you see all these oh yeah there was one time they got trapped no shit I shit you not in a valentine's day booby trap layer and they had to escape boy now that's that's fine daytime television I watched in the back of my truck I'm sorry did you say a pat an eye patch and a cape I don't know about a cape but patch it was named because he was his actual name yeah I suppose if there was another character that had a cape his name would be Kate man that was a good show do you think that is is cape fear about a guy with a cape it's about a guy afraid of capes so he doesn't have a cape decidedly okay got it now you've seen that obviously because of all the guns involved sure but it's really just a story about a guy who's cold all the time right well um we are of course talking about bananas for bedanza which is a podcast that debuted recently here on the earwolf network now Dalton um we we need to we need to take a break if that's okay but when we come back I don't think it is it's not okay I mean whatever whatever you want to do I'll do obviously Dalton because you're holding all the cards no I'm no no you're more than happy to it's because you like me uh all right Scott I'll tell you what it's all right with me if we take a break uh we are gonna come right back we'll be discussing the show bananas for bonanza with uh it's three personalities here come on back we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this comedy bang bang we are back here with uh Dalton Wilcox from the uh podcast mini series or maxi series I yeah maxi series we're gonna do 431 episodes of this because there was 431 episodes of bonanza and unfortunately that's all they that's all they made somehow tragically they stopped after 400 only 431 episodes but that's how many episodes of bananas for bonanza what are you going to do technically though it is a mini series compared to this show because I've had 650 plus episodes so it's miniature compared to that well but no you're wrong because here's the plan we're gonna do one episode of bananas for bonanza for every one of the 431 episodes of bonanza and then one or two things is gonna happen either number one most likely we will have renewed interest in bonanza to the degree that they begin producing new episodes and we're going to uh uh uh devote new episodes of bananas for bonanza to the new episodes of bonanza or if somehow that doesn't happen we'll just go back to the beginning and we'll and we'll you know we'll redo every episode just start right over okay yeah I mean who would be involved in the new bonanza episodes I mean most of the protagonists or the actors who played the protagonists are have passed on to that uh uh white place up in the up in the clouds with the white pages well uh Scott I haven't thought it through that far but we could do it right here if you like I mean I the only thing I've thought about is that you know because it will be me and mutt and Amy who have repopularized bonanza I wouldn't be surprised if they came to us and said you know will you guys be in the new bonanza and I said you know look I'm not asking for that uh uh you know but I'd consider it I've been writing scripts for the new bonanza show that's inevitably coming our way oh boy did you say Ivan Reitman scripts or just I've been writing scripts I've been writing scripts with Ivan Reitman what the new bonanza yeah he's involved oh yeah he we couldn't keep him away what about something like bonanza colon the next generation you know so yeah so it's possible lorn green has three children well yeah I mean and I forget what comedian it is that said uh bonanza is essentially the story of a 50 year old man and his three 45 year old sons yeah that's right he was eight he had immediate sex lorn green uh was 44 when they made the pilot of bonanza matter of fact and that's just a testament to what an extraordinary actor he was and what an incredibly virile teenager Ben cartwright must have been do you think you could move on to another lorn green project like battle star galactica which in a lot of ways is the prequel to bonanza we've talked about that very thing have you really well yes we have we really have because yeah I mean yeah yeah all of the all of the spaceships are uh named after astrological signs right and that and they're looking down here and populated the earth right yeah that's right it's a prequel series to bonanza wow okay so you might move on to some of those episodes I'm trying to hope for it I've never seen battle star galactica I don't believe it takes place in the west and that's a real deal breaker for me right it does have guns I mean the the silons have guns certainly which is why I think that you've seen it that's right yep silons and the colonials base isn't real space isn't real what no what say more about that well it's not it's someplace that they make up so that maybe you think that oh we have some place to go but we don't this is it is that the same case for Denver the mile high city you that doesn't exist and wow I mean that's in the west yeah I've been there yeah I was in a sex race there yeah you know what now a sex race what is what exactly is that sex race you just try to have sex as quick as you can how what was your time by the way in the time trials I did 14 seconds and I came in fourth place wow so does this mean you have to find someone and then have sex with them or do you come in having found someone to have sex with a to Z you have to locate court copulate and get out so you did that in 14 seconds did you just turn to your left and whoever was there with I mean obviously this must have been someone who was in the competition as well it was it was an immediate connection though I don't want to discount that we did have something the only world you can create outside of yourself is through your hands with shadows and light and it on the wall yeah that's why the arc light if you ever go to an arc light cinema like there's one I believe in Pasadena Dalton that you've been to oh yeah they got a good one in Pasadena before the program starts they have those hands making the hand shadows before the movie starts and that's because the arc light is from what I have heard in rumor is one of the next is especially the one in Pasadena is one of the next is or next I I'm not quite sure of all of the dimensions in the world that one can traverse through oh you're saying the arc light in Pasadena is an interdimensional portal sure yeah and that it's curators anyone who works there like that gentleman who wears all of the snakeskin from head to toe oh cactus Tony yeah cactus Tony yeah they are sort of the your tour guides throughout the dimensions from what I think this is a when this were all the monsters are getting in could be oh maybe that's where the monsters are coming in because I already told you I think I told you well I went to see that movie the Invisible Man and that's where I saw it was at the arc light in Pasadena and I walked in there and the theater was full of Invisible Man's yeah just about just about every seat had an invisible man in it yeah and you and you got them all which you know you collected them all and touched them all um I've never seen that movie you've not seen that yeah that that one uh I can't I feel like there wasn't a was there a gun in it yeah the one of the the guy she's right the guy she's staying with is a police officer yeah and it doesn't the SWAT guys come later on or she yeah yeah she picks up the gun in the rain and yeah yeah you haven't seen the original Claude Raines one oh yeah yeah there weren't guns in that no I defy anyone to post a screenshot of the the original Claude Raines Invisible Man with a gun in it it just does not exist it's like one of those uh baronstein bears kind of things but someone's just going to post a photo of just a gun and say that he's in it that he's holding it yeah and by the way speaking of airplanes the only airplane I've ever been impressed with is the Lisa Marie down there Memphis Grace Land that's is that uh related somehow to Michael Jackson is that kind of like the Lolita Express that that Michael Jackson flew people on or well it's funny that you bring that up because this is something that I know that Michael Jackson he married the airplane that's what he intended to do but it was some kind of a paperwork snafu that he ended up married to a woman he never had any interest in that okay um look we need to take another break if that's okay Dalton let me think about it let me think about it uh um yeah I saw like we're gonna take a break when we come back we're gonna actually I know we didn't do it this segment but we're gonna talk about the format of this bananas for Bonanza show yeah and and uh make sure that everyone listens to it because that is why you guys are here and why I am so pleased to have you guys here and then uh hopefully by the end of the show uh I will receive perhaps some sort of assurance or assurances that uh myself my loved ones and my property will all be left alone oh that that assurance is coming your way right after we wrap on episode 431 of bananas for Bonanza oh my god no and it's conditional on you know where it goes from there oh god okay well look uh we're gonna take a break when we come back we'll have more cut that out okay we'll cut that out don't worry uh more muttated more Amy Sleevers Brian and then part out okay yeah we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang comedy bang bang we are back here uh we have the crew from bananas for bonanza a maxi series podcast uh uh but a fraction of the 431 plus episodes have been released at this point so get in early on the ground floor uh which is a great place to go walk into a house in my opinion the ground floor and then you can go to wherever you like you know the basement the attic uh floor one floor two houses you don't have one level in my opinion ranch style house it got one level and i don't recognize second stories and above got it right so uh townhouses you're not you're not a fan of no i don't if somebody told me a house has a second story i will not go up there yeah i only like a ranch well also a town house a town is kind of a city yeah so yeah right there in the name is something that you don't like but mutt you saw the movie the town yeah i sure did how did you feel about that i mean it's about it's about boston you know one of the biggest got a lot of townhouses so i was a little enraged but then there's so many guns in it so many it just brought me back the the part with all the nuns with guns speaking of which news with guns you must have saw nuns on the run as well oh are you kidding i've seen virtually every nun movie that is the one thing that got grandfathered in when i had to undertake this process okay so sister act two back in the habit big big time i got that on constant repeat flying nun i know that's a television show um bed uh what about uh uh bed knobs and broomsticks speaking of flying things yeah yeah sound of music yeah i mean those nazis have guns right there yeah what's that horror movie recently la laura rona or is that the one with the none with the i saw her on a bus stop thing and then i had oh is that part of the conjuring verse i believe so yeah right so maybe one of the only movies you haven't seen is that movie with the train coming towards camera because there are no guns in that no and i've never seen the one with the moon getting poked in the eye i mean i've seen it with a rocket because i know how to refer to it and that's the whole movie but i've never sat down to watch it right okay the one that well lumi air is that who made that one or yeah i think you're right i saw that uh what's that martin scorsese movie maybe you haven't seen it because i can't think of a gun in it but boratt is in it i have not seen it she's i go to the internet movie gun database gun database gun database oh gun oh gun and none database i'll check before i watch any movie oh i see yeah hugo has no guns although i believe the the boratt train guard probably has a gun in a holster when he's chasing hugo but uh i believe it's a night stick oh it's a night so okay so that was on the internet gun database that no i was on the internet movie night stick database okay it said you may get tricked into thinking this is a gun but it is not it's a night stick it's not enough to check about the guns you got to check about night sticks so you don't get double crossed correct i wish you had seen it because i have an opinion on that movie which was i believe it's scorsese's tribute to the cinema oh and i i've i've never found anyone to back me up on that claim have you ever found anyone to disagree i've no because no one's seen it i don't agree i don't think that's anything like what you said do you know who martin scorsese is hell no sounds like he's from europe well he's is is he's talking about generationally certainly from italy yeah lumea scorsese a no thank you but will cocks what kind of the name is that what kind of a question is that will cocks is a name of the west it's a western name you're you're uh i mean your ancestors you know how most names were derived from whatever job someone had or you know place in society um what do you think your ancestors did did they were they like legal zoom where life meets legal where uh they made wills and living trusts or were they cocksmen i can't believe what an ignorant question you're asking me the name will cocks is descended from people who would leave their cocks to their descendants and their wills how many cocks do you have will by now i've accumulated hundreds of dozens of hundreds of cocks from my ancestors and they're in various forms they're mounted some of them are mounted on the wall some of them are preserved in uh they're pickled pickled in a in a jar and uh those are and i have a whole separate house full of those this reminds me of another friend of mine who was leaving his cock in his will to mitt romney i think we talked about him recently oh i know who you mean yeah don't want to say yeah we don't want to say the phrase that conjures him oh no we don't know that'll be pain in the ass andy man no we don't want to raise the candy man either candy man no it's not yeah no it's it's akin to the candy man oh god we've said it like oh shit oh who's house is he at i'm not gonna look behind me i thought it was the andy man oh so we're only at four okay all right but you know he could be in this i'm not in my own house i don't have uh the internet in my own ranch yeah where are you exactly well i have normally used the internet at my local library but uh it's closed now for god knows what reason so i've been having to for the purposes of talking to people on podcasts i've been having to break into the homes of people who have internet and uh it's hard because so many of them are home now don't so have what in all your uh monster hunting have you ever come across a candy man's uh i i have uh not that i'm aware of but now you guys are making me very concerned about a candy man what how do you know what candy man when you see one well he's got a hook for a hand he's covered in bees yeah uh oh yeah i've seen a few of those okay that's that's ringing a bell that description yeah yeah i've seen that i've seen a few of them okay okay yeah yeah oh just candy have anything to do with a candy man lore like does he does he pass out candy or yeah he's got like three different parallel myths i could never quite keep it straight i forget what the candy well i mean those are two by the way two totally separate distinct accidents to have one having your hand cut off and two having bees cover your entire body yeah i i think he was a former slave that they poured honey on and then the bees ate his head and then i don't know how he got a hook for a hand i want saw a guy with a beard of bees a beard of bees really where was this uh it was at a state fair there's a fellow there with a beard of bees and i figured that i don't know what kind of monster that is but it's a some kind of a one and so uh i i shot him with a silver bullet straight through the heart and so now i understand it sounds like i must have killed a candy man that they did all of the bees fly off of his beard uh after he was killed or did you kill all of the bees individually as well what ended up happening was that he had an actual beard that he had just covered in some of the bees cared about and so uh after a while they dispersed and i i grabbed as much of them as i could with my fists to try and squeeze them to death turns out people don't know this uh bee uh has some something in them it can hurt your hand if you squeeze no no people people actually do know that don't actually the beard of bees is one of this after the seven seals are open and a white horse is but don't add so many different layers to the story beyond just the horses he has so many other things going on that weren't told about in in the revelation book so i just have to keep writing it down and and squeeze it and then to my right oh so you're you're writing a newer testament will it be called the newest testament or the newer testament or well it's like i've made it's there a little bit of a rewrite so that it's more kind of more fun and upbeat but that actually says real life examples of it happening like beard of bees i see you know that new testament at this point it's two thousand years old like it's so old at this point plus can we stop getting so upset about spoilers from the bible this thing is two thousand years old if you haven't read it by now then you know come on yeah yes that's exactly i mean we all know that the seven spiritual figures are the third whoa oh come on i did not know that when are you going to finally get around to reading it mud i was pair i was a paragraph or what do you call them synopsis synopsis no i guess paragraphs in the bible goes paragraph scripture line whatever i was like seven paragraph verses seven verses away from that he got to the part with a lamb stands on Mount Zion oh no i was thinking he was not going to get up there oh it's so fun hell i'm sorry speaking of verses speaking of verses mud you've seen aliens versus predator oh i seen both of them right yeah whoever wins we lose definitely oh god but we all win because what a movie what a couple of movies because the predator predator has a gun yeah oh yeah alien is is defenseless and unarmed but voluptuous certainly especially that queen oh oh boy oh i i kind of feel like it's an unfair fight for whom well for the alien because i mean give the alien a gun and then suddenly like we're on even ground you know but i mean he could learn to fish sure teach an alien to fish you've taught one alien to fish you're right now that predator's got some kind of thermal heat vision and i don't know what kind of temperatures them uh zenomorz run at but maybe he can't see him so they could sneak up on him like an invisible man's those xenomorz who who designed them oh he's a guy named HR Giger i believe yeah HR Giger was he the guy who didn't he designed the cover to Deborah Harry's first solo album and the microphone stands for the band corn okay right interesting guy yeah real interesting give a zina form a fish and you've just destroyed your market base that's true is that a spoiler no so so are you uh uh amy i have to ask you about your your newest testament um are you essentially just writing what happens after revelation after the rapture it's all of what Dalton tells me of his monsters and this is sick okay okay then what happened because he adult what from what i understand from what Dalton's told me he is the forthcoming wait Dalton is the forthcoming yeah who's the third i thought he was the third was michael landon well that who's the second oh no oh no oh no you messed it all up it goes oh we we and we listed them earlier uh oh i'm sorry it goes jc himself jc michael landon michael landon then he's the third coming he's the third coming real three real three yeah the kicker dik sergeant sure they shared one okay Dalton do you have an opinion on that i mean like obviously amy is writing uh this newest testament uh that stars you i guess uh-uh look i'll be honest i've i've been gone for the past few minutes i've wait where do where'd you go well here's the thing i'm in the i'm in the garage of a house in my nearby me and uh the family is wait nearby you you're you're in it it's like the most nearby you can get i'm saying that this how well right no i know what you mean but nearby where i live like gosh it journalism it's a long story this thing has been real hard i had to steal a computer from the last house i broke into which luckily had a mummy in it and i was able to kill him oh i had to take his computer and and hit the road and now i'm in the garage of another house and the family is in there and they just came out here and was hassling me about what are you doing in our garage you know that's nothing so it it was a real mess but uh uh anyway i'm back now i just had to deal with that oh how did you guys were talking about i'm how did you actually deal with it did i mean or did you find out the family were a bunch of monsters as well it's funny you should say that because i obviously i don't i don't link to any conclusions about anything ever in my life but i was trying to talk some sense into them just like i know these are regular people who live in a house and have some understandable concern about somebody being in their garage but we can settle this and as they became increasingly unreasonable i began to suspect that they was actually creatures from the black lagoon the two of the husband and wife so i just asked them and then they said we're creature from the black lagoons yep they said they were creatures from well i assumed they were probably from two different black lagoons then they met somewhere else i say but anyways uh when they didn't come right out and say the words you know they never do but i asked them are you creatures from the black lagoon and you know they basically not in so many words but more or less confirm it and i have to you know take care of them you can take the creature out of the lagoon but you can't often take the lagoon out of the creature am i right hey don't know yeah you ever what do you do when you come across a monster truck this has got to be a conundrum for you well it's extremely difficult i believe it or not the only way to kill a monster truck is to drown it and i've been in that situation many times well you can't shoot them and a stake through the heart didn't go to work so you got to neutralize the driver of the truck which is usually some kind of a monster himself and then you got to drive the truck into some kind of a body of water would would you ever drive a monster truck into a black lagoon it seems like you'd be getting into a heap of trouble there well i have had it to happen there have been times where i have had to drive a monster truck into a black lagoon and that's fine as long as you get out of there fast before what if you drown at you and drink a monster truck in monster energy drink uh yeah well i'm very concerned about monster energy drink you know i have that go fund me uh yeah to go out and purchase up all the monster energy drink i can and destroy it because we don't want to be giving monsters any more energy my friend right and that that go fund me has a goal of several million dollars and i haven't checked in with it in a while oh you really should have part i mean that seems like the kind of thing you yeah it seems like the kind of thing like daily if not hourly i would be checking in on to make sure you know if there's a million dollars on the line well i'll be honest with you i forgot the website address name for go fund me you guys go fund me dot com thank you you guys my husband wants me to make him lunch i have to go make my husband's lunch and i i but i do want to i'm going to send you a sample of my dish towels dish towels that could clean up all the monsters you just destroyed and they're um they're sloth and envy are the first the two dish towels that i'm featuring on my website last night or this this week okay well i'm sorry you have to go Amy it's been a pleasure talking to you we're just about done with the show but uh your husband it seems like he takes uh he loves this egg salad all right Amy thanks it's uh so nice to meet you good luck with the show but speaking of the show we uh i i promised we would talk about it we would say what the format of of bananas for bonanza is what exactly is it Dalton that doesn't take too long what we do is we're bringing a guest and we we talk about an episode of bananas for bonanza and we show some clips of it and we talk about an episode of bananas for bonanza hey don't be a smart ass you just said it no i didn't we talk about an episode of bonanza you didn't you didn't tell them right on bananas for bonanza and we just talk about it for the full hour and we show some clips from it and we take a deep dive in each episode and that's it and there was going to be a whole bunch of other features of the podcast but we don't have time for it because we was going to do poetry contests prank phone calls we didn't have time for any of it it's it's oh we got our hands full analyzing an episode of bonanza you were going to do like a jerky boys which by the way the jerky boys movie but you've seen obviously because of the whole gangster subplot in it uh oh yeah or a cranky anchors type prank phone calls well we know what in addition to bananas for bonanza which is on earwold also on stitches we have uh bonus episodes bonan bonanas bonus bonas for bonasanza bonanas for bonanza bonus bonas bonanas for bonanza okay is every other week on stitches coming out and on that we answer questions but what not do from people any kind of questions that they have and uh we're thinking about that's maybe where we're going to do our prank phone calls and that would be we'd be calling city slickers and asking them how to hogtie a cattle and fun stuff like that okay great well uh you know this uh you describing this show actually uh leads me to uh realize that we are just about out of time and but we have one final feature on the show uh which this is the perfect segue uh it's time for something a little something called plugs this this this this is real this this is hot damn this this this this this this is a little something called plugs all right that was a little something by bricks and stone thank you to bricks and stone uh all right so uh obviously uh i would be remiss uh and i'm certainly not under duress when i uh say that we should be plugging bonanas for bonanza which is out now wherever podcasts uh are obtained yep wherever they cast them you can find it it's also available at be dalton under audio books and uh are you related to are you related to be dalton uh in as far as a man can be related to a store yes i believe i did you inherit a cock from be dalton well uh yes i am in possession of be dalton's cock and i didn't want to say that because i don't want people going crazy and coming over my house to get a look at it but it is everything you've heard it is uh but anyway yeah you got to listen to bananas for bonanza as well as the bonus bananas for bonanza episode as well as by the way i am featured on an on a new album called four more sweaters monsters take your questions that's a new album on a special thing records and i'm part of that album people should buy that i see and that uh four four more sweaters that is uh currently out people
