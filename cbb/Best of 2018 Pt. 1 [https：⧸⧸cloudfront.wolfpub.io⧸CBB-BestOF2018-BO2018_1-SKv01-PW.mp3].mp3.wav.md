♪♪♪ Reese's Pieces for All My Nieces and a Curfew or Two from an FU Get to Bed Kid, welcome to Company Bang Bang.

Mmm, that one doesn't work.

It does not work, I think.

It's Reese's Pieces.

I know.

That's how it's pronounced.

Reese's Pieces.

And I think there's also, they were trying to go for an internal rind of curfew and nephew, which also doesn't work.

Nerf you.

Do you think Medill wrote this?

What time does that clerk say?

Oh.

Good afternoon.

But thank you to Reese Makes Words for that wonderful catchphrase submission.

And welcome to the show.

This is Comedy Bang Bang for- Thank you.

And I'm speaking to you, of course, personally, and now let me talk to the listeners out there, if I may.

They might guess.

Thank you for listening to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

Pull my manners to the test.

All right.

By the way, Paul F. Tonkin's here has turned into a talking spoon.

This is the time between the last episode.

This is not great.

Because, I mean, first of all, the spoon, would you agree that the spoon is the least used item of cutlery?

I wish I could say that's true.

Really?

People are using me to stir and scoop all manner of things.

But that is primarily a spoon's bailiwick, is it not?

Well, yes, but I've never been a spoon before.

How did this happen to you?

I was doing cocaine with a genie.

Just one of those crazy things.

I made fun of his coke spoon and he turned me into one.

Oh, no.

Wait.

So you're a coke spoon?

I'm a big coke spoon.

Oh, OK.

So when you say you was very big.

When you say all manner of things, you primarily mean cocaine.

Yeah.

Meow.

Wait.

Did that genie just turn you into a cat?

How great was I dream of genie?

The creators of that realized that the word genie was a homonym.

For the name genie.

Yeah.

That's a show.

It's perfect.

And then how disappointed were the creators of Bewitched, who were like, Bewitched isn't a name.

No, which isn't a name.

Which isn't a name.

Sorcerer's is not a name.

But then I dream of genie and pardon me for anyone who's under 100 years old.

But why was he an astronaut?

Like, if you were creating that show, is an astronaut just a man of science or was it everyone who was a man of science.

And so that magical, magical being would be the dichotomy there.

I think you're giving it a lot of credit.

And I think it was just because astronauts were popular at the time.

They were popular in the six.

Because there was the beginning of the space program.

And you were very excited.

Great show.

And also very little other than the original finding of the genie bottle.

How did I never recall?

Very little of his career had to do with space.

He was mostly just in the Air Force and worked at an office.

He was an astronaut though, correct?

Absolutely.

Did he travel to the moon and beyond?

I don't remember.

And back?

I don't remember if he traveled to the moon beyond and back.

Or if it was a flight that was aborted.

Like I remember in the opening animation, his space capsule, it falls down on an island.

Oh, that's right.

And that's where he discovers the ball.

So he's a failed astronaut.

Yeah, I guess.

Who never made it out into space.

Instead, got onto an island.

Yeah.

Finds it.

Instead, he got onto an island.

Which anyone could do.

I guess.

Could be an astronaut to do that.

I mean, you know, in one way, it's an efficient way of travel.

If you need to get to that island.

True.

Go out into space and then.

Much like the incompetent Gilligan, he did not go their own purpose.

That is true.

You know, my father who worked in the aerospace industry told me at one point that he believes that is the next step in travel is high-speed flights that go up into the atmosphere.

They're like rockets that go up and then they come down after the Earth's rotation rotates a little bit onto wherever you need to go and it'll take a fraction of the time.

That's interesting.

Yes.

Does that come to pass yet?

I mean, he told me this approximately three years ago.

So.

Three years ago.

Yes.

Wow.

So he's still thinking about it.

He's still thinking about it.

He retired from the industry and I believe he still keeps up with it.

Now he's a professional poker player.

That's right.

He is all in.

I feel like any shows about islands, people go there by mistake and the only lost Gilligan's island.

Right.

The only one I could think of where people went there on purpose is fantasy island.

Yeah.

But come on.

Can you think of another show where it's like, watch these characters as they vacation on Hawaii?

I mean, it's.

Hi.

Oh, hi.

Welcome to the show.

Thank you again.

This is a very special episode.

This is best of comedy bang bang part one.

Of 2018.

Well, yes, of 2018.

Did I say not of what is best of comedy bang bang?

Correct.

You're right.

It could be any year.

Maybe I don't want to mislead the audience.

Maybe we will do that some year where perhaps even for the 10th anniversary of do best of the entire 10 years.

Can you fucking imagine?

Fucking imagine.

Can you fucking imagine?

Imagine.

Fucking imagine.

Yeah.

Kind of faking.

Oh, no, the genie turned this into babies.

Oh, baby, genie, no baby.

Oh, baby, genie.

You baby.

Best of.

Whoa.

Did you just call for was that a laugh?

Maybe a little bit of a.

Clap.

Clost.

This is best of comedy bang bang 2018 part one of four.

So over the next couple of weeks today, of course, is Christmas Eve Monday and then we'll put out part two on Thursday the following week, New Year's Eve part three, and then the following Thursday part four, we will wrap it all up with your top episodes.

We are counting down the top 14 this year.

Paul, are you excited?

The top of so I'm very excited, Scott.

This has been a great year for comedy bang bang.

Yes, it has.

And we'll see exactly how many of your episodes make it on the list.

What how many how many do you think might end up there?

One.

Which one?

Maybe.

I don't know.

One somebody famous is not on you.

Oh, Paul.

We'll see.

We'll see if you're going to be the.

Pleasantly surprised.

Pleasantly surprised or whatever.

Or just a biobly disappointed.

To fly into a right.

I will fly into a right.

Paul F.

Smash.

I'm just talking about your favorite TV shows.

What else?

I love smash.

I know you love smash and never watch it.

Remember how important it was to.

You never watched it?

I never saw it.

That's right in my alley.

Instead I watched.

It is right up your alley.

I watched the Josh Radner one that came out this year.

Well, I don't even know what it's called.

He's like a teacher or something.

He's a teacher who's who gets so excited about spring awakening.

The show that he decides he's going to go in there and oust the drama teacher and campaign for a job.

And then he goes in there and starts, you know, directing this musical spring awakening.

Is that true?

That is very true.

Wow.

Maybe he didn't do it.

Smash.

He didn't do it.

He's right up your alley.

Well, I watched it.

Of course, RIP is no longer with this, but I watched it until I could try their dice.

Stomach it no longer.

What's that?

Josh Radner died.

Josh Radner is dead.

Oh, I hope he doesn't die between the recording and this episode.

We say RB for the show.

I'm praying for Josh Radner.

The same way I pray for the notorious RBJ.

Josh, RBJG.

JG.

Josh, we're pulling for you.

We want you to survive.

Hang in there.

Hang in there, Josh.

And perhaps your next project will.

One of the, here's, may I entice you to seek out smash and watch it?

There's only two seasons.

How would one seek it out and then watch it?

It's gotta be, it's gotta be.

It's gotta be.

It's tamable on like an NBC app or something.

Sure.

We should have watched the first season.

Oh, really?

So you're telling me to watch two seasons.

You only watched one?

I'll watch the second season if you will.

Okay.

In the same room?

But you must watch whatever you want.

Oh, two rooms like Bernie Taplin and the hell.

We're two rooms watching at the same time.

At the exact same time.

I used to do that on planes.

Occasionally, Akiva Shaffer and I would go take trips together.

And we insisted on drinking the same things, eating the exact same meal, and watching the exact same movie and pressing play at the exact same time.

And if we ever paused it, pausing it at the exact same time.

So we could have the exact experience while wearing headphones.

Sure.

That's fun.

It was a lot of fun.

I guess.

It's rigid fun.

Well, isn't smash the first season.

One of the subplots is the, you know, Deborah Messing is married to Brian.

T.V. Grace?

Yeah, T.V. Grace.

And not Grace Under Fire.

And the stories of Emily.

What was the name of the other show?

The Mysteries of Laura.

Oh, yes.

Yes.

That's right.

T.V. Grace and Laura.

She had two failed shows before just going, I give up.

Back to the grind.

Back to the Grace.

Back to the Grace grind.

So she's married to Brian Darcy.

I almost said Brian Darcy Carden.

But he's a Broadway actor.

Very prominent eyebrows.

Right there.

Whereabouts in the middle of his head?

Like kind of like, like, two thirds up.

Where eyes are, but like over, yeah, between, between his hairline and his eyes.

Between his ears?

Yeah.

But the other way.

The other way.

Horizontal.

You consider ears to be vertical.

Yes.

Don't you?

So what parts of the body are vertical and what parts are horizontal?

Scott, you've fallen into my trap.

Oh no.

Here we go.

Ears and nose.

Ears and nose vertical.

Ears and mouth.

Horizontal.

Arms and legs.

Vertical.

Chest.

Horizontal.

The belly button.

It better be horizontal.

You think a belly button is horizontal?

I don't because it's part of the landscape of the belly.

I think it's vertical.

Then that sounds like an outy to me.

Belly buttons are not completely circular.

I believe they are popular and I believe they are vertical.

Well, they're not.

They take ears out.

You have your beliefs.

Here's mine.

Sorry about the noise.

That is vertical AF, my friend.

Thank you.

Daphne.

Did I win?

So about penis, obviously vertical.

What about penis?

That shows.

The vajoon.

Vertical.

Unless.

You know the older religion has it.

What is that?

I don't know this.

Oh, Scott, I'll tell you off Mike.

Oh boy.

Let's turn them off right now.

Click.

Oh girl.

What do you know they say that men's vaginas go the other way?

They go side to side.

Think you're talking about a butthole.

Think you're talking about it.

Think you're talking about a butthole.

Hey.

Think you're talking about a butthole.

It's me, Eugene Cordaro.

Hey.

What's my name?

It's me.

Carl Tarte.

We'll hear a little bit of that later.

Let's turn the mic back on.

Click.

So in Smaish, one of the subplots is.

You know.

Deborah Messing, Mary to this dude.

Deborah Messing, dude.

She's married to this dude.

They have a son who's in high school.

Seems like he's 40 years old.

He was also in the movie Brooklyn with.

Sheer, sheerauded.

What is Brooklyn again?

Is that.

It's a movie about Brooklyn.

Is it the movie where the Irish person comes over?

Yes.

The movie where the Irish person comes over.

With the.

Sheer, sheerauded.

Sheer, sheer, sheer, sheer, sheer, sheer, sheer, sheerronin.

Yes.

I did see it.

Sheer, sheerronin.

Sheer, sheer, sheerronin.

It's so great.

That is a movie, by the way, that my mother liked so much she bought on Blu-ray.

Now she doesn't have a lot of Blu-rays, but that one.

Ooh.

She wanted to watch it again and again.

That's right up in Old Mom's alley.

I promise she has never watched it nor taken it out of the package.

She forgets that she has it.

So, you know, Deborah Messings is going to, she's mulling whether or not to go back to work to write another Smash Broadway.

So she is a Broadway liberalist?

She's a Broadway Smashmaker.

Yeah, she works with this other guy, and I think she does the lyrics and he does the music, I think.

So she writes the.

Songs.

That make the.

Whole.

World.

Sing.

Do you have a similar distaste for not to get too off track, but for the music of the early 70s and mid 70s?

No, I don't.

Really?

I mean, I don't.

I think because I'm a little bit older than you.

I guess I mean those particular the schmaltzy elevator-ish.

Barry Mavilowich.

Yeah, I guess like a love-hate thing, because there is something that's somewhat comforting about them.

I don't like them as songs, necessarily.

What about like, Hey, won't you play another somebody dance somebody round song?

Make me feel it home.

Cos I miss my baby.

While I miss my baby.

Is it wild?

I'm going to be, make me feel at home while I miss my baby.

Make me feel at home while I miss my baby.

Here's my agenda for today.

Missing my baby.

And someone.

And it can be feel.

I'm going to be out and about.

So if you can make me feel at home while I miss my baby.

Is he doing errands during this song?

Yeah, he's multitasking.

He's driving all around, picking up prescriptions.

He's dropping off a dry cleaning.

Oh, Manjone.

Why don't you drop off a dry cleaning?

Chuck Manjone.

Ah, Chuck Manjone.

Feels so good.

Now that's a great song.

What song is that?

How's that go?

It's an instrumental.

Okay.

He was the king of the trumpet instrumentals, was he not?

He was the king of the trumpet instrumentals.

What's another one of his- 1929.

The world on the brink of disaster.

But Chuck Manjone was entertaining everyone.

Into the grave.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Didn't he do- Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

That feels so good.

Yeah.

Oh, is that feel so good?

I thought I was doing the prices right theme there for a second.

There's some overlap.

Blah, blah, blah, blah.

There's some overlap.

That would be a great mashup.

Oh, Hulk mashup.

Why isn't there a DJ who wears a big Hulk head?

Yes, DJ.

And the Hulk head.

It's Hulk mashup.

Every song.

God, why are we giving away this idea?

That's true.

We could be the new doft punk.

We could both be that DJ.

Right.

I did hear- Because if you wear a mask.

I did hear about Daph Punk that they- When they play live or do any sort of promotional appearance be in a video or anything.

It is never them.

That makes sense.

It is always just like two random dudes that they hire to do this all the time.

Why not?

That's the advantage of wearing a mask.

This is the advantage of wearing a mask.

I also heard Mike Myers on Halloween when he kills all those people.

Not him.

Just somebody hires.

He kills some of the people.

No, he's never killed anyone.

And he's gone to insane asylums for it.

He will just keep that secret to the grave.

I've heard that and this is timely.

If you see Santa Claus in the department store.

Sure.

That's one of his helpers.

Really?

Yeah.

It's not really him.

So if you tug on his beard and you see it's fake.

He'll tell you that he's one of his helpers instead of the actual Santa Claus.

He has to tell you that.

Oh man.

Yeah.

Is that like- Even if his beard is real.

Being a member of Kiss, they have not toured since the 70s.

Why?

Because they've just put other people into those into the makeup.

Oh, I thought it was because their music is dumb and no one wanted to hear it.

Ha ha, how dare you.

How dare me.

Tell me about Debra Messle.

Science?

So they have the son.

She's like, I'm going to have to go back to work, I think.

And he's 40 and- And then the son is very- He's very upset because they had been mulling adopting a child.

The son is upset?

Because they were- The high school son is furious that now the plans to adopt a second child are on hold.

Why would the son care?

Exactly!

The son who's in- It's not like, oh, I've always wanted a little brother.

Yeah, exactly!

I'm three years old and I've always wanted a little- Exactly!

Or even like to five.

Yeah.

Imagine this kid who sounds like a full girl, like a middle-aged man saying- 17 year old.

Well, I thought you were going to give me a baby sister.

What happened?

Hey!

Hey, Debra.

Hey, Deb.

Hey, Deb, Deb, Deb, whoa, whoa, whoa, sit down a second.

Let's talk.

Hey, you remember we discussed this.

You said you were going to give me a baby, brother.

Baby sister.

We were going to do it as a family.

We agree.

No, I got trigonometry in the morning.

You think I want to do what they- Shit!

So that passed through network notes and made it all the way onto TV.

It was a running subplot.

That this was the entirety of the season.

Yes.

That was one of the things that made her life difficult with Sarah's.

Her son was mad.

Her son was mad that your top shit plans are on hold.

This sounds great.

I got to watch it now.

You should watch it.

There's a lot about it that's extremely insane.

Fake musical or real musical?

What are the- She's writing a new musical?

Is that what it is?

She's writing a new musical about adoption.

It's called Bombshell.

It's not about adoption.

That probably would have appeased the sun a little bit.

Oh, wait.

Is it about Marilyn Monroe?

Yes, it is about me.

Oh, okay.

The most- A topic we've hardly talked about.

We barely scratched the surface.

Why do people like Marilyn Monroe?

I've tried to figure this out.

I mean, she- Yeah, she was in a few movies, and I like her in some like it hot.

That's maybe the only- No, I've seen Seven-Year- Rich.

It didn't like her in that, but- But was it just because- Out of Mary and Millionaire?

Ever see her in that?

I have not.

She's very good.

Okay, but so she made like a random three movies.

Yes.

Is it just the poster?

She made a random three movies.

That seems like about all she did.

That was her body of work, right?

No, she had- She made quite a few movies, and she's actually- I know exactly what you mean, because I am not terribly familiar with her.

And then recently, Jamie was watching How to Mary and Millionaire.

Okay.

And is that the one?

Yeah, with Lauren Bacall and Betty Grebel.

Okay.

And then I started watching it with her, and Marilyn Monroe's undeniably charming and attractive.

Like you cannot help but like her and fall in love with her.

Okay.

I mean- I mean- Even- Even- She was a movie star.

But- But she was a movie star-ster, but I guess what I mean to say is, what is this fascination 50 years on with her?

You know, it's like, you know, no one is going to be writing a musical in 50 years about Shurshah Ronan.

Well, Scott, you're a troubled live.

She- Okay.

She- So did Shurshah!

She- Did she?

She- I don't know.

She okay?

Or- Or- Okay, let me give you a different example.

One of years old?

Writing a musical about Josh Radner, RIP.

I know.

Well, a little too soon.

I think we have to wait.

And look at his legend.

Did Marilyn Monroe drown?

She's not true.

What did she- Well, there's some conjecture!

Car crash?

Well, it was not a car crash.

She was supposedly an overdose of pills.

Okay, but leading to her drowning in a car?

She's not drowning in a car.

She just in a bed, really?

Just like, or on a toilet, Elvis style or what?

I believe in a bed.

In a bed.

I believe in a bed.

Okay, good, good.

I- People should- I mean, I don't know.

People should die in beds.

It always bumps me out- These bull should die in beds.

It always bumps me out, like hearing about people who come into their house and find their loved one, like on a floor.

I think that's why the grandparents and Charlie and the chocolate factory stayed in bed the whole time.

Always stayed in bed because they know they're like just about to go.

Yeah, we're so old.

What are we doing?

We're going to walk around.

What I'm going to drop dead at the store.

Get me a bedpan.

Can you want to die on the toilet, like Elvis Presley?

I want to have some dignity.

Get me a bedpan.

Did Jim Morrison also- And I apologize, this is a quite a morbid topic, but bathtub for him?

I believe bathtub for- Bathtub for you!

No toilet for you?

No toilet for you.

The toilet Nazi would not let him die on a toilet.

Big sign, felt fan, Paul?

Oh boy, what holds up better?

There is something that's very- What I think of- Like I watched it when it was on and really enjoyed it.

As when I think of it now, it seems like a very cold and remote thing to me that I do not want to revisit at all.

I bet it still holds up.

I have not watched- For a lot of people it does!

I bet it does.

People like to celebrate Festivus.

Now it's time for the- A festival for the rest of us.

A festival for the rest of us.

Speaking of the holidays though, today is Christmas Eve.

Do you have Christmas plans?

Nope.

Just going to- See what happens.

Just going to wake up.

Hope that old fat man traveled down my chimney.

If not, see you next year.

Yeah, if I don't get presents from Santa Claus this year, I don't know what I'm going to do.

I'm keeping it open.

Just keeping your options open.

Yeah!

Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Because if I do get presents- Okay.

If I do get presents, of course, I'm going to spend all day opening them.

Of course.

How many presents do you usually get from Santa?

Ooh.

It's in the high hundreds?

High hundreds!

Yeah.

Nine hundred and fifty or so?

Okay, yes.

Oh my gosh.

I entered your 51.

Santa gives you that many- Are they all small presents that cost like a dollar?

No, it's a wide variety.

It's a wide array.

Sometimes they get multiple bikes.

Multiple bikes!

I got a swimming pool slide once.

Do you have a swimming pool?

Nope.

Hoping this year.

Santa's going to bring you a swimming pool?

I hope so.

Why not?

What would that be?

That's beyond his powers?

You would- How would that work?

You would go into your backyard, see a giant hole in the ground with wrapping paper.

Yeah, big boat!

Like a car- Like a brand new carbo, but even bigger.

Just don't step into it, because I fear you would plunge right through the paper and- Somebody, I can't remember- Her your little butt!

I can't remember who it was.

Somebody on Twitter, and I retweeted it.

Like, talked about the- how- I guess there's this world out there where people are getting new cars for Christmas all the time.

Oh, new world!

Don't you dare shut the door!

Oh, new world!

I'm gonna kick you in the face.

I gave cool up a new car once.

No, that's very nice.

Put a nice little bow on it.

Did you do a little bow?

Yeah, well, it was little.

I couldn't get- I couldn't find one of those big car ones.

Did you do one of the regular bows like you put it on?

It was in the grill.

I put it in the grill.

Whoo!

But that's the one that you would put on a wrap- Yeah, exactly.

But these commercials every year- Every year people are getting new cars.

Jesus Christ!

When's a- You have a new-ish car, right?

How old is yours?

It's yours.

2011!

Yeah.

Very good.

Mine is 2008.

2008 and still only 50,000 miles.

Why trade it in?

Mine has 30 miles on it.

30!

Yeah.

So you don't drive it here or- I don't drive it here.

Where do you- I take a limousine here.

What I do is I drive it back and forth in the driveway.

Just to feel some freedom.

Just to feel powerful like a man.

Well, you know, because I'm- I'm- I have security detail that protect me at all times.

Sure.

They'll never let me drive around town.

Of course.

I noticed them tasting your food as well.

They're not supposed to be doing that.

They're just eating my food.

Oh no.

Sorry guys.

That didn't mean the world was your spot.

Thank you for- Are you ever telling me?

Oh no, you're not going to fire them.

Not on Christmas Eve, Paul!

I'm going to fire them on Christmas Day.

Oh no!

Old man Tomkins!

So they had to tell their families- If they look around the table and say, I just got a text message I'm fired.

By text!

Wow.

You're not going to go to their house on Christmas Day.

No, how can I get there?

My security details all with their families.

You've given them the day off though.

Yeah!

To get fired!

I would love that.

Like Ebenezer Scrooge, that was his move, where he's like, Bob, graduate?

Sure, take Christmas Day off.

Go ahead.

You know what Bob, Patrick, you're right.

You should take Christmas Day off.

And then text him.

You're fired.

And then a sad emoji.

What's this a gift from Mr. Scrooge?

A mobile telephone?

Let me just set it up.

Yeah.

I mean, that's the way to do it.

You get somebody a brand new phone.

Just to text them, you're fine.

Just to text.

Power move, I love it.

Power move, power bottom!

I mean, you're Scrooge.

Famous power buff.

Famous!

Ebenezer Scrooge.

The rankings of Dickens characters.

Okay, you got Oliver Twist.

Oliver Twist is top for sure.

I definitely.

Please, our guy wants some more.

You know what I mean?

David Topperfield.

It's right there in the name.

Don't get top of your than that.

But famous power bottom!

Famous power bottom!

Ebenezer Scrooge.

JD Power bottom and associates.

Have right definition Scrooge.

Notorious power bottom.

Hey, is it cold in here?

Because it's Christmas time.

Are you cold or are you warm?

I'm not cold.

I'm okay.

I'm gonna tough it out.

You're gonna tough it out.

You have a jacket.

You know what it is?

I have a jacket.

I have a vest.

I feel it on my biceps.

You feel the chill of Christmas?

I feel the chill on my biceps.

On my biceps, jewels.

Those, by the way, flex those bad boys.

For me, if you're trying to.

Oh, welcome to the gun show.

Look at that.

I've got fun at Gabe's.

How many times have you flexed in your life?

Three?

And what were the occasions?

Both were, but I think two times were jokes.

One time was just to check it out.

What would it look like?

Yeah.

I just wanted to see it in the light.

Jim Orson.

R.I.P. Bafftub.

It's really free.

R.I.B.

What is R.I.B.?

All right, Bafftub.

All right.

Rest in Bafftub.

Paul.

Yes.

We got to get to the best episodes of the year.

We got to get to them.

This is exciting.

We're gonna count down your top 14 episodes that.

Your top 14.

That's right.

It's not my top.

I would rank them quite different.

Oh my god.

I read me.

Scott, I wish one year we would reveal our rankings.

That would be fun.

It would blow people's mind.

And I would just say like, okay, for me, what would it be like the ones that we enjoyed the most, like critically with our critical faculties, we think are the best, or is it the ones we enjoy doing the most?

It's the one I'm in.

Scott.

You would just list all of yours?

Of course.

What other list is there?

The list is life.

Another great holiday movie.

I love it.

She lives at the end.

There's red.

Well, in the middle.

Is it red in the middle?

I believe she walks around in the middle of the movie.

Oh really?

Yeah, yeah.

For some reason, my memory is just at the end.

I believe it's the halfway point of the movie.

She's just like running around there, glamin' it up in red.

Oh, she.

In the middle.

She is a real diva.

I haven't seen it in 20 odd years.

Who is she?

She grew up to be gold in my ear.

Really?

Incredible.

Who was she?

I think she's just a little girl.

Just a little girl.

Oh, little girl.

Blistful and aware of the horror around her.

Well, as are we during this holiday season, because we are here to entertain you, and we're here to count down your top 14 episodes.

These are episodes that you voted on every year, right after Thanksgiving.

We put up.

The American holiday.

We put up the voting for the best of.

So it goes from Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving.

Mm-hmm.

We're not.

Fair.

Technically 2018.

It's late 2017 to late 2018.

But this is released in 2018.

You get the idea.

I need time to tabulate the votes.

I need time to make the edits, which is a three or four day process for me.

Time to make the edits.

That's a Christmas tradition for me.

Yeah.

Out there on Christmas Eve, just making the edits, listening to 14 episodes of my show.

Now, one time you fell asleep, and some elves made the edits.

They did.

I woke up and I was like, these edits are not good.

No.

They're made by tiny hands.

They're made tiny, tiny hands with tiny scissors.

What's going on with your levels there?

You try to- Well, I was turning up the wrong box.

I wanted to hear myself a little bit.

You want to hear yourself more?

Now, do these- I'm doing a new studio for an interview.

Can we turn up each other or down each other, or it's just purely just the- Can we do up voting and down voting?

Can we do up voting and down voting?

That is my question.

Sam, please don't get on my- One of my favorite things on Reddit is that the categories of comments.

One of the- You can view them- Oh, I did an AMA on this.

Old, new, an ANA?

AMA.

Oh.

Ask me anything.

Yeah, that's what it stands for, right?

I did an American Medical Association.

So this is a website that you- This is a website that you can go on.

Okay.

And so in a comment, in a thread, you'll see the comments and you can view them by different categories.

You can view them by old, by new, and my favorite is best.

Best.

Who's deciding what the best comments are?

What if there was someone on the internet who was just like wandering around and judging every comment on everything and just- The Wandering Jew.

He wanders the earth judging comments.

What is the story of the Wandering- I don't even want to say it.

I don't know, like he- It's a holiday thing though, right?

Yeah.

Isn't it?

I don't think it's a holiday thing.

Oh, okay.

I think it's just like a legend and it's like he denied our lord.

Oh, okay, and he's forced to wander the earth like- I wander around and then they- Throughout time immemorial?

Yeah, and then they named a plant after him.

They did which plant?

The Wandering Jew.

That's a plant?

Yeah.

There's a plant called- People call a plant yet?

Yeah, yeah.

That seems like it should be changed in 2018, at least 2019.

What's the plant look like?

I don't know.

I'm gonna look it up.

Okay, yeah.

Why don't you tell- Tell people more things.

Okay.

We are going to be going through the episodes from 14 down to one.

So we're not going to start at one and not going to start with the best.

We're going to start with the worst of the 14.

I believe we put out about 60 episodes this year and we got over 35,000 votes, 35,000 votes.

I looked up the Wandering Jew, the guy, and it's quite something.

Really?

What do you have to tell us about that?

Do you want to continue with this and then we'll come back to it?

Well, let's come back to it.

Yeah, we have over 35,000 votes and we put out about 60 episodes.

We're going to play you approximately a quarter of them.

The top 14- You're a little chuckling to yourself about this guy.

The idea of it is ridiculous.

All right, just hit us with this.

All right.

What do we got?

The Wandering Jew is a mythical immortal man whose legend began to spread in Europe in the 13th century.

The original legend concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the crucifixion.

On the way?

And was then cursed to walk the earth until the second coming.

Cursed by whom?

That sounds mean.

I mean presumably Jesus.

That sounds like a mean thing to do.

Jesus did one time get mad at a fig tree for not having figs.

Okay.

And he made it die.

Okay, but it's not a sentient, unless it's some sort of grute situation.

It was not grute.

It was not grutes.

Yeah.

Okay, but you'll know grute.

By the trail of death.

But this, okay, let's listen to this guy.

So Jesus is dragging his cross to be crucified on it.

That's by the way, that's fucking brutal.

Yeah.

Like we're going to, here's we're going to do.

We're going to fight you.

But you get it.

All the way over there.

And you got to hoof it.

You got to drag this thing up there.

It's part of the indignity of this fiction.

Yeah.

But I guess what I mean to ask is, if this is a story concocted by Christians and followers of Christ, it's not a good look, Jesus.

No, but doesn't say that Jesus did it.

It could be that just like cursing.

As a result.

It was as the power of curses.

As a result.

Is that gypsy and thinner?

Of course, of course.

Fina.

Wanda.

So it's Jesus' dad?

God?

I guess so.

This is, okay, but that's what I mean to say is, is if you're on the side of Jesus.

Which I am.

Okay, just.

I want that out there.

I'm on the side of Jesus.

It's not a good look on Jesus.

No, it's not.

And if you're on the other side, it must be a Jewish myth.

Like these Christians they cursed are people.

It's an interesting take.

That's an interesting take.

Here's how bad.

Here's how bad these Christians are.

They cursed one of us.

They cursed one of us to wander forever.

With their magic powers.

Until Jesus comes back from, you know.

Also, if you are Jewish and you think that Jesus has the power to curse people.

There we go.

Then he must be the son of God.

Then why are you Jewish?

Exactly.

Why are you Jewish?

But I love the idea of like.

So you're, so Jesus is carrying the cross, right?

Mm-hmm.

And then there's like this guy on the side and I was going, Ha ha, Jesus.

Look at you.

You can barely carry that thing.

You look stupid.

And then this guy's cursed.

Just cursed.

Just to wander around.

And he can't even buy a home?

I don't know.

I guess it's that after a while, people begin to talk like, hey, how come you haven't aged?

I guess if, okay, so there's been.

Are you the wandering Jew?

There's been a little over 2,000 years since Jesus died.

Mm-hmm.

Since 33 AD.

Yeah.

Seems like yesterday.

And we're not going to get into that argument again.

No.

About whether it's 33 or 33.

No, I think it's great.

And then approximately what?

A thousand years before that when the earth was created?

Yeah.

So, but in 2000 years, do you think you could get to every place?

He's probably on foot.

In 2000 years, yes.

So in 2000 years, you could just, you could cover the entire globe.

How are you going to get to- Especially when air travel comes along.

How are you going to get to those islands?

Well, not on purpose.

You're going to become an astronaut?

Not on purpose.

I mean, you end up on those islands.

What if Larry Hagman was the wandering Jew?

Oh my God.

That's why he got the living from his family.

There are many species of plants named wandering Jew by the way.

Okay.

Do you, oh, there are?

Yes.

Well, like it's so, it's such a popular name.

There's three that are known as a wandering Jew.

There's, there's, uh, and then there's four, there's three plants and four dayflowers, which I've never heard of.

What are dayflowers?

Like vampire flowers that can survive during the day.

What a botanist out there screaming at their podcast machines.

And then at the end, other plants known as wandering Jew include two more.

Wow.

People really wanted to name plants wandering Jew.

Why?

This is bizarre.

I don't know.

Just call it some- How many plants are named Rumpelstiltskin?

None.

And yet, we'll name a plant after this slur.

dumber will name eight plans after it. I don't know. All right, we need to get to our first clip of the day. If you say this is number 14. Number one for. All right, clip number 14. This is from Episode 558, by the way, today on today's episode, we are going to be 14 13 12 and 11. 14 13 12 and 11. 14 13 12 and 11. 14 13 12 and 11. Then the rest of them.

This is Episode 558. Which episode do you think this is? Do you memorize all the numbers?

Of course I did. Of course I did. This is what was the most recent episode that just aired?

The one that just aired was, I can look that up. It would have been 579. Yeah, so that would put this one squarely in earlier. Yes. And I guess earlier that the recent one that is not eligible. This is the one with Ricky Martin and Pol Pot. You wouldn't think those two would have a lot in common. They really hit it off.

This is an episode called Ship of Love. Ship. Shove. Shove. Yeah, for sure. Shove. Yes.

This is the episode where everyone just shoved each other the entire time. It was made for bad audio, but great podcasting.

Now this is an episode called Ship of Love with Casey Wilson, Drew Tarver and Zach Oyama.

Okay. Okay. Don't remember it. Not crying in any bells. I think I do. And I think that Drew Tarver plays a guy who sings a bunch of songs. Drew Tarver. Yes. Plays a guy who bunch who who a bunch of sings a bunch of things. A bunch of things. A bunch of things.

By the way, we just got Kettle Glaze Donuts delivered to us.

And some cookies. And some cookies by Colin. Thank you so much. Cookies by Colin. He made these. He made these? They're wrapped in plastic just like Laura Palmer. We'll dig into those while we listen to the clip. This is an episode called Ship of Love. Now let me give you a little backstory about this. I had Casey Wilson, a good dear friend of mine on the show. Good and dear? Good dear friend of mine. Damn. Where we talked a little bit before the clip that you'll hear.

We talked a little bit about her Oscar parties and how obnoxious I am during them. And then Drew Tarver, our good friend, he came in as a character called Martin Sheffield Lickley.

That's right. Martin Sheffield Lickley. So.

Now if you're listening to the clip, you also can eat cookies. That's true. While you listen to this. That's very true. So that'll be enjoyable for only cookies. Only cookies. No savory. Don't take any medications. Nope. No pot roasts. No.

You can't eat a fucking Yorkshire pudding. Let's listen to the clip. This is your number 14.

All right. This is exciting. He's an entertainer and he's about to come out here. He's an 80s new wave singer. Please welcome Martin Sheffield Lickley.

Hello. How are you guys?

How are we doing? They say love is but a game. And it's only played by fools. But like in a game, they're all winners and losers. But who makes up the rules? Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Good evening. My darling. Lovely. Good at well afternoon. Good afternoon.

I guess England. England maybe it's evening. Yes. I always stay on my local time. It's the afternoon. Welcome to the show. Martin Sheffield Lickley.

Martin Sheffield Lickley.

I'm the lead singer of the 80s new wave band two plus two equals love. Oh. Okay. A lot of guests don't have entrance music. But yes. No. Thank you.

Thank you so much. I started singing a song and then you stopped very abruptly. I stopped very quickly. That was the end of that song. But yeah. From the southern England. Yeah.

Down south. There's a little bit of a draw. But definitely England. I am from Wilkinshire, Dirtshire, flat ground chire. Okay. I've been to that area of England. It sounds beautiful. It's gorgeous. It's seven in my town, seven people and four thousand sheep. Oh.

What a ratio. Yes. Yes. Wow. That's like a ratio on Twitter of likes to retweet. It's exactly like that, Scott. Yes. This is Casey Wilson, by the way. Hello, Casey. How we doing tonight? Such a pleasure to meet you.

Very nice to meet you. Casey's a singer as well. Have you ever heard of the band two plus two equals love? It's so funny. I hadn't. You hadn't.

Neither have I. I don't remember them. And I'm an aficionado of 80s music. Yeah. No, we, you know, we didn't quite take off like, you know, flock of sea gulls or do I enjoy that? Yeah, you like that. Try to work do another pun for each band. You're going to run quite as fast as do ran, do ran. Good.

You know, really good. All right. What else you got in the tank? And I didn't grow quite as short as Little Boy George. That one fell off. Yeah.

Especially since his name was little boy George. It wasn't. Well, he's just boy George George. Yeah. The sheep motif is getting, do you? Well, yeah. I mean, I think, you know, my two plus two equals love, you know, I've always been a fan of love. Hmm. I guess we all are. Yeah. But when I was younger, you know, my little black book will let's just say it wasn't quite so little. But I mean, was it just black book like boy George? Yeah. Yeah. It was a boy, a black book and Little Boy George. How old are you? It seems hard to. Thank you so much. Well, you could be four years old. You could be a hundred. Well, thank you so much.

Yeah. You know, I, I don't like to say my age, you know, but I look young. I tell, I, I look, you know, I have the look of a cold tan bird. Yeah. Is that what it is? A bird that's just freezing. But tan. Yeah.

It has been to the beach, but is now cold. Maybe it has come back up north for the summer, but it's an early chill has exactly, exactly. You know, my life has been very fantastic, you know, until I have nast, but that's very interesting.

Thank you. Yeah. How's your life been fantastic. It's been, you know, I've been singing, but everything turned on its head last year when my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes, it was it. Oh, how's she doing? You see, it was a terrifying experience. But ultimately it brought a brought us closer together. And that's when I wrote this next song about it.

What hit it? Oh.

All aboard the ship of love. We're going full speed ahead.

The ocean is full of broken hearts and the captain is a kiss. Ship of love full of tender hugs. I must steer the course right to the island of love. There are pineapples and cracks there, but I cannot eat them because I am too hot broken to the feet. It's the ship. It's the ship. The ship of love. I drive the ship. Drive the ship. The ship of love.

Look out for rocks. Big, scary rocks. The rocks are metaphors for my broken heart.

Thank you. Wow. Thank you.

That's amazing. Thank you. My wife didn't make it. And I sang that at her funeral. Whoa.

How was it? How was it received? Um, tepidly. Yeah, I can imagine. People are expecting to live up beat for a funeral. They love beat. But you know, I take inspiration and out comes that new wave sound. Yeah, the sound I've noticed that ABC used for their song, Look of Love. Oh, and it's the exact same backing track as the first song. Really? I don't hear that at all. Okay, there's maybe some subtle differences.

Yeah, there's some subtle differences.

I mean, you know, we were all, you know, taking from each other in that time period, you know, how so? You know, just learning from one another. Little boy George would be sitting on my sessions in Duran Duran when, you know, run from my sessions. But yeah, you know, it's my life has been filled with tragedy again. I did not ask. Thank you for asking. I'm so sorry about your wife. What else terrible? How long? Yeah, how long were you together? Oh, we were together for 30 years.

I'm so sorry. Really devastating, you know, and um, that's terrible. Have you bounced back? This was last year? Well, yeah, I mean, uh, I was, I was feeling a little better until my I lost my son. No. Yes. You lost your son as well. Oh my gosh.

What happened there? This is terrible. This next one's for you, Simon. Oh, what?

You've been arrested by the love police for the crime of breaking my heart.

I'm locking you up for 20 years in love. Jail. Love jail is a place where lovers go when their hearts commit a crime. And they're the prisoners are all locked away behind love.

Bars. They left me away and threw away the key and my cellmate was my broken heart.

There must be a way to get out of here because in love jail we do hard time. Breaking hearts is the ultimate crime. There must be a way out of here because pretty soon they'll put me in the electric chair of love. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you.

Wow. Quite a tribute. Thank you. That song is about my dead son. Yeah, you never even mentioned him as far as I can really really tell. Maybe a bleakly.

Well, yeah, you know, songwriting is all about imagery and, you know, non being too literal. Yeah, I gotta say it's not literal. It's not really a tears in heaven. A tear jerker style. Well, you know, my son, you know, he died of emphysema. So he didn't fall out of windows. So it's a different situation.

Different. You know, I would love to write tears in heaven, but my son died differently.

Did you sing that at his funeral? I did. And it was it was not received well. No.

I can imagine. Well, on the heels of your wife's right on the heels. And when you say that, how do you mean? Well, is it a double my sir? Yes, it was a double funeral. It saved us a little bit of money.

Okay, well, I mean, I guess I chilled my wife for about a month.

You put her on ice. Oh, wait. So it wasn't like a couple days within a couple of days.

It was like a Carrie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds. It was no, no, no, no, a month apart. A month apart.

And I said, how did you know your son was dying of emphysema a month later?

Great question. Was he suffering, Brad? He was suffering.

You just thought it might go that way.

Yeah, I was headed. The doctors were like, it's not looking good. And, you know, it was it was just tough. Yeah, I can imagine. So I wouldn't have had and combined the funerals. Yeah. Well, how much did you save? 30 dollars. Oh, 14 quid. Thank you.

Thank you. Of course, of course.

Well, that's, I mean, it's a lot of tragedy. It's tough. I mean, I wear this suit to commemorate my son. As you can see, there's sort of a cool paint splatter on it, but that's actually blood from my son's coughs. Oh, that's terrible. And I'm so that's a lot, by the way, that's a hefty amount. Yes, it's a lot. He had emphysema, which is typically a disease that people have after smoking for years. I was going to say, but I got, you know, I'm sure that anyone can get emphysema.

Yeah, or did your son die of smoking? He was smoking. I told him not to. You know, he saw that kid who smokes on YouTube, the little baby boy. Have you seen it? Yes. You've seen it. He's puffs on those sigis. I haven't seen it. My son saw it and he couldn't stop himself. I said, don't watch that video. That kid's going to be sick. So you saw it down the road. I saw it.

I saw it all, you know? Wow. But yeah, I just, you know, I've got a big summer tour plan. You do.

Also, so does Casey with bits. Oh, fantastic. I'd love to come to yours. Maybe playing the same venues. Oh, yeah. Well, I'm doing a 16 cemetery tour.

Cemetery? Yes. I go to cemeteries and I sing songs to the people I've lost. You've lost people in 16 cemeteries.

Well, I know at least one person in every cemetery in America and the United Kingdom. That's a lot of cemetery science. My life has been plagued with tragedies. I mean, we've only been talking about the people close to you just one year ago. No, I lost my postman this morning. Wow.

Yes. I walked outside and I saw him.

And then I was later, I found out that I'd lost him. I'd known him for 16 years. Really? How did you find out? Sorry. Oh, I saw it all the news. Postman mails himself to the bottom of the ocean.

What? What? Terrible way to go. Oh my gosh. It was an accident. It was a horrible accident.

Was it like an envelope accident? Yes. It makes up. Just a mix up. Yeah. In the post office.

Just he got wrapped up and took a nap, got boxed up, bought over the ocean. Terrible. I know.

Terrible. Just a few hours. It's just a few hours. That's a pretty swift time to get that on the air, by the way. It's just so much for you to go through.

It's so much, you know. It's tough. My life has been plagued with tragedy, but I met someone recently who turned everything around. Oh, well, you're turning swords into plowshares. That's wonderful. Wonderful of you. A new love can be truly the cure to what ails you.

Absolutely. And his name is Jesus Christ. Oh, okay. I met him and he came into my heart and saved me.

And I've never felt better. So I've decided to dedicate all of my music to my Lord and Savior.

Jesus Christ. Don't tell me you have a song. Yes. This next song is called Jesus is my one true Savior. Oh, no.

Where I bet my heart on black. I've hit the jackpot of breaking hearts and I'm a high roller when it comes to kissing. We play love poker and the dealer is my broken heart that ships we play with.

Our memories of love. You have to count cards in order to win the game because just like love, love poker isn't fair at all. It's the casino. It's the casino. The love casino. Row the dice.

It feels nice. The love casino. Play the slots. Their love slots at the love casino.

My son's dad. Thank you. Okay. All right. Number one, four.

The pudding. The pudding.

No, the cookies. That was, of course, Ship of Love. Drew Tarver as Martin Sheffield Lickley from two plus two equals love. What's the jack playing then again?

Zach, a little later after this clip a little later in the episode, Zach Oyama, who was on twice this year, he did his first two episodes.

He's great. He's really funny.

He did. He comes up a little later and plays credit card points expert Chase.

This is really funny. Let me say without food, my mouth, Zach is very funny.

Yes. Just so an unequivocal non-food and now compliment from Paul F.

Come before me for bring me more cookies.

I should also say those songs were co-written with Brad Evans and Nick Sierrale.

That Drew works with quite often. I believe he may have written the songs that he did about the McDonald's cups and everything that he did on our Atlanta.

Donnie Gary. Donnie Gary. I believe he co-wrote the songs with those two guys as well.

Big shout out to them. That was a funny clip, right? That's a good way to start.

I think so. Yeah. I mean, I'm not defensive or anything.

You seem defensive about this. No, I love that. That was a really fun episode to do.

Three great people go and check out the entire episode if you like. All right. We have to get to a break. When we come back, we are going to be playing your number 13 episode.

Do you get the pattern, idiots? We sung about it before. Oh, 14, 13, 12, 11, 14, 13, 12, 11. Can I say that I hate the audience? I think they're dumb.

No. They don't get things. No. What? That Christmas you tell the truth.

Who said that at Christmas you tell the truth like it was a thing?

Yeah, that crazy person, the crazy man with the signs.

What was that? Actually in love act. Oh, right. The guy that was in love with his best friend's wife and he just says it in the movie like at Christmas you tell the truth. Like this is a thing we've all agreed on. Yes. Stupid. Now, I can't remember if it was a reference to something that was said earlier in that movie, but I also don't care. I do not care to watch it again in order to find out. I'm happy to be wrong about it and still feel the way that I feel.

All right. Well, one thing that we are not wrong about is the order in which we are going to be doing these clips. When we come back after this, we will have number 13 with comedy bang bang, best of 2018. Comedy bang bang, best of 2018. Comedy back, but I mean that all went in, right?

No, I think we had a big mistake big long conversation about the dukes of hazard and smoking the bandit off mic, which unfortunately did not go in, but check out our page. Check out our Patreon for that 90 second conversation. Welcome back.

We are counting down the 14 13 12 11 14 13 12 11 14 13 12 11. And we have come up to number 13 on the countdown. Here it is.

You've been waiting for it. Number one three. All right.

Number 13. Let's see. The last one we listened to was five hundred and fifty eight, which I believe was in the middle of the year around July or so. Yeah, this is five hundred and thirty two. So this is even earlier than that. Even earlier than that. I'm going to say it's probably a June. I didn't do 20 episodes in one month. Hey, I'm sorry. I don't mean to come down on you like that. No, I don't know numbers.

You know, I do. How do you know 14 13 12 11? I just I'm just frenetically repeating.

I can't stay mad at you. You're too cute. My doorable.

This is episode five hundred and five hundred and thirty two. Sure. This is an episode called Everything is Horrible and Wonderful. Guess who's in this episode? No need to tell me it's Rod Stewart and the Willys. Who are the Willys? I don't know.

No, of course, Paul of Tom kisses in this episode. Well, that's me. It's you. This is from February, if I'm not mistaken. And this is an episode with our good friend, Stephanie Whittles Wax.

That's right. Her name is a sentence. Her name and we get to that in the episode. I'm not sure if we get to it in this clip. Oh, who knows. But Stephanie Whittles Wax is of course our dear friend, Harris's sister. She wrote a book called Everything is Horrible and Wonderful. And she came on the show to talk about it. RIP Harris Wax. This is Whittles actually was his name was Harris Whittles. Oh, don't tell me that. Is that for real?

Have you been calling him Harris Wax?

I called him Harris Wax for years. Oh, no. I said it's full name every time. Hi, Harris Wax.

Harris Wax. Harris Wax. Harris Wax. This episode also has Will Hines and Tawny Newsom in it.

And we are going to hear a clip. The things you need to know about the clip is Please let me be in the clip. You are in the clip, as a matter of fact. At this point in the episode, please let me be the focus of the clip. You are the focus of this. Oh, thank God. That is not please don't do this for every episode you're in because you are not for everyone.

I find out previous to this clip. We've talked to Stephanie about her book for a long time.

And as I recall, it was just me and her and I kept the rest of you waiting for an hour.

Well, we did that. Yeah, yeah. I had a sock on the door. So we couldn't go in there.

It was not mean what I thought it meant. You guys assumed I was fucking her. Yeah.

And yes, I talked. I believe something we started very late or whatever. And then the conversation got heavy in a way at certain points. And so argued about politics.

She's a big Trump girl. She loves Trump.

Sweet leaf. But so I kept you guys waiting for an hour, but you were very nice about that.

And so at this point in the episode, Morpheus, the dream Lord who will Heinz plays, Wil Heinz another great addition, recent addition to the comedy bang bang. Another tradition and just a great crew of people. He I'm sorry, I'm being distracted by something happening in the other room and I apologize for that. So sorry if I can't keep my train of thought, but our good friend Corinna is here to drop off something for me is our good friend.

And thank you very much. Do you want to get on Mike? Her. I'll give you a Christmas present.

Her. Her. Say hi. Her podcast is called We Love Lucy. So yes, go go listen to that. I had no idea.

I'm getting the word out. Here you go. So say hi. I can't wait for you to cut this later.

No, I will not. Thank you, Corinna. Have a great holiday.

Merry Christmas. And happy wandering, Jew year.

Is it is it the right decision to be mentioning this term over and over in our best of episode?

I mean, I mean, it isn't a this is the place for it. Oh dear. All right. So at this point, Wil Heinz he plays Morpheus, the dream Lord, and he has put us ostensibly he has put Stephanie and I to sleep during the episode. Sounds like he's the focus of it.

And so we are in the dream realm. He has transported us to the dream realm during this clip.

And Paul F you play a person named Brock Lovett. And completely forgotten. Yeah, as did I until I listened to it, but this is one of my favorite appearances by you this year. Let's listen to this clip. This is your number 13. Number one three. All right.

Well, let's welcome him to the show.

He's a treasure hunter. This is very exciting. Perhaps we'll he'll lead us to some. Oh, that's not pressure I should put on you. Well, I certainly have a story to tell you. Oh, very good. He is a treasure hunter. Please welcome Brock Lovett. Thank you very much. Scott. Thanks for having me on the show. Welcome to the show. This is Morpheus, the dream Lord. Hi Morpheus. Can I get you an minion? Yes. Can I get you something to die? Coke, a nostalgic breeze. There's one thing I want more than anything else, but I don't know if you could help me out and it would maybe spoil my whole face. Yeah. Well, I'll just take a I'll take a pop LaCroy. Let me see. I know I have coconut though. Let me see what I got. Oh, coconut. I think grapefruit if that helps. That's what pop LaMoses. Oh, okay. Thank you. Yeah, by the way, I can't eat grapefruit. And they and I was out to dinner with some acquaintances recently. Like, good acquaintances. Like, you're hiding in neat. What's happening? Are you hiding a name drop? Is what's going on? Are you trying to?

No, I may be doing a subtle, subtle neck. But they they serve they want to serve me a drink and they called it pomple moose. And I forgot that my friends wanted to serve you this drink. No, somebody even worse, a waiter. So the waiter just said, I want to serve you this drink. You had to like you didn't ask for it? No, it was a it was a surprise.

They say on the menu, surprise me.

I said, yeah, surprise me. Like I'll order whatever they want to make. Right. And then they said, okay, well, we want to bring you a pomple moose, whatever. Right. So you grapefruit. So they told you what it was going to be. That was the surprise.

Okay, look, Brock. What? You seem to be almost defensive. This was a story that this is a story that you initiated. I just wanted to make sure I'm following a character. I thought that people would find it of interest. But I guess not. Did you finish the story or no? I drank the drink. Why can't you have grapefruit?

Are you doing vocal warmups right now? I drink the drink of pomple moose. The drink you drank?

Look, let's forget it. This is Stephanie Whittleswack. Hi, Stephanie. How are you? I'm a treasure hunter.

I heard. That's fabulous. What sort of treasure do you hunt, my goodness?

Sunken treasure. That's my experience. Primarily sunken treasure. So if the treasure is on the land, it's not of interest to you. Well, I mean, if it's just sitting there, I'll take it.

What if it's floating waist high? Sure. How sunken does it have to be? What if it's under half a foot of water? What if a bathroom floods over some jewels? Here's the reason. Look, these are all good scenarios. The reason I say I primarily deal in sunken treasure is that's the treasure no one's gotten to yet. Oh, usually bathroom treasure. If it's just if you could still see it through the water, somebody would get there before me. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

So this is strange. It belongs to somebody, like probably the person that lives there and then you would be stealing and that's not right.

Maybe. I mean, it would be strange if I was in someone's home, their bathroom flooded.

I was like, I'm going to take the balloons.

So you've searched for water in the seas in the. I have not searched for water.

Usually. Sorry. That is not Columbus. Yes. Oh, I know of Christopher Columbus, the man who discovered water. What I'm getting through is to discover air. From dreams, it's so hard to tell.

He discovered water and then he enslaved it. That's right.

That's okay. He enslaved the water.

I meant to say like psyched about it. It's hard to put together. I meant to say treasure, of course.

You searched for treasure underwater. That's right. I do.

What are some of the tre- have you found much treasure? I found I'm very famous for finding Spanish gold.

Wow. That's right. You say you're very famous. So in treasure hunting circles.

Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Because I've never, I don't think I've ever heard of you. Have I?

Well, let me ask you this. Have you heard of the Titanic?

Wow. I can see the italics and your phrasing. Do you mean the motor, the movie?

What movie? There's a movie of the Titanic about the phone.

Oh, a night to remember. That's right.

Yeah. No, no, not the film. No, no, no. Everyone should see it. No, not that. It's one of the things that made me a treasure hunter. No, there's a more recent film, although recent by 20 years ago.

Another night to remember? Night to remember too. The second one. Night in museum. One more night.

No, the movie Titanic starring Kate Winslet, who puts the titular tit in Titanic.

Titanic. Now, yes, when I've heard people dream of this, they don't say it to Tannock the way you just they really you really shortened that first. Is that the proper pronunciation?

People dreaming of movies they saw? Mostly, yes. Well, that's the part I'm a bit.

Am I doing that? I'm a bit of a film buff. I don't know. I don't know what you want to do.

I put the buff in film buff in Titanic, I have to say. All right. I think I know what you're saying.

She's negative. Does she play? Does she play Rose DeWitt?

She does play Rose DeWitt. Yes.

Am I in this movie? Wait, who? Let me name her character named Brock, love it in this movie.

Well, it's Leo DiCaprio played Brock. Yeah. Who plays the kid from growing pains?

Do you like growing pains? I love growing pains. What about that Alan Thicke?

He was terrific. He's a great guy. Too soon. Too soon. He died? He did. He did. You don't know when people die? People are still dreaming about him. I thought he was still around. I was like, yes, he is. Dreams aren't happening. Right? Oh, I didn't think to check him.

Morpheus, can I ask you a question? Of course. Anything.

How many people would you say are dreaming of Alan Thicke on a regular basis? That's an information.

Let me look it up right now. 17 people.

Oh, more than I thought. Yeah. Like at this very moment. At this moment, there are 17 Alan Thicke dreams going on. How many people are dreaming of the Robin Thicke blurred lines video?

Let me look at that. Oh, 150. That's a flummer for Alan.

Three models put the tit into that video.

Which video is the least dreamed about? These passive questions are hard to prove the absence of something. Is it I can dream about you? No, that's pretty good. It's doing pretty good. From Streets of Fire. Right. What a great movie that everybody knows. Streets of Fire.

Oh, Billy, don't you lose my number by Phil Collins? Oh, yeah. At the least people in the film. Oh, Phil Collins. Yeah, that tracks. Okay, so now let me think. There's a there's a Bill Paxton plays a character in this film where oh, I guess he's a treasure hunter. The guy from Weird Science? Yeah. You saw aliens as well. I saw alien and I saw alien cubed.

Right. This was the one in between. It was aliens to the second power.

Pass. Okay, he's in it. You might like it. But he plays a character who goes looking for, I believe it's called the heart of the ocean. The heart of the the court of the mare. This this is my story. Really? So this movie's about me. I guess, yeah. Well, I mean, I don't know the movies really about the Bill Paxton character. I mean, every move we all star in our own movies. Right. Yeah. So yes. That's really wise. I feel like you're trying to let me down. Easy, Stephanie. No way. I would never do that.

It starts with Bill Paxton.

Sounds good. Go on. Looking around for this precious jewel.

Looking around for it like you walked into a room. Yeah. He kind of scans everyone's seen that heart of the ocean. I mean, you never know where you're going to find it. I only know what people dream about this movie and no one has dreamed about this part of the movie. Yeah, mostly people are dreaming about that. No one dreams about Bill Paxton. Look through couch cushions for a press. That's not what I've witnessed. There's a lot of people on the bowels of ships and people drawing naked people and love and sacrifice. They don't know. It's not a guy like looking around.

Well, it was the naked portrait. That's how I found Rose to wit because I dove on the Titanic and it's immersible. And I found this safe where I thought I was going to find the heart of the ocean. But I did find this naked sketch of a naked lady that had to call up Rose to wit and say, hey, look, I found this naked picture. Well, is that you?

How about conversation go? Was that awkward? Yeah, really. It was awkward. Did you lead right in with that? Or did you try to warm up there was like a little small talk at first? Shit, chat.

Just a yeah. I was like, what do you think about sunken gold? Pretty interesting. Right? I found some. So really, what do you think about your profession? Well, yeah, but what is thinking a lot of questions about her? Well, I kind of knew some stuff about her. And was it her? It was her. And so I interviewed her at length. Did you get it right on the first call? First call. Were there phones?

Were there phones? Yeah, in my name, maybe not then, but there are now 1997. Oh, okay. Okay.

Okay. So yeah, there was. Okay. I couldn't remember where they as small as they are now or I've noticed that phones, they got smaller for a while now they're getting bigger. We talk landline to landline.

Wow. That must be hard for you, a person who primarily likes to go diving deep dives. Do you feel out of sorts, Brock levered when you are not beneath the ocean? I do. I love being here's the thing. I love being under the ocean looking for treasure. And I love finding treasure under the ocean. Right? Those are my two loves.

Two sides at the same coin. Okay. Coins that gets me going hypothetical. Two, I can give you two vacations. Okay. You're underwater the whole time, but there's no treasure.

Or lots of treasure, but it is dry as a bone. Just bone dry.

I guess I got to go with treasure.

I like treasure more than anything. Is that what gets you into the ocean?

The promise of treasure? I think I've established that.

That's why, because other people haven't gotten that treasure yet. So that's where I go there. But if if suddenly it were to come out front page news extra extra, there's no more treasure in the ocean.

Would you say, well, I'm never going in the ocean again?

Yeah, that's right.

Look, if you told me that treasure was found exclusively at the top of stairs, I'd go out and buy a Fitbit and make my steps every day.

You ever get the bends?

I have gotten the bends. Yeah, it's tough. That's rough stuff. That's got to hurt. What are these bends? What are these Benji speaker? Well, if you come up too quickly, the bubbles in your blood tend to expand. Is that something like that? That's the same if you come out of a nightmare. Nightmares are all in the pool. It feels a lot like that.

The water is on the ground here, these lakes and these.

Creek, those are all made of night. Is there any treasure in there? No, Brock, stay away from those. Those are nightmare creaks.

You don't want to go in there.

What's in them? There's treasure and there's... What?

He's driving you crazy. It's all I want to do is go out. I'm not going to lie.

Nightmare Creek. Don't be a treasure tease. I'm not going to lie. There's some doubloons.

I mean, there's nothing great. There's some doubloons.

There's, I don't know, a couple arcs.

Don't worry about it. Let me ask you this. Do they stay doubloons the whole time or like, you bring them out of the nightmare creek, they turn into something else?

They turn into something else. And it's all a lesson.

Good to know. Yeah. I don't need that.

Yeah. Well, I will say at the end of the movie Titanic, what happens? Hold on a second.

You don't have to tell me because here's what happened in real life. Okay.

So I may rose to it. I'm trying to find this heart of the ocean necklace.

Here's a long story. All I care about is the treasure, right?

Right. But she tells you a long story about her life. Yeah.

Well, I'm sorry, Stephanie. You don't care about water. You don't care about rose. Just treasure.

He's resetting. I get it. That's how I am at the beginning.

I understand.

And then by the end of her story, she tells you a story about a man with a toupee that is in love with her. That's right. She tried to claim you had alopecia, but I was like, his eyebrows are fine.

So I don't buy your story. I think he's just regular old bald.

I know someone with alopecia, by the way.

John T. Alopecia. What a brag. What a brag.

It's tough. I wish I could meet somebody with alopecia.

Does he really have alopecia?

Or did he fake alopecia to get out of a long term relationship?

I've never been able to determine it. You've never been able? Well, I mean, I feel like you know one thing about this guy. I ask. Well, I do know that his wife's name is Karl Lefur. All right. We're getting off track. Okay. I can tell who has real alopecia because in the people who are faking alopecia in their dreams, they have hair, but the real alopecia people in their dreams, nobody has. It makes sense. Yeah.

It's like you can't die in your dream.

You can't go bald. You can't have alopecia in your dreams unless you have alopecia.

Yeah. If you do, then you're going to wake up with real alopecia.

So she tells you this story. And by the end of the story, I realized that the Titanic was more than just a treasure hunt. You know, this is about people's lives and I had a new respect for it.

And I was sad that I wasn't going to get the heart of the ocean that it was lost forever.

And I even through my, I was keeping a cigar that I was going to smoke after I found it, I threw it overboard. Wow. What a symbol of a moment.

Exactly. So what a sacrifice.

Rose and I stayed in contact and we became friends. And you know, she died a couple months ago and I went to her funeral. And her granddaughter, Lizzie, confided in me that Rose had the heart of the ocean the whole time. Well, never told me and threw it over the side of the boat.

Yeah, she does that movie. She does it like literally right after she talks to you. Like she was wearing it the entire time. If you would just like maybe opened up her, the cleavage of her shirt or something, you're not going to do that. What a weird thing. Well, you're diving around in the ocean. Why not dive around in there? There's several reasons. I feel you really need this explained. I don't know. Wow. I may not know boundaries.

Scott sounds like a guy. I should bring him over to the wet dream section of the dream. Yeah, I'm a greedy monster with gold fever, but what you said is really not cool. So anyway, there are good guys left in the world.

Right. I want to hear one of them. There we go. The one you probably won't be going to see too many movies if you did rock over here because he's missing. I've seen a few movies. I've missed some others. What's the big deal? What's your favorite movie of all time? Let's see favorite movie of all time. I got to go with used cars. Used cars. Sorry, Kurt Russell. Robert Zemeckis film. Sure.

No one is dreamed of that movie. I don't know. No one ever.

Not even me. Let me check. No, you haven't either. That's too bad. It's not in your library at all. No, there's no record of anybody having dreamed of this film. I got 10 men. Is it like 10 men? Not really. I've never seen that one. So I have a lot of people have dreamed of 10 men.

Well, the fine young cannibals are in it.

Let me see. All of them. Yeah. All three of them. There's three people.

Oh, the people have only dreamed of two of the fine young men. That's where because I usually never miss their movies. So here's my question. Now, when you found out that information a couple of months ago that the heart of the ocean is right where you were, why not dive back down in there and try scooping it up or something? Okay, well, did you hear the part where this is years later? Wow. 20 years. But I mean, you found the Titanic. So why can't you find the heart of the ocean? Yeah, it might still be there.

Oh, you found a gigantic ocean liner.

Why can't you find a necklace? Well, probably in the same sort of area.

It probably just right. It's probably hasn't like reached the bottom of the ocean. Yeah, no one saw that movie unless it was tumbling down. It somehow got wrapped around a turtles neck who then, you know, like an airstream to we're gonna head of ourselves here.

A turtle. I was furious when I found this out. I punched and kicked the coffin.

Okay, just the coffin at the the don. No, I couldn't get it open. Well, not the granddaughter Lizzie. No, no, she's a lovely woman.

I'm sure.

She's she's very lovely woman. Well, really? I've flirted with her quite a bit. Really?

Yes, I did. How was she receptive to that? Or no, she just she was tolerant of it.

But you didn't like rip open her top like Scott suggested.

No. Okay.

Because that's apparently his move. I knew what flirting was and what flirting wasn't.

It's really not hard to tell the difference actually very simple.

So you kicked the coffin. This is in full in full view of the mourners. Yeah, I screamed and yelled.

I said, can you believe this lady committed a sin of omission? Never told me that she had this necklace the whole time. And everyone just they were stifling laughter.

Let me ask you this. Sure. Don't you think people knew about this because they everyone is seeing the movie Titanic? Everyone in that at that funeral knew about it. No one had told me.

And these are people I considered my friends. You can sit.

The granddaughter, the acquaintances of of Rose to be your friends. We were on that boat for a long time listening to this woman tell that story. How long was it because if for in movie two and a half hours too long.

So you consider someone you listen to a story for two hours?

They're your best friends.

We all bonded. We all became fast friends and kept in touch all these many years.

Well, Brock, we're coming up on a break here. I feel terrible for you.

I don't think you do. I feel terrible for you. I think that you do.

Thank you. I feel nothing. I simply fulfill my responsibilities. How do you feel about that?

I feel great. I'm neutral. Okay. So is there anything else you wanted to say about the situation before we go to a break? I just want to say if anyone finds the cordilla mayor, the heart of the ocean necklace, if it washes up on shore, if you're swimming in a turtles neck, if it's around a turtle's neck, if a dolphin is like bouncing it around for fun, that belongs to me. I want that necklace. Someone say finders keepers. Do you abide by those kind of rules? You are a treasure hunter. What do you know? I obviously don't. But you're the finder usually. I'm calling dibs on that. I came as close as anyone's ever going to come. Well, she, Rose was closer. It was around her stuff. She didn't find it. It was given to her.

She wasn't searching for it.

So if something is given, then it's their possession. What are you doing?

Were you doing? Isn't it in someone's dreams? Finders keepers.

I could find it. Yes. It's not that dream about it. I could find it.

Now I feel the time has come to ask you. Yes. Can you give me the heart of the ocean?

I can give you a dream of the heart of the ocean. I could give you a very vivid dream of it.

Can you give me the address of the person who dreamed it?

Look here, in my hands, this is the heart of the ocean. Yes, is it not? The heart of the ocean.

This is your dream of it from your memories. The cord of the mare. Touch it. Touch it. Maia.

Two, please. Up it snakes.

That's funny. Good dream joke. They all beat you. They all beat you on the fingies.

Yep. Good little dream move. That's a dream. Snakes. Each bite in one of my fingers.

All right. Number 13. Good stuff. Can I ask about Brock love it? By the way, after that clip, Tawny also comes in. Tawny Newsom comes in playing the rumbtum tugger from the musical Cats, which was making us laugh a lot. Unfortunately, we don't have time to listen to all of that.

It's bonoodles. But let's talk about Brock love it. How did you get the inspiration for Brock love it? I think I accidentally did a, not accidentally, but I suddenly did a Bill Paxton impression for some reason. Were you talking about Bill Paxton or were you watching the book? Bill Paxton came up. I interviewed him for For Speak Easy. My web series. Yes.

How was he as an interview? He was fine. He was fine. He's like, you know, he was a Texas guy. He liked to tell stories. And so, he was one of those interviews where it's like, I think I asked three questions. For me, that is the perfect interview. It's like, you go right ahead. But he was a very nice man. And I think I was relating some story and I did it brief impression of him. And I was like, oh, that's actually not difficult to do.

And so, when you're talking to someone too, or it's, I guess, easier to do in a, like, if I were to just go up to you and name any random person, say like, Shursh A Ronin.

Do a Shursh A Ronin right now. It's me, Shursh A Ronin.

But if you're listening, I love Brooklyn. But if you're listening or watching a movie of hers, or you're talking to her in person, it's probably easier to just break one out because you're like in that rhythm. So you break it off. So you did this several years ago, you did this impression, and then you just said, yeah, it never occurred to me to do it on the show. And then, I think I had reached a point. I mean, the, the, here's a little, how the bread is made. Okay.

Here we go. Doing characters, sometimes, even if you have, you've come up with a wide variety of characters to choose from. If you're, you know, appearing on the show regularly, I got to a point, and I know that other people have gotten this point too, where you just kind of hate all your character. Who? You're sick. I'm not going to say tell me you hate their character. Blow up. I'm not going to blow up. There's never allowed back on the show.

Because it's like you have to, you have to come up with a new story for them every time. It depends, depending on the type of character that it is. And so it becomes like, I just don't feel like doing any of those voices. I don't feel like doing any of those people. Like Cake Boss. Our old friend, our old friend buddy of Alastair. Will he never return?

Well, he probably will at some point.

Yeah. You just need to put him to bed for a while until you're not tired of him.

You lie down. Here's what I say to my characters. You lie down. You lie down for a little bit, honey. You lie down in the bed. Don't die. Don't die. You lie down in the bed. Don't die.

So I don't know what made me think to do it on that occasion. But I think I might have had a discussion with somebody about the movie Titanic. Right.

And how if that were a real character, how mad he would be if he watched the movie Titanic and saw what a dick move that is that she throws the thing into his ocean. Yeah, Colossal Waste of his time. All right. Well, it was a very funny clip and I would love to talk to Rock again. I had forgotten that he existed until I listened to these back. But I would love to talk to him again. You never know. I know I'm not making requests, but him and Sully Solenberger or two that I. Sully's told the word. It's been a while. Would love to see return. Yeah. Speaking of returns, we are going to return after these messages. And we are going to be playing the clip of what you voted on to be your number 12 episode. You did this. This is the best of Comedy Bang Bang 2018. We'll be right back. Comedy Bang Bang 2018. And a very happy Christmas Eve. Very happy Christmas Eve to you. It is, I hope that you're gathered with your loved ones or ignoring your loved ones as you listen to this on Christmas Eve. I like the idea that someone's listening to this while their family is in the other room together. Yeah. Yeah.

And you're just out of your budget. Yeah. Yeah. You want to listen to these Paul F and Scott. Shut up. Shut up, grandma.

That's a little Napoleon time. Let me see if I can do it to Pauline Diamond.

Is that Beavis? Ah, it's Beavis. You're right. I get that.

I get that. I think you were doing about it. No, but it's. Oh, no, you're right. I was doing this. This is Beavis.

Cone, Cone, Cone, Oleo, Fire, Fire, Cone, Ole. He liked fire.

T.B. for my bongol. He liked T.B. for his bongol. He liked fire until it was suddenly unsafe for him to like fire. Then he liked fire no longer. The Beavis story. Was there an episode where he didn't stop liking fire? No, I just think they had to phase that aspect out of his personality, perhaps as someone set a fire after watching the cartoon.

How would they know? Like they said, like, how was this a little kid? I think it was a little kid. First of all, fire is something that mankind needs in order to survive. We need it. We need it.

It's one of the elements.

It's an instructional video in order to teach man how to make fire. What if Beavis had been like wind, wind? That would have been safe. They would have set up some sort of hydroelectric wind turbine or something. But by the time they're doing that, they're going to be caught. They'll get caught.

You know what I mean? Exactly. Yeah. Terrible tragedy. I don't know whatever happened to that person, but no toilet for you.

All right, let's get to your number 12. Number one, two.

All right. This is the number 12 episode. And we just heard from previously, we heard 558.

Then we heard 532. This is 565.

Solidly in the 500s. So about seven weeks after the ship of love episode, which if that were in July, this would put us somewhere in September, I would imagine. So this is an episode called Come on, Bake Bake. Come on, Bake Bake. This is an episode with our good friend Jason Manzukis, who currently stars in the long-dumb road, which you can get on iTunes and other places, I believe.

And it also has Mary Holland, the very funny Mary Holland.

And it has Darcy Cardin, whom you can see on The Good Place on NBC right now as Janet. She's terrific. She is terrific. You will not be hearing her on her on this clip, unfortunately, because we are going to focus on Mary's segment. But she was there. She was there listening and you can hear her laugh in the background.

Yes, a little later after this clip, Darcy plays a girl from my past. But let's hear this clip.

She's a woman's liver laughing in background. Very good.

Thank you. Very good.

Woman laughing in background. I think that's it for me. I think I'm going to...

You're done? You can do the rest of these yourself, right?

I guess I could.

I'm never going to top that. Okay. See you later. All right.

Scott, this has been a pleasure.

Please, before you go, don't overturn the table. There's a lot of expensive equipment on this.

Oh, I kind of feel like I should. Not an anger. Oh, not an anger, but in victory. Yeah!

Oh, dear. All right, let's listen to this. Mary Holland plays Eugenia Wobbles.

Who is a baking reality show judge. This is your episode 12.

All right, let's get to our first guest. She is an amateur chef. Please welcome Eugenia Wobbles.

Great British baking show. Is that your catchphrase?

No. Are you on that? I was on the great British baking show.

I'm a baker.

As a condition woman. Yeah. I was on the great British baking show. Are you clarifying something?

Or why did you shout at the minute that you were introduced?

Oh, because I love to bake.

You know my children. You shouted it because you loved a bake. Got it. Got it.

My children are all grown up. Oh, wow. So, see you're an older woman.

I'm an older woman than I'm British. I mean, she could be 38. She could be 32.

For all we know. 99. 99. 99. That's as many problems as KZ had.

I live in a cottage. Okay. And I have butter. I have a flower garden and I smell like skin.

What do we got? We got butter. You smell like skin? Yes. I have butter. A flower garden.

Those are those of your possessions. You're like an opposite of a hoarder. You have butter in a flower garden. A flower garden. I smell like skin and that's it. You smell like skin.

Can I smell it? Oh sure. I take a whiff. Yeah, that's skin.

That's the skin smell.

All right. I never tell a lie. I'm British. It's interesting you smell like British skin. Isn't it true?

It smells like cottled jam and a bunch of pudding flops.

And if you know it. Cottled jam and a bunch of pudding flops.

And I'm so excited to be here because this is short. Your excitement is bubbling over a lot like a like a pot that has a you know water in it is boiling. I don't know. I'm trying to make an analogy over to your baking but yeah.

Bob's your uncle. Oh yes. What does that mean? I've heard that so many times. It means it's so simple. All you have to do is think about it. Okay. Okay.

Got it. Okay. And that's all I'll say.

Now. Were you gonna? Were you gonna help us figure out other common British phrases, the meanings of them? Yeah. Well, I can certainly do that.

I can help you with that of course. But I'm here because this is come on bake bake. Yes. And I'm here. This show? Oh no. This is comedy.

Bang. No CBB. Come on. Bake. Bake. So you all you saw was CBB and you got that close to it. Yeah.

And do you think the first word is see a postrophe M O N?

Come on. Bake. Bake. Bake. I don't know.

You're an American. I had you. Just if it was come on. Bake.

Bake. It would be like. Yeah.

Like Ty Cobb or like corn on the. Yeah. I don't know.

But calm a corn on the. You know, I know someone who makes Cobb houses in Britain. Really?

In Brighton, Britain. What are Cobb houses? I don't quite know what that is. Cobb houses. It's a mixture of mud and water and straw. Wait. So slightly watered down dirt. What's that? Slightly more watered down dirt. Yes. Dirt was strong. This sounds like a very this does not sound like it's up to code. These these houses. No, no, no. Very steady.

And it keeps the heat in and it keeps the cold out. It's like a dobe. Is that a dobe? It's like a dobe.

I hardly know. What do you mean?

What do you mean by that? Exactly. Adobe. Adobe reader.

Adobe reader.

That's go ahead. Anyway, that's just a little joke. Very little. Did you want to update it?

No, no, no. No, you don't want to update your Adobe reader.

And also, I don't know what that is.

I don't have a computer. I don't have to update Adobe reader. It's like it was fine. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, you know, well, you know, well, you know how to read. You know how to read. What's there to update? Exactly. So you thought this was a competition baking show. Yes. Yes. Did you bring some of your equipment? Of course I did. I brought a spoon full of flour. I brought orange sauce.

Tiny amount of flour. I brought a spoon in a cup.

Okay. Great. So you have one spoon full of flour. Some orange what now? Orange sauce. Orange sauce.

What is orange sauce? Is that like orange chicken sauce? No, no, no, no. It's orange sauce.

It looks orange. It tastes orange. It's orange sauce. So it's like orange that's been, you know, juiced or something like that? No, it's orange that's been masticated. Oh, it's chewed orange. I'm masticated in myself. Yes. So you spit a masticated orange into a cup? Yes, yes, yes. And then you add a little water like a cob house.

And you build it all together and it keeps the heat out and the cool in. Oh, okay.

It's the sauce of the cake. Anyway. And so I came on here because I'm just desperate. You see, I have my life is just so weird that, you know, my children are all grown up. Oh, they all sure.

Yeah. I would imagine what age did you have your children when I was 19. Oh, wow. Yeah. So, but they're still with us. They must know. No, no. When you say all grown up, you mean fully grown, meaning daily. I mean, fully grown, having lives full lives and died. Okay. All of the natural causes. That's as old as they're going to be. Why did you have to say natural causes?

That's like, yeah. No, no, no. I'm just saying they died of natural causes. Your eyes are starting back in the 50s. So shifty. Can I ask you a question, you genie of wobbles?

Did you win your season of Great British Bake Off? Or are you allowed to say? No, damn it. No. Oh, that's strong language. I should have won. I should have won. Were you, did you not impress Mary Berry or Paul Hollywood? I didn't impress them. It was cake week. And I made a mouth cake for my showstopper. It was a cake in the shape of an open trap. Yeah. And they said. A trap meaning like a trap door or like a mouth trap. A mouth trap. A mouth trap. Sure. So, if like a snap and a little cheese. Oh, a mouse trap. Wait, you have a lisp? You're trying to say mouse trap. Obviously, she has a lisp. I only have a lisp when I say mouse. Oh, got it. You just said mouse. It's just one of my little quirks. I'm a quirky British woman. So, I made a cake in the shape of a mouth trap. Yeah. And of course, I had a little bit of cheese in it. Yeah. Of course, how about a little cake shaped mouth? No, no, no. It was sort of, it was like, I guess I didn't really do the job. I guess it wouldn't be a mouse wouldn't be in the shape of a cake. It would be vice versa. A mouth shaped cake. It was a mouth shape. Well, you see, I guess, blah, blah, blah, my creak creak creak. Cut to the chase. Oh, my God. Oh, wait. Holy cow.

Fertation. What is happening? Are you okay? Are you having a stroke? Eugenia. Excuse me.

Oh, do I just press fast forward? Miss Waffles? I have a hard time. Here's the thing about me.

I lisp when I say the word mouth and I have a hard time pronouncing creak creak creak creak.

Oh, okay. Because I don't like creteaks. Oh, got it. Oh, okay. A little, a little dramatic stress disorder from Great British Bake Off. Holy wood. Can you say criticism? Criticism. Okay, we just switched to that. No, no, no. Because it wasn't a critique. Oh, you just said it. You did it.

Wow. It's over. It's over. If you forgot that you had that problem. That's not at all what happened.

What a miracle. Anyway, what they said was it was that my cake wasn't a cake at all. It was a pudding.

Oh, what's the difference? I never know when they talk about pudding. Pudding is is floopy and cake is floppy. Got it. Got it. Those are baking terms. Yes, you would have a viewer of the show.

I know. Yeah. Flupie V floppy. That's right. So I made a flopie mouth trap that had cheese in the middle of it. I should have made a floppy mouth trap.

That's what I didn't know. And then, and they said they tasted it. Do you know what they said?

What did they say? No. I didn't watch that season. What did they say? They said, this is sour.

Sour. Oh, wow. What in it was sour? What were the ingredients? Well, I put, I put hard boiled eggs.

Okay. The things that make you fart.

Just in the cake. I put minced thyme. Okay. And by that, I don't mean to herb. I mean the concept of thyme. Yes. I took a clock and I just did it. Oh, gosh. Okay. Yes. So like metal shavings.

Yeah. Yeah. But also not sour. Well, yeah. We haven't gotten to the sour parts yet. And I put in. Is this a family recipe? This is my own creation. So, no, it doesn't exist. No, no, no one in my family baked. So everything so far has been savory or metal.

So, get to the sour part. That's my style.

So, the sour part was what I did was I took a lemon. Okay.

Well, listening. I took a lemon.

We're hooked in. I threw it in the trash. Oh, did it see that coming? Twisk. Just like Ian did with his cake in season three. Wow. Right. Through it right in the bin. Why are your eyes starting back and forth again? No, I know Ian in season three. Wait, are you the old grandma who took his cake out of the fridge? And like, no, that's not me. I didn't do that. Her name wasn't Eugene.

He wobbles. Anyway. Yeah. And then, and then of course, I added in some cinnamon. Sure. Is that sweet? A little bit of vanilla. Okay. Also sweet. And then I made, of course, my sponge, my sponge for my pudding. Yes, of course. But this is, you know, everything that's for my pudding cake.

Yes. And everyone's like, that's flappy. That's flappy. I'm putting flops. You need flue beans. Also, a bunch of pudding flops, if you remember. Yes.

Yes. I got it. I got it.

Oh, are you all right? Well, is there another word you can't say? Oh, yeah. No, no, I don't have to rush. You don't have to rush. Slow down. And, um, and so, and so, yes, and so does it. So, those, so those ingredients. And then I put in, and then I put in a pepper pepper. A ghost pepper.

All right. That's very spicy. But also savory. And then I, and then so far, I will say this cake, nay pudding sounds delicious. Others in the metal shavings, which might slice up your guns. Other than the indigestible metal shavings. Well, well, well, don't knock it till you've tried it.

And then the mince. The minced timepiece. And then I put in a car charger. Yeah.

A car charger. You know, a car charger. Like for an electric car. Yeah. No, a charger for your phone. Oh, I see. Oh, oh, oh, yeah. And then I put in some sour patch kids. Oh, here we go.

Sour patch kids. How and what was the ratio of sour patch kids to? 100%. Oh, wait. So, all the other ingredients were not in it. It was just sour patch kids. Those are the things I thought about putting in it. I just gave them a dish full of sour patch kids.

Oh, okay. And they said that was a pudding. I said that was a pudding. Well, you were trying to make a cake trying to say you were trying to make a moustache cake. You said they called it a pudding.

Yeah. And then you said you've done a bowl of sour patch kids. Don't think about it too much.

Everything I say is true. Yeah, you have PTSD from. Yeah.

Oh, funny stuff. Oh, funny equals money. That's true, man.

That's fucking true. And she is rich with laughter. Rich is creases. Rich is creases. Who is creases again? He invented creases pieces.

The rich is candy big. Eclipsing Mr. Wonka himself. That's right. That loony bird.

All right. Let's go to a break. When we come back, Paul and I will be still remaining to countdown these episodes and we will play the episode number 11 for you.

This is comedy bang bang. We'll be right back.

Comedy bang bang. Comedy bang bang. Best of 2018. Be O T O 1 8.

Be O T. I thought you were spelling power bottom for a second.

Evan, he's a Scrooge notorious power bottom. Oh, just like stadium.

Spell power bottom. What if what just as a prank one day, just as a more hand just just just just just as a prank new rule on a wheel of fortune.

Pat say Jack and Vanna White are waiting to come out on stage and the producer says to everyone in the crowd, okay, instead of shouting wheel of fortune this time, we're going to shout out and spell power bottom just as Pat say Jack comes out. So here's what happens. You're going to they come out. You're going to you're going to chant power bottom. Then we're just telling you we're not telling Pat and Vanna. Every puzzle is going to spell a power bottom. Every single one.

And but we're going to change the description of the clue each time like thing Pat is.

That's right. Or or fate. What are some of their other clues like famous in the news or something like that? Sure. Do they do in the news power bottom? That would be what a wonderful world that would be. I would live in that world. I want to go to there.

30 Rock. That's right.

Were you ever on 30 Rock? Nope. Neither was I. We are not New York actors.

No, however, I lived in New York for a year. That's right.

And you could have. I could have. I never the most embarrassing thing. This is a career shame for me.

Lived in New York for a year.

Never even got asked to audition for a law in order. Law in order. Not any of them.

Did you announce to the law and order various spin-offs and main show that you were arriving in New York or are presenting them with my car? They track this, right? They I they talk to the border security. I visited their offices. I presented them with my calling card. I said, I am in I am in town for one for calendar year. Well, at that time, it was an indeterminate amount of time. I would imagine. Yeah. Your show got canceled.

This is what I mean. I should have realized.

What's so funny was that experience was like, you know, it's going to be for at least a year.

Yeah, at least. All right. All right. We'll figure it out.

And then as soon as the year was up, canceled and Jane, like, let's get off. I got it. It's GTFO.

Let's say goodbye to the Statue of Liberty.

I'll tell a friend for the place. That's our good friend Al Pacino. Is that our bad friend?

Which movie was that from? That's from you take a flamethrower.

He takes a flamethrower to play. If he were the man he was 30 years ago, he'd take a flamethrower to this place.

In which place? The restaurant? The court of law. Court of law. He's in a court in the sense of a woman?

Yes. Yes. Does every Al Pacino movie just like finagle him into a court so he can scream at someone?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're out of order. Yeah. This vending machine is out of order.

Does he appear in court in Dick Tracy? He probably, he should. Yeah. He should probably get arrested and just yell the judge. He does in devil's advocate, certainly.

He raps the dealer law. Isn't he a lawyer that? Yeah. That's based on a pun. That's a dream of Jeannie pun based pitch. It's the same people.

The I dream of Jeannie. The TV team. The TV team. Maybe devil's advocate. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

Makes sense with the rising painting. I don't remember it.

Opening. You don't you don't intimately remember every scene from the devil's advocate?

That's another opening nighter.

So excited that I don't remember a single thing from and I have never seen any of it ever again.

Is that good? Do you think you should see every movie twice even something that's not good just so you can remember why it was so bad? Yes. And so you can give it a fair shake.

A fair, has there ever been a movie where you were like, this is a piece of shit. And then you watch it again and go, I was wrong. Yeah. Boondock Saints.

Boondock Saints. When I first watched it, I thought this is very stupid. And then when I watched it again, I was like, I was wrong. It's brilliant. All right. We need to get right enough. That's enough out of you. You were talking to your hat there. Yeah, it's enough out of you. You didn't hear him? Well, who makes that hat?

I'm trying to read upside down. I can't. This is from the Wellama Hat Company. Wellama. Yes.

This is where is where is well. My base. A bespoke hat, dear boy. And I see your name in there. Yes.

It says Paul. Mr. P F. Tump. Mr. P F. Tomkins. That's me, by the way. Where are they based?

Altadena, California. Altadena, California. Go get all of your bespoke hats. He's made several hats for me that gentleness. Has he really? Yes, he has. And do you think he really makes some or does he just call China? Go get to work. I think he goes China. Yeah.

Jiggy China. Speaking of Thomas Middleton. Going China. Oh boy.

All right. Let's get to our next clip. This is your episode 11. Number one. One.

All right. This is number 11. 14, 13, 12, 11. We did it. We did it. Good as our word.

And this is, let's see, we started with 558, then we went to 532, which is about in February.

This is 524, even earlier than February. And this, and look, this is apropos for the day that today is, if you're listening to this on the day it's released. I am. This is Christmas Eve.

And this is an episode called Mary Chunky Christmas.

Mary Chunky Christmas. Let me tell you about the people involved.

Let me tell you about the people involved. We have Neil Patrick Harris.

NPH. NPH who, before appearing on this show, I did not know was is a big fan of comedy bang bang.

And in fact, was doing a promotional tour for downsizing, I believe.

And wow, yeah. His, I think so. Forgot about that movie.

And his publicist, he told his publicist he wanted to do comedy bang bang, and his publicist, like most public, I found most publicists do not take this show seriously. And.

No, should they? No, should they? And they entertain the idea of their client doing it for a while and get me all excited about it. And then we schedule it.

And then approximately one day.

Then the client listens to the show. No, the client never listens to the show, nor knows that this is on his or her schedule. But, and the publicist will get everyone excited about this client doing the show. And then about 24 hours in advance will say, oh, they don't have time anymore.

Their schedule changed. And all of the work that I've done in booking people, you the other guests and all that is all for not. And that it looked like that was going to happen with Neil on this show, because I heard that he was, I heard he was a fan and you can never really take that as gospel. Exactly. But I did hear that rumor and because this is Hollywood, all the time we're saying, Oh, I love what you do. We hate it. We hate everyone else's work.

I we hate what our friends become successful. Oh, Morrissey.

So this was on my schedule and I had booked you guys for a while. And then suddenly I think about it. I think about 24 hours in advance. The publicist said, Oh, Neil's schedule changed and he no longer can do it. And I said, the old refrain. I said, of course, I understand. And then, but then it got put back on the schedule because Neil saw it taken off his schedule. Oh, fuck.

And he said, Wait a minute. I want to do comedy bang bang.

And he really wanted to do it. Oh, which was very, very nice of him. So and then he fired his publicist on air on air. And he hired me as his publicist. And my only idea for publicity is to talk about this story.

So in this episode, Paul, you play the other people involved are it's Neil Patrick Harris, yourself, Paul of Tomkins and Sean Distan. That's right.

Sean Distan who has made quite a splash this year, quite a splash. As a lot of people's favorite, one of their favorite performers.

And as he calls himself self professed fan favorite, this is the first episode in which he plays self professed fan favorite Rudy North. That's right. This is the very his day, his character debut. So let me explain what has happened before this clip.

Now, if you recall, Neil very graciously fit about an hour of the recording into this, but we didn't want to put out an episode. There's just 45 minutes or an hour. So instead, you and I talked as big chunky bubbles for approximately half an hour before he before he arrived.

Yeah, we're not going to hear that.

And then Neil arrived and we talked to him for a while. And then Sean came in and debuted the character of Rudy North. So the people involved, you'll hear big chunky bubbles who is a soup artist, but not the focus of the not the focus of the clip. No, remember, I tried to prepare you for this eventuality. Sure. But the way you you like brought me up first and I made me think that, well, go ahead. Okay. So but you are you do some expert Chinese.

Sure. It's great. So this is Rudy rudimentary north. He is going to talk about his life.

So let's listen to this. This is your episode 11.

So I took to leave Miami and come to a place like Los Angeles and be able to be employed.

Postmates has done me such a favor. Now, you came out here just to work for Oh, yeah. I came out here three or four months ago, just to work for the Postmates corporation.

Did Postmates have a have an ad out saying, Hey, do you want to live in Los Angeles or something?

It was a Craigslist post that I saw that I answered. And at first it was a scam. And it wasn't Postmates. At first it was a scam. You were petrified. I was pet. At first it was a scam.

I was petrified. But it's right. You know, I could believe it. And you know, so basically, wait, did you use it? Did it turn into not a scam on the same phone?

Yeah. No, that's just how I learned about Postmates. Oh, I see. So the first one was a scam.

The first one was a scam. I was petrified. And then I learned about Postmates and decided on my own to purchase a ticket to Los Angeles. Oh my gosh. Where'd you get this ticket? Now, that's a whole story to self-scared. And I can't go into the dirt bag things I did to get this ticket. I did some bad stuff. That's for another episode. I'm glad I'll be back for another episode.

I'll be the judge of that. We'll talk about that next 10 episodes from now. Now, I got here and and I needed a car, Scott. So you did not own one? I did not own a car. So I needed a car. So what I did was I was walking down sunset. Okay. That's a good start. That's a good start.

As one does. And I could see that. Was it time to feel good?

I was walking down sunset. It was time to feel good. And I continued walking down sunset. And I saw a lot of cars passing. And I thought that was an opportunity. So I jumped into traffic. Oh, I jumped into traffic. It was hit by a Toyota Tercelle. Oh, hit. That was hit by a Toyota. I really kind of jumped on the car. Okay. It looked like I was hit going house house. Oh, he was going to clean 60 ups. 60. Yeah. What time of day was it? It was rush hour. Okay. This guy deserves it. Yeah.

That's what I was thinking too. He was driving on the sidewalk. Turns out he was a post based driver too. Complete dirt bag. Okay. But I dirt bagged him out of his car. So I said, you hit me with your car. Let's not have insurance analysts. Give me the keys. This is like real fast in the furious. That's exactly weird. I was like, give me the keys. I want pink slips. Right. And I hurt where you can you hit my car. I was very hurt. Neil is a good thank you for asking. Yeah, I was pretty fucked up. So I got into his car.

And basically because my leg was broken, I pretty much drove around for the next three or four weeks.

But wait, because I'm sorry. I don't get the logic of this.

Could you not move your leg to the break? Well, first of all, did have a place to stay. So, okay. And I also once I was in the car, it was very difficult to get out of the car.

Okay. You know, so that was that was the hard. I see. So that so the not the operating the machinery of the car was okay. That was easy. I just use my left leg.

Okay. But getting out was difficult.

Very hard. So what I did was I took over this man's order.

I delivered his poster. Oh, so he was mid order. He was mid order. I took his order. I usurped his job. Okay. Pretty much using his identity. So this is like a life swap. Yeah, I like swap.

But I'm pretty much. Wow. So when you get hit by a car, you can just life swap with someone. If you got the dirt bag skills I do, Scott, you could do whatever you want. I want to go around trying to hit you with a car. Or no, getting hit by you. Wait, I don't want to. You better be kidding. You don't want my life.

You don't want that. Can I ask a question? Of course, Neil.

Do you know what happened to this guy now? Oh, Neil, I did find out. I did find out what happened.

What is here? Is everything okay for him?

Oh, yeah, he was fine. Is he back in Miami? No, he's no longer working at the Postmates Corporation. Oh, he's working for Lyft. You said that like it was so dramatic. He just was working for Lyft. Now he got another car. I was about to say, you need a car. He went right down to the he went right down to Honda. Why did you say it?

Like, it was this way to be the thing that happened to you guys know that working for these these passenger company, right there delivery companies. You call it a passenger delivery company.

It's not a food delivery. Yeah, exactly. You know me. Now it's those companies are terrible because I'll tell you why, Scott. You don't get to leave your car. I see. Oh, that's true. Okay.

So when you're in Postmates, I've never really thought about that. Yeah, when Postmates, I pull up to the pull up to the restaurant, double park, of course, of course, throw on my hazard. Of course, of course, I put on my hazards and I run in, right? So let's my has he's on. Let's say I'm going to sugarfish, right? Sure. Throw my has he's on a running to sugarfish. I grabbed the sushi. I don't know. I'm grabbing it so fast. Quite honestly, the sushi sloshed around at the back by the time it gets to the house. That's what it's not good. It's not good. It's not good. No, I know. I'm not good at that. But what I do is I get to be out of the car.

I get to communicate with people in the restaurant. And then how what are you? What are you saying to these people in the restaurant? You're doing it so fast. Oh, yeah. I'm doing I'm saying stuff like what's up? What's up, Charles? How y'all doing? Okay. How y'all doing in the back? That kind of thing. Okay. A lot of greeting. A lot of crowd work. Yeah. I say like a lot of people here tonight.

A lot of people. Wow, what a crowd.

I say stuff like that. Okay. To the kitchen crew. To the kitchen crew. I say any of you all from out of town and a lot of them are from out of town. Anybody celebrating anything to me? Anybody celebrate a lot of anniversaries in the sugarfish kitchen and and because kitchen. Mm hmm. I thought this was to the people eating. Oh, no, no, no. People in the back. I don't interact with the people in the back. I'm a man of the people. Scott. Okay, God. You know, you saw me come in. I said hi to Brett. I shook his hand. I said, Hey, Brett, how did you do Brett? I taught my man of the people. I get that sense about it. Okay. So I talked to the people in the back and then guess what, Scott? Now I'm delivering your food. Right.

I get to get back in my car. You're back in the car. Much like a Lyft driver. Much like a Lyft driver. But I had that fresh air for a second, you know? And then once you get to the place. Oh, well, no, no, no. There's many steps before that. Oh, sorry. Sorry. I don't mean to before this along course, of course. I beg your pardon before that. And of course, Neil knows because you're a big fan before that once I get the food, I like to give you a call. You'll just even know what Postmates is 10 minutes ago. This is all new to me. Neil, wait. Now hold on. Now you might not know this, Neil, but your assistants have ordered Postmates for you many times. Really? You don't remember me? I remember the sugarfish.

You don't you remember the Schlosser and I bag is sugarfish?

Yeah, I actually do. I was kind of pissed off about that. Neil, I can't believe you don't remember me. That was you. We had a whole interaction now. I was like, what the fuck is up with my sugarfish? And we did fist fight for a few minutes. I remember this. I said, what's up with my sugarfish? And I said, fuck you, and I just threw a punch. Why you threw first hit me in the throat?

Yeah, I went right for the throat. Oh my God. Why the throat first? It's called a dirt bags handshake. Okay, that makes sense.

You just you chop to the throat or punch to the throat. Got it. I really flew off the handle very quickly. But then you know what? I said, I'm sorry. And I asked if you could use the bathroom.

I said, I can't use your bathroom. And then you just and then you said, of course, of course.

It was a weird voice. But I took it. I took it as politeness.

I know you play a lot of characters.

Bleeding from the throat. Oh, right. I forgot to do it. And then just chillies coming out into his bathroom. And then yeah, I made the fudge in your bathroom for a few minutes. I'm surprised you don't remember me, Neil. I respect now. Neil, I did want to talk to you about this because I did check my rating afterwards. Yeah. And I did get four out of five stars.

Four. That's that seems appropriate. Generous. That doesn't even seem appropriate to me. That's like your mean. I don't want to get. Well, listen, if you give if you give two or three stars, there's a problem. You know what I mean? It sounds to me like there's a punch. I got punched in the throat. You know, Neil, you must have such an interesting life that stuff like this happens to you so often that you don't remember it. Have you ordered sugarfish before? Yes, of course.

And have you ever had a problem when they came and? I haven't been punched in the throat regarding.

Wow. You don't remember me? I think I think you may have the crazy way. You delivered to me as well.

Wow. I can't believe. Yes, of course, Scott. I have delivered to you. It wasn't sugarfish.

I remember the food. Usually I don't remember the word. It was Mendocino Farms. Oh, Mendocino Farms.

Yeah, I get that salad. You get the salad with the grilled chicken. Yeah. The grilled chicken, right? And you had a problem that there was no grilled chicken in your salad. Well, it's the grilled chicken salad. Of course, I have a problem. I told you, Scott, someone cut me off on the street and I took the little strips of grilled chicken out and I was throwing it into their car through the window. And you needed to understand that's part of the delivery process. I'm defending your orders. And what did I do? I don't really recall. Well, you turned around. I punched you in the butt.

You punched me in the butt, right? You don't remember? You don't remember? I hear you writing the glute. That seems weirder than a throat punch, Scott. I guess you're. I'm so tall. I did go for the I did go for the throat. You were going for this, how tall you were. Neil was standing in a in a trench when I punched him, but you were not. I went for the neck right in the butt. Yeah. Can't believe you don't remember that, Scott. Unless it's the actual butthole. I don't, you know, you don't remember. This thing's kind of like a crazy. Yeah. Do you remember what Scott's rating was for you?

Yeah. Scott gave me four and a half out of five stars. And I do want to say I'm not happy about these rating. You don't like four and a half? I'm a perfectionist. Look, like much like big juggy bubbles over here. Much like big juggy bulbs. I'm a perfectionist. Right. I don't really think that's something true. You can say about big juggy bubbles.

How dare you? You ain't seen you ain't seen the soup, but what's got? You've seen my eye. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I've seen I've driven past your if you delivered soup to him. Oh, yeah. I did want to.

I yes. Do you not remember that big chunk?

I do remember. Of course he does because he is a gentleman.

I gave me five stars. You gave me five stars. And I did give you a little bit of a titty twister.

That's right. But my request. Yeah.

Yes. I came by and I was falling asleep. Yeah. I had some Joe's on third. And I said, big chumpy big chumpy big. I got you some soap. I got you some soup and some soap from Joe's on third.

He wasn't sure if I said soap bubbles or soup bubbles. So I got both because I'm a perfectionist.

The Jones on third soap is really great. It's so good. It's good. So yeah. And then and then he said, wow, thank you so much. Can you deliver me a titty twister right now? And I'll how polite.

Why are you more polite to him than you are to me when he's in the service industry?

I'm sort of performing a service here. Really?

All right. I mean, Scott to be honest, I don't know if you could have the little job like Postmates. I don't I don't know that I want one. I mean, it seems to be. It's not about want.

Scott, I'm saying I don't know if you could handle it. Okay.

What are the requirements?

All right. First of all, you got to have a car.

Okay. I do have one of those. So is that it? I mean, maybe you could handle it.

That's all. That's one requirement. I didn't think about it because yeah, yeah, you know what? You could probably handle it, Scott. You have a car.

Well, I have to say Rudy. And I knew your name. I didn't have to look down at my notes.

It seemed as though it's a nondescript name.

Really? Nor is it for such an interesting person. Well, that's what I do want to talk about that because the the this whole interesting is person thing.

That was a lot of pressures.

That's what I'm sorry. I don't mean to put that on. That's more of a Neil thing.

Yeah, I don't know if I find one of the most interesting is the people.

I don't know if I'm that interesting. I mean, yes, I'm a mortal.

Can you be clearer in the way you said that immortal immortal or immortal?

I don't know if we have time for that. I know we don't think we do.

We might have to talk about another podcast about that.

We're running out of time. That's the beer. This is when you bring this up.

That's when you drop that bomb. I wanted to talk about Postface.

Ah, funny stuff. Funny stuff. Funny stuff. Now, that is the just the beginning of the lore of Rudy rudimentary North. The Postmates employee professional dirt bag constantly postponing, telling me all the details.

Who is the more talented?

Is immortality in his life. The throat punching is established here.

You can hear him sort of like what's interesting is is now he is refined this character to a degree over the past year in his many appearances where some things that he accidentally says in that clip. Like throat punching, I think, was just something that came up out of the blue. That wasn't something he planned on necessarily. That's become full canon, as he says. So it's interesting to hear the beginnings of a character like that.

Well, also the throat punching became a magical thing.

Yes. At first it was just a way to disable someone so you could take their stuff.

Also, he starts off the clip just saying that he took over their life. He doesn't say he throat punched them. That comes up a little later in the clip of how he did it. And the immortality was just something he rifed there. But that's it's great to hear the first appearance of a character that has become such a wonderful addition to the show.

All right. That is all right. All right. All right. Look, look, this is what we said was going to happen. And this is what happened. We're not breaking any promises promises made promises kept. We said we would go down 14 13 12 11 and we did it.

And we did it in the order that we said we would do it in the order we said we would do it.

Now, I do want to we're going to we're going to be back on Thursday and we're going to be counting down 10 9 8 and 7 10 9 8 and 7.

But before we do that, I want to leave the episode. We've had many wonderful musical guests, musical guests over the past year. And I wanted to highlight one of them. And we'll take you out with this. We have Mr. Heavenly was on at the end of the previous year. That is the band that engineer Brett plays in. And they did a it is Christmas Eve.

So I wanted to play a little song that they played on our Christmas episode last year that has a little bit of holiday flair to take us out. It's called the wandering Jews Christmas. I don't think it is. But let's hear from that Mr. Heavenly. And we will see the rest of you the rest of you. We'll see the rest of you. I guess everyone other than Mr. Heavenly. They're not going to be listening. We will not see you this Thursday. We'll not see you this Thursday. The rest of you we definitely will see. We will see you on Thursday for part two of our countdown. Thanks for listening everyone. Take it away Mr. Heavenly.

R.I.B.

Yeah. Tryin' the sky so we'll mask our heart in the front side. No car down the endless night.

Rubbing the flow kids rolling a hallway.

Oh and I.

Nobody's home answering the phone. You said you weren't about it but all your love that told me.

And you got on the T.I. and I got zero feelings on it.

Yeah. We'll take off on some minus. Woah. Woah. Woah.

Yeah.

We'll see you in the lights. Tryin' the sky so we'll mask our heart in the front side.

No car down the endless lights. You spell them. You caught a whistle.

We'll take open the body for two minutes.

Nobody's home answering the phone. You said you weren't about it but all your love that told me.

Bein' your bonnet you got all the T.I. and tryin' out. I got zero feelings on it. Give all dirt but all my money.

Needy dawgs craving some affection but all I get is a little bit of affection.

Nobody's home now we'll never find no. Here's a young band I think I'm on the sign of.
