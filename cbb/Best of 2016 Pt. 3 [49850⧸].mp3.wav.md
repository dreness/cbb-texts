♪♪ You've heard of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, but I bet you never heard his fourth law, which was mostly just how to clean their robotic sex holes.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Bernard Shaky, another catchphrase superstar, thank you so much.

And I picked that because of Asimov.

Right.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for the third of our best ofs, third of four.

And if you were listening to, by the way, I'm Scott Ockerman, your host.

And if you were listening...

By the way...

By the way, very important to say.

If you were listening to our previous installment, speaking of Asimov, we sang our wonderful Christmas hit, which took over the nation called Please Don't Joke About I Robot This Christmas.

That's right.

I hope that you sang it with your family around the hearth.

And listen, it's not just for Christmas celebrators.

Nope.

You can also be Hanukkah.

Because it's talking...

Yeah, well that's true.

But also it's not just for Christmas day because it's saying this Christmas don't do that, which can be any time of year from December 26th on.

That's right.

A year-round class.

We can go from December 26th to December 25th.

But no one saved on December 25th.

It's not December 25th.

Not December 25th.

Because it's Christmas already, you doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doy doo.

I'm the Scatman!

Remember that guy?

I know who that's...

This guy called himself the Scatman.

And he has song.

And it's not Scatman, brothers?

It's not Scatman, come on.

How dare he?

Scatman, brothers, was just a Scatman.

He was in D's Scatman.

He made the mistake of not calling himself a Scatman.

He was a Scatman.

Yeah, the Scatman was a guy who had this weird novelty hit where he scatted like crazy.

Okay.

And the backside...

That wasn't sustainable for a long music career.

Well, the backside in the guy was that he was a lifelong stutterer and worked to cure himself of his stutterer or manage his stutterer.

Well, Scatting is the stutterer of music.

Is that...

Do you really feel that way?

I really do feel that way.

I'm sorry.

And I'm sorry if it's just the way I was raised.

You tell it like it is.

You say what's on your mind.

And you say what everyone else is thinking.

And in this PC culture, it's kind of refreshing, isn't it?

PC culture is the biggest threat to America today.

What about Russia?

I mean, that's up there.

But honestly, those red cups, Starbucks, the cupcake Christmas on them.

Usually I like a red cup.

Right?

You know, at some sort of like keg party.

A red solo cup?

Yeah, you know what I mean?

Put my lean in it.

That's a great thing in country songs is...

Monro country songs just name checking things.

Things, yeah.

We all...

These are things that exist.

Yeah, exactly.

Here's things you like.

I like this like that.

I like the other thing too.

Here's some country people from long ago that I talk about.

Yep.

Hint.

By the way, Paul of Tomkins is here.

Hello, Paul.

I am me and I am him.

I like me.

My wife likes me.

You both like you.

That's from a mainstream son of appeals.

Oh, is it?

It's a sad scene with John Keaton.

Oh, yeah.

Rest in power.

He's pretending his wife's still alive, right?

What about rest in poutine for Keaton people?

Hey, I like it.

Rest in poutine.

Poutine.

Wouldn't be poutine.

George, tell me you mustn't say it.

Wouldn't be poutine.

Wouldn't be...

Nagada.

That was the thing that came up a lot on tour with me and Lauren was when he kept doing David Carvey's George.

Why?

I don't remember that.

I don't know why.

It was a thing that would come up periodically.

It wouldn't linger.

Nagada.

But it's Nagada.

It was not like the cranberries.

Well, that was...

They had to.

They had to let it live.

It was compulsory.

Yeah.

It's an Irish thing.

It's in their culture.

Nagada.

So Paul, we are...

It's Monday.

We just had Christmas and of course Hanukkah.

Still going strong.

We were in the throws of Oggy Doggie for a while and now it's in the throws of Honey Doggie.

I hope you're enjoying your honey doggy.

Yes!

I love kosher honey doggies.

Kosher honey doggies.

Oh, every year this time.

Kosher honey doggies.

You gotta be tearing me down.

Did I do Veronica?

Well, I'm glad you asked.

I of course lit the candles.

I said the prayers.

I hope you're a person.

What are your prayers?

Oh, okay.

What are my prayers for Hanukkah?

Yeah.

I hope that things continue to go in a good way for the Jewish people.

That's right.

And what way is that?

Up, up, baby.

Hey.

All the way to the top.

Yep.

Through the roof.

Joseph people.

Jews.

Through the stratosphere.

Jews.

Through the stratosphere.

I like it.

Jews.

Through the stratosphere.

Next year in Israel.

Jews.

Through the stratosphere.

Two great slogans.

It's the natural.

I feel like Jews.

Through the stratosphere is the completion of the phrase.

Next year in Israel.

Jews.

Through the stratosphere.

Jews.

Through the stratosphere.

What knew your Zev coming up, obviously?

What knew your Zev?

Maybe it's much too early in the game, but I don't know.

I thought I'd ask you just the same.

What you do in your Zev?

I turn right back around.

Yeah.

I don't like to let anyone know my location.

Oh, you're very secretive.

I am not going to be in this country.

I'll tell you that much.

Are you worried about murderers?

I am.

Yeah.

I'm mainly worried about manslaughter.

That's why I'm taking along my friend Jessica Fletcher.

I forgot about manslaughter.

It was 8 million years ago that we talked about it.

Oh my God.

Remember when we also taped the Christmas episode?

Christmas episode this morning?

He's not an I have spent a calendar day together.

Oh.

Man's Lottery She Road.

Good stuff.

Hey, I got to talk about it because it's a Christmas tradition.

You got to.

Come on, man.

And we flirted with it a couple episodes.

Lala.

Mr. microphone.

Yes.

The year.

1975.

1978.

I looked it up.

Let me be on.

Okay.

I looked it up.

Scotty.

Can I fill people in on what we're talking about?

For the past couple of best ofs, we have strangely hit upon by mere coincidence.

We talked about the Mr. microphone commercial from the 70s and 80s on two separate occasions for some reason.

And to me, I have to say one thing that I am very disappointed with in the holidays now that was one of my favorite cherished traditions is I would watch the holiday episode of David Letterman and I would look forward to three things.

I would look forward to Jay Thomas coming out and telling the Lone Ranger story.

That's right.

I would look forward to him trying to hit the pizza and meatballs off the Christmas tree with a football and Darlene loves singing like Christmas.

That's right.

No.

Christmas baby, please come home.

Oh, that's right.

So sorry.

Those are the and I would always love to see whatever art direction they did.

I remember one year the person playing saxophone on the saxophone solo, a big giant throne turned around and he was sitting at it and he got up and danced around.

These are the things that I enjoy.

And I realized we had somehow inadvertently hit upon our own Christmas tradition by merely by chance talking about the Mr. microphone commercial on two consecutive best of episodes.

I realized we had to keep it going and I realized we had to and this and here's what it stems from.

There is a phrase in these commercials.

Paul, maybe you want to say exactly what it is.

The phrase is hey, good looking, we'll be back to pick you up later.

Sometimes I'll sometimes wheel and I'll tell you why I know that in previous years and this comes up.

We'll say, hey, good looking.

I'll be back to pick you up later and hey, good looking, we'll be back to pick you up later.

And that just came up two different years and then we broke down the commercial and our problems with it.

Yeah.

I have not seen this commercial in 30 years.

It has just been seared into my brain.

Me too.

And my issue with the Mr. microphone product is this.

I would watch the commercial and this is what I would imagine is that I would be in a situation where I would buy a Mr. microphone.

I would find some good looking women walking down the street listening to their radios and I would turn on my microphone and take over their radio.

And out of their radio, they would hear my voice and I would say, hey, your message, my message, can I be on message and on brand by saying, hey, good looking, I'll be back to pick you up later.

And I was very disappointed when I got a Mr. microphone that it only broadcast, it does not broadcast to random radio signals.

That would be insane.

If you could usurp anyone's radio at any time.

It's not Mr. Pirate microphone.

No.

It's not some sort of Christian Slater pump up the volume situation with pirate radio.

No.

One had to turn their radio to a specific frequency on the radio dial, normally very, very low, some like 86.9, something that no one would be listening to.

Because there's nothing there.

There's nothing there.

And that's why they pick it.

It is attuned to that frequency and say, pick one 0.7 or something like that, something, you know, kiss FM, something everyone is listening to.

But no, they pick it very low on the frequency.

So it only works if you turn your own radio onto this and it will be broadcast on this.

And this was my issue.

I had been watching this commercial for years and years.

And I had- Because they did use the same commercial for a very long time.

For a very long time.

And I had imagined in my mind a situation where I would be throwing my voice like a ventriloquist, a Mr. microphone ventriloquist into other people's radios.

Or like a terrifying big brother who controlled all methods of communication.

Sure, certainly.

One of those.

Yes.

Now, I've talked about my disappointment with the product two years in a row.

And it came to my attention through sharp-eared listeners that the- That the- Bats.

That the commercial does not imply that you would be throwing your voice into another radio.

Yeah.

It implies that you would have your own radio and turn it up so loudly that when you said, hey, good looking, I'll be back to pick you up later.

And Steph Curry, first night.

What are you doing?

Cody.

This is the literally tenth time you have interrupted our show by watching something on the computer while you are supposed to be recording the show.

It's sort of astonishing that you still have a job here.

You're one of our oldest employees.

And I love you.

This is your most reliable trait, by the way.

This is something that you do.

I cannot fathom it.

I am right in the middle of one of our cherished Christmas traditions.

Cody, people look forward to this all year long.

All year long.

And here I am in the middle of it.

People have just gotten their families gathered around the heart.

They're left up.

I'm about to make a mayocopa apology.

This has been a long time coming.

Three years in the make-up.

And now I have to hear about Steph Curry.

What do you have to say for yourself?

I'm so sorry.

Thank you.

That's a start.

And it may be, quite honestly, a finish.

We'll see.

In 2017.

I do not have the power to fire you.

Full disclosure.

No one in the room about how to fire code.

That would explain a great deal.

But look, one can only control one's own radio and one hopes that one has a loud enough radio.

A scripture tells us.

That one can turn it up loud enough to broadcast one's own voice to a good looking woman as one passes by one.

And that would be so distracting to them that they would look up.

One would think that they would have their own radios that they're listening to and not hear something like this.

Although when you are listening to the radio, one should be attuned to the noises around them, especially if there are cars about.

Yeah, if you're walking around carrying a radio.

And holding it right up to your ear.

Sure.

As pop culture in the 80s and 70s showed us.

A lot of people would do this.

Right up to the ear.

It's your responsibility to be alert and aware of your surroundings.

With one ear.

With car sounds.

And even if you're indoors, look, there are a lot of news stories every year about cars crashing into mini-marts, houses.

I saw straight out of Compton.

This guy's very first scene.

Boom.

Right in the living room.

So.

Now, can you imagine you're in your living room, you're listening to your radio.

You're not paying attention to think, oh, I'm in my house.

I'm in my house.

Of course, a car is not going to come crashing through this.

That's what you have to pay attention to the most.

That's what you least expect it.

One ear always for car sounds.

Always for car sounds.

So then what you're going to let yourself be manslaughter and then Jessica Vlittres to come in on her goddamn bike.

She, a hickular manslaughter, she wrote.

That's the gate.

Oh, not this Christmas.

So look, so what happened here is.

It's where it comes to big moment everyone's been waiting for.

I got this news.

I heard, hey, you're wrong about this commercial, which is seared into your brain.

My brain specifically.

My brain.

I've watched so many times I've watched this commercial and that was my impression of the Mr. microphone.

I've come to realize that no.

When you watch the commercial, I pulled up the actual commercial and I think this cannot be the version that I watch so many times.

Here's the version that I remember this year in my brain.

Is there is a young lady walking down the street.

There are three guys in a convertible.

They have a Mr. microphone.

The one guy says, through via his car radio, hey, good looking, we'll be back to pick you up later.

Okay.

So this is the version in my brain too, but the only one, the original that is online, there are two commercials that I found online.

The only one that features a car of gentlemen saying that they never show the women.

They never show the women.

You just see these three assholes.

You just see the.

You're looking back to big young players.

I thought to myself, can that be possible that we are remembering women, beautiful women walking down the street and then this and then them being a reaction?

But maybe here's what's very, I think, a comfort.

How progressive that commercial was back then to not show not to the gender.

The gender they didn't show the gender of the person.

Oh, that's true.

That was a good looking one.

Maybe you're right.

It could be a man could be a woman.

That's true.

That is that is a great.

It allowed you to put yourself in, if I may, the driver's seat.

What if you were that man with the Mr. microphone?

Who's the good looking person you're seeing?

These days it's anything.

Is it a table?

It's like, who knows what people are in love with these days?

I don't know.

I don't think they're yelling at a table.

Maybe he's going and taking.

He's like, hey, good looking.

I'll be back to big young players.

Like people who have put their stuff by the side of the road.

Yeah, yeah.

I don't know.

I think there has to be a later version of this commercial where you see the women.

I think because of here.

I can see it in my mind very good.

I can too, but here's another thing that I found out about this year that the, there is a theory I have always said ever since I was a young man, the Berenstein Bears.

Yes.

Oh, I, yes.

We've talked about this a little.

I talked about this on my show with someone else.

We may have talked about it on tour and that, or maybe we did not talk about it.

I don't remember talking about this with you.

Okay, I've read this, but okay.

So I've said the Berenstein Bears forever.

I was growing up.

I was shocked to find that it is the Berenstein Bears.

Oh, say I thought it was the Berenstein Bears.

Yeah.

Oh, the mummy.

Hold on.

Let's look it up.

Look it up.

Scotty.

Look it up.

It is the Berenstein Bears.

Oh, why does that sound familiar?

It's the Berenstein Bears, but I have always thought it was the Berenstein Bears.

Sure, because that's a name that you've maybe as closer to a name you've heard before.

Yeah.

Now there's a theory online.

Who ends their name in stain?

It's crazy.

There are so many people apparently who think it is the Berenstein Bears spelled S-T-E-I-N, not A-I-N, which is what it is.

There are so many people that think it is the Berenstein Bears that they believe time travelers have gone back in time and changed it to Berenstein Bears.

Why?

And we all still retain our memories.

Why would they do that?

I don't know.

But that is what I think may be happening here with the Mr.

microphone.

In some of you people out there may be able to send us a later version of this commercial.

I'll talk about the later version that I did find in a minute.

But the version that I saw from 1978 is so old and shitty that it can't be the version that we saw so many times as a kid.

Can it?

Why?

Why can't it be?

It starts off, it looks so bad.

It starts off with two just dopes going, Hey, what do you got there?

Oh, Mr. microphone.

Oh, I heard it at.

It's so bad.

Here's all I remember is the guys in the car and the ladies who apparently did not exist.

And the guy with his radio on his shoulder who is walking in the street singing jingle bells.

I don't know about jingle bells.

There's a guy.

There is a an African American gentleman who's like dancing with his ghetto blaster next to his ear and singing into a microphone at one point.

Yes.

I think this I see I think there must be a version from 1983 or so that upgraded all of these scenes that we're just not saying.

Anyway, this is a mystery for next year's best ofs.

Hopefully some people will do a little research.

Now I was like, this can't be the commercial that I've seen.

So I did a little research and I found a a version from 1981 or two, which upgrades the look of the commercial considerably.

It looks like a professional commercial again.

But the Hey, good look in the Hey, good looking.

I'll be back to pick you up later is said by a child on a bike.

Now I think then that's a reference to the original iconic commercial and they were having some fun with it.

They're having some fun where they were saying like, Oh, even kids can be kids.

What a fuck.

Yeah.

And that's what we want to say this Christmas.

Even kids want to fuck.

So let them.

What?

And moms like kids fuck each other.

What if kids just what if it was like one year on January 1st, 2017, every elementary school is a purge scenario.

Yeah, it's not even a perch there.

But it's like on January 1st, everyone said, look, we know it's New Year's Day.

Get your kids in school.

I know they traditionally have it off on January 1st.

Get everyone come to the school because we have something important to say.

And every single principle of every single elementary school said, guys, it's no lot.

We're not going to look down on you guys anymore.

In fact, we encourage you.

All of you kids fuck each other all the time.

All of you small children.

You are free to be sexually active.

Do whatever you want.

We're not there.

No rules anymore.

But look, the only rule is it's got to be consensual.

It's got to be consensual, of course, and have fun.

And have fun.

What do you think would happen?

What do I.

What happened?

And how would they all coordinate?

Parents all go along with this.

Yeah, they all, if all the schools got together and said, it's okay.

Anyway, oh, the other weird part about this.

Anyway, yeah.

The other strange part about this second Mr. microphone commercial is there is a section where it is a group of Hispanic people sitting around and it says, Senor Microfono S numero uno.

Oh, very weird.

And do they are they then singing a song in Spanish?

They're not they're like going, yay, into their own or they're going.

I don't know.

They're just cheering for the Mr. microphone.

Yeah, for the Mr. microphone.

And then there's another scene where a 12 year old girl is at her birthday party and she has a stack of presents and she's opened 10 of them and nine are Mr. microphones and she opens another one and goes, another Mr. microphone.

Yay, and everyone cheers.

That's that.

I think at that point the makers of Mr. microphone were stretching the truth.

Yeah.

Oh, we a little bit.

Come on, guys.

Oh, we a little bit.

Come on, guys.

Wow.

Anything now.

Do you have anything to add to the Mr. microphone mythos?

I I was obsessed with it as a child.

Never had one.

Yeah.

I don't even know if I ever saw one in person.

I don't think I had by the way the actual legit Ronco, Mr.

microphone.

I believe I had my sister.

I believe got a Barbie version and I was like, Oh boy, one of these that I have coveted for so long.

So I could tell women everywhere that I was going to pick them up later.

So that you'll never know the powers of the real Mr.

microphone.

I don't know what radius it would broadcast to.

So much is probably miles.

Probably.

Yeah, I assume.

I mean, I'd love to wonder having never experienced it.

Yeah, that's true.

I want to look up those commercials because I have not I also have not seen them in 30 years.

You'd be shocked at how bad the original one is.

It is so shotly made.

There has to be a version from later on in the mid 80s that we watched.

I don't know.

There has to be.

I pray.

I pray there was.

This is my prayer.

All right.

Well, we did it.

We talked about it for another year.

There we go.

The tradition has been fulfilled.

Yep.

It's time to get to our countdown.

Lighten to the candle.

If you're if you're listening, this is of course our third episode of our best of countdown.

We've been counting down the top 15 comedy bang bang episodes of the year and we in our last episode, we cracked the top 10 on this episode.

We'll be hearing from episodes seven through four seven through four and additionally this year we have been counting down the top four live episodes of the year because we went on this multi country tour to the Canada as Lisa says and Australia and the UK and of course the US we did.

Of course the US.

Don't forget the Motor City.

Hey, what about New Orleans?

All we need is me.

We love it.

Look at that bum over there.

He's down on his knees.

We went to we did 40 dates this year.

So we did so many of those that we decided to count down the top four live episodes.

So we'll be hearing our number two live episode this time.

So that's exciting.

Are you ready to get into the countdown?

Yeah.

Okay, let's hear.

This is episode number seven.

Number seven.

All right.

This is episode number seven and we've been talking over the past couple of episodes here that the early episodes don't get a lot of love.

We do the countdown from Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving.

And it's understandable.

And it's the way of life.

People like the more recent things that they've heard because they're more fresh in their mind and they forget about how good the older episodes are.

You know what, Scott?

This makes me sick because people this disposable culture where it's like new, new, new, new now.

I don't know.

I want to know.

But violent crumble.

Instant gratification.

Make me come.

You know what I'm talking about.

I feel like that took a sharp turn.

But weirdly, this particular countdown, a lot of the early episodes are represented.

It's almost like people have been keeping track of those early episodes saying I got to remember to vote for them.

They took your admonishments to heart.

Now this is all you want out of entertainment is that the people that provide the entertainment is gold.

They scold you and it sticks.

So this is episode 390 from December 7th of last year.

Whoa.

That's right.

That is the earliest one, right?

This so far is the earliest episode.

To make it to the countdown.

To make it to the, I mean, that's right after Thanksgiving, which was the countdown.

And I do have to say this is the earliest episode.

So, um, all right.

So November 30th fans.

Sorry.

Sorry, Gilly.

This is an episode called the Oh, hello show.

Now, what's this one all about?

What do you think of my view about?

Um, probably Jason Manzukas of the usual truss.

It's not Jason.

It is our good friend, Eugene Merman from New York.

Oh, sure.

Eugene Merman, every once in a while, he'll come out maybe once a year and he'll do an episode with us and he came out this year in December and did one episode with us.

Eugene, it's fun and he's funny.

I like being around him.

I like it.

I like everything about it.

I like you.

I like you a lot.

I love you.

So, it's Eugene Merman and it's also Nick Croll and John Mulaney.

Oh, hello.

At the time they were just about, at the time of the recording, I believe they were just about to go out to New York to do the Oh, hello show off Broadway.

Yeah.

And everyone told them, don't do that.

Don't do that.

That'll never amount to anything.

What do you talk about?

Yeah.

And instead it amounted to everything because they are currently in the middle of a sold out Broadway run, which is acclaimed and has been extended.

And here's me.

Croll, what's the spenders?

Is your name, JCPenney?

Sure it is.

Do you know that old joke?

No.

Guy or a kid, probably.

I don't know.

I heard it when I was a kid.

So maybe I'm imagining it was a guy or a kid walking down the street, see someone with a great shirt on says, where did you get that shirt?

And the person says, Oh, JCPenney.

And then walks down the street, sees a guy with a great pair of pants goes, Oh, I love those pants.

Where'd you get him?

He goes, JCPenney walking down the street, sees a guy with a pair of shoes.

Hey, where'd you get those shoes?

JCPenney sees a guy walking down the street.

He's got a barrel with suspenders.

What's going on with you?

He goes, my name's JCPenney.

People have stolen his clothes.

People have stolen his clothes, you see.

One I had a time.

I submitted that.

They remained in the area.

Would it surprise you, Paul, to learn that I submitted that joke to readers digest laughter is the best medicine as a child.

You know what I'm talking about.

I know exactly what you're talking about.

And I remember doing shit like that when I was a kid and how important it was.

Yes.

And I would scour rules digest every year.

To see your name in print.

Oh my God.

How amazing with that.

And now our names are in prints in magazine and we throw them away.

Oh, God, another fucking magazine.

It just trusts me.

I need more room in my apartment for cat skeletons.

So laughter is the best medicine humor and uniform.

That's right.

I can't remember what the other ones were.

There was a, yeah, there were a number of them.

There were some.

And that was all I would read readers digest for would be those five pages of jokes that they would have.

Anyway.

I was like, what was it like abortion doctor?

Abortion doctor.

That was not a section of writers digest.

It was jokes that were overheard at an abortion doctor.

Oh no, no, they were medical jokes.

They were medical jokes.

They weren't about abortions.

But they were overheard at abortion clinics.

It was very specifically overheard at an abortion clinic.

Okay, I don't know that you're remembering this right.

I remember they were funny jokes.

But all right, let's listen to this.

This was Nick Croll and John Mulaney, of course, playing their characters, George and Gil.

Very popular now, they're on Broadway and which is no surprise that they've been well represented on the countdown here.

And we're going to hear a little bit of Gill and George talking about what they've been up to back last December.

This is your episode seven.

Number seven.

When we walk in a room, no matter what we think it is, you go.

You say yes.

Sit down.

What are some of the situations you've walked into rooms?

It's not been what you expected.

Oh boy.

Well, we thought we were on Wheel of Fortune once.

What it turned out to be.

We it was the support group.

For parents who had lost kids.

Drug and alcohol.

We thought it was the taping of Wheel of Fortune.

Okay.

And how long did you think it was still a taping Wheel of Fortune?

The half hour Wheel of Fortune to half hour.

So when it hit 31 minutes and you said, wait a minute, this can't be Wheel of Fortune.

No, this poor woman who is just bereft is not, she hasn't touched a single thing and turned over a letter.

I turned the deal famously and I said, I don't think that's Vanuite at all.

That was famous.

Yes.

But we've had our run on TV as well.

We had a game show that was stupid.

What game you had a game show?

You know what?

No, I don't know.

Oh, that's what it was called.

You know what?

So Gil was the host and contestants would come on.

This is back when you could smoke on TV.

Oh, for great era.

They would try to guess what I knew.

Okay.

Yeah.

And so I'm the host.

I go, oh, hello, I'm Jim Schrucker, Faisan.

And welcome to You Know What?

And the contest today is SkySawceman.

Oh, I'm the contestant.

Oh, great.

Okay, great.

I get to play.

You went through the whole vetting process.

I did.

Yeah.

I guess I was on a free production meeting with a producer.

Oh, you waited online on Fifex for an hour.

And I'm in costume too.

You're wearing a cow costume?

Yeah.

And that's even part of this I've found out.

Don't find out when you're the loser that wanted to be on You Know What.

Oh, the chat.

Sorry.

So here we go.

Hello.

All right.

Thank you for having me.

SkySawce.

Yeah.

Gil, thank you so much for having me.

Oh, such much way to hail from.

I am from California.

California, New Mexico, ready?

All right.

Okay.

At first, so SkySawce, you're a big guest.

And so guess what George here is thinking.

Sky, yes.

I know something.

Do you know what it is?

You know what?

Gil, can I ask one question about the game?

Absolutely.

Am I just supposed to guess anything he knows or what he's thinking right now?

That's the game.

If you win and if you win, you will get a 1982 Chrysler New Yorker.

And 82.

When was this game show on?

1981.

Wow.

So it was a future.

Next year's model, baby.

Okay, great.

I mean, we were playing with Koch money at that point.

Okay.

So I'm supposed to guess something you know.

I know something, Scott.

But do you know what?

Two plus two equals four.

That's not it.

You lose.

Thanks for playing.

That's the game.

Wait, so you don't?

That's the whole thing.

You don't know that fact or that's not the fact.

I'm still confused on the rules of the game.

You say I'm a fucking idiot.

I don't know two plus two equals four.

I know that.

Okay.

So that is in the realm of things.

It's not what he's thinking.

Okay.

That's not what he knows.

Okay.

So you're thinking of a thing.

Can I play again?

Of course.

Okay.

We will play for a long time.

And with the same player each time.

Yeah.

All right.

This is why the show has canceled almost immediately.

When you say almost how long did it take?

During a run through.

Okay.

We were getting it on its feet and the head of the network back then.

Si.

Fartman.

Si.

Fartman.

With two noises in his name.

Yeah.

That's how you knew he liked it.

That was if he liked it.

That was a compliment.

He was not like it.

We didn't.

He light up four cigarettes and then throw them at you.

Okay.

So this is not for a classic network.

Okay.

And this is for at the time like a high school TV TV station.

Oh, were you guys in?

No.

This is way after you guys were out of high school.

You, George, at that point you were still at Sunnionka.

No, I was a shoot story professor at Sunnionka's Gozibras for five years and then I left because of some stuff, you know, but that's all in sealed documents.

So that doesn't matter.

Sex for great.

But that's the set.

Yeah, but that's the set.

You're the limitations on that.

Well, but that's over now.

Yeah, that's not a problem anymore.

And but at that point I was teaching performing arts at, do you know the school fame?

Yeah, I do.

Yeah.

I've taught a school called anonymous.

Okay.

So the exact opposite.

Yes.

It was for people with no shot.

Ugly kids.

Ugly, untalentos.

Okay.

What were the productions like?

I can only imagine.

We did no Oklahoma.

No, Oklahoma.

It was opposite production.

Yeah.

Okay.

What about Jesus Christ superstar?

Do we ever do a production that was a lot like that one?

We did a similar one, but it was called Moses.

Struggling acting.

Okay.

What about the fan of the opera?

Was it?

I can't imagine there would have been.

We did the good looking guy that's allowed to be at the opera.

So the opera part was not opposite.

That's interesting.

No, because the opposite of a phantom of an opera is a guy that's allowed to be at an opera.

Oh, you're thinking you're thinking stupidly that it would be the ghost of the ballet, but you don't get opposites and you don't get basic things.

And then guys and those we did chicks and teddy bears.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, that was a porno.

That was a straight line.

I'm interested in that one.

I would have liked to.

And instead of a laser, instead of a laser, instead of a laser, instead of a laser, instead of a laser, we did Los Homies.

And there was three Homies having the best day of their fucking lives.

We're in high black socks and a shirt button to the top.

And real long shorts and flippies flip flops.

The name of the musical will tell you what the opposite is.

But you're going to get your gun.

Oh, Bernie gets your gun.

Bernie gets.

About Bernie gets the subway.

Oh, okay.

They talk to the dog?

Yeah.

No, that's.

Oh, sorry.

That's son of Sam.

I'll get them very mixed up.

Well, you're not right and you're not educated.

But it's not a thing to choose.

It seems like very textbook diggin' me.

I'm assuming your parents didn't have a lot of money or something.

It's not a big issue.

They work hard.

I don't know.

They didn't live in New York for a long time.

It's not very important.

And of course that's your fault.

That's your fault.

We were lucky enough to be not lucky.

We were correctly born in New York.

And in New York at a time when guys like us in the 70s, when the son of Sam was doing his thing, you know, and he was a buddy.

He was a friend.

He was a dear friend.

You guys knew you had been buried with his dear friend.

You're a good friend.

Yeah, we were better friends with his dog.

People don't know the dog is David said that the dog told him to do the murders.

Right.

And what gets lost is that the dog could talk.

Oh, that was real.

Everyone thought he was hallucinating.

No, he couldn't talk.

But the dog was a pacifist.

Yeah, the dog was like a Quaker kind of really into like peaceful violence.

Spiritual guy.

So the weird part of the story is that...

Yeah, to throw the dog under the bus, frankly, it was kind of lousy.

And I said that to David the last time we visited him.

When how would you visit him in jail?

Yeah, go to him in jail and he wants like candy bars.

And then he would give us some sort of arts crafts.

You know, we'd get like, oh great.

Oh, another thing you made with toilet paper rolls.

Oh, thanks for cozy for my tea.

Yeah.

You're a nobody and you're not famous anymore is what we would say.

But he's more famous now that he's in jail, is he?

That's a big movie about him.

That's true.

I just want to keep saying musicals.

Little Shop of Wars.

The department store of dreams.

And that was...

That was the musical we did about Bloomingdale's.

Yeah.

Bloomingdale's.

You know how to blow my nails.

Blue your net meaning paint.

Blue.

Exactly.

We put blue paint on our nails and then we would go to the yagat.

You go down to the casting.

You go to the 40 carat.

And get yagat.

And you know...

Yeah, I do know.

And then look at clothes from Peri Ellison.

How do you stay around?

How are you still a thing?

Vin Houston.

Who are your shirts for?

No, miss.

I don't want to buy this not a concert.

I want to know about the whole operation.

My question is where the clothes go if they don't get sold?

Hmm.

I guess these people who run the store can get them or they go into the remainder bin.

They just that all those people get all the clothes that are stored.

They probably go back and they burn them.

That's funny.

Burned clothes.

We did the bombing.

We did.

The bombing?

What did you do?

Are we allowed to talk about this now?

Yeah, I think so.

Enough time spares.

We were political subversives.

Me and Gil and our friend Bernard back in Vermont.

You know, well, I guess everybody knows him now as Bernie Sanders.

Oh, wait.

He's going by Bernie now?

Yeah, he's going by Bernie.

You haven't kept up with Bernie Sanders?

He's in the new.

He's running for president.

Fucking Bernard is running for president of what?

The dandruff on Blazer Society?

No.

You're kidding me.

No, you're so Bernard.

You're president.

Bernie goes by Bernie to sound young.

So Bernie says...

Wait a minute.

He's run...

Wait a minute.

Bernard.

Our equal.

Yeah.

In all sorts of ways.

Oh, wait.

We were in the Burlington three.

Right.

We were part of the Burlington three and we bombed the Burlington code factory.

The original.

And they bounced back in a huge way.

Well, they started that guarantee.

Yeah.

The people are going to like the way they look.

That's Minsway House.

That's Minsway House, which we also bombed.

But that's because I thought that the guy that owned it was Judge Zimmerman from the Trayvon Martin case, really was a guy named George Zimme something else.

The point of it is Zimme Minszimzimzimzit's Jingleheimer Schmidt.

I blew up your store, sir.

And I'm sorry.

Oh, you are sorry.

Your apologies.

Oh, a monster.

I just don't want to get caught.

People don't realize the G.C.G.s got a lot of remorse in him.

So wait a second.

Let me get back to this.

We were three.

We were the Burlington three.

Burlington three.

I thought we might still be fugitives.

No.

And Bernie is running for president.

Bernie is running for president in the United States of America.

And he's got a great chance of beating it like a suede jacket.

Did he get some sort of amnesty or something?

Well, what's the deal with this?

Yeah.

I mean, I've been in hiding.

And he's not exactly been in hiding, but it was true.

No, you, you, because I would say you actually skirt a beautiful line between agoraphobia and ego maniacal rampages.

I won't leave the apartment for weeks, but I love to do panel and I really work on stories for it.

But you still, you're still wanted, aren't you?

Uh huh.

Yeah, I'm wanted in a couple different states.

Well, because I was the, I don't like to brag about it, but I was the founder and head of the Occupy Walgreens movement.

You're not talking about Occupy Wall Street?

No, no, I love Wall Street.

They keep this country moving.

Okay, I like this, my money to grow in the bank fucking store at Walgreens.

Oh, what's your beat?

I just am so sick of the 1% Scott.

The 1% of milk, 1% milk.

I want 2% or I want whole milk.

Usually they serve 2%.

I haven't seen a lot of.

At Walgreens?

At Walgreens.

Okay.

So, you know, 99% of people want to be able to just buy razor blades because of these fat cats that are behind plastic and I have to flag down a guy with dreads tied in a ponytail.

Well, now that I can just blow up Walgreens.

You can just press the button and it emits a high pitch sound and something comes over.

And then a dog, and then a dog rides over it and then a dog comes up and tries to shoot, bite your face off.

No, right?

You don't let dogs and Walgreens do that?

You're breaking down.

What is wrong with you?

He's, he's, come on.

He's still, come on.

I don't like being back in the franchise.

His pit balls everywhere.

They don't worry and you're not going to see any of the raccoons.

Yeah, you may see pit bull, although he tends to hang out in Miami.

He's like Miami with the raccoons.

There's a lot of raccoons here.

Yeah, you don't like raccoons?

Now these people take them inside and they start shim-pooing them and everything seems so cute and then they have those human-gloved hands and they grab your eyeball, pop it in your mouth like a garlic stuff.

They pop it in your mouth?

Yeah.

You make your ear on eyeball.

Oh no.

Yeah.

Well, then I'm going back to Vermont if we're allowed because I have fond memories with the health food store.

Oh, we had, we had a, we had a, we had a health food store.

We had a rival health food store with Robert Durst.

Oh, you knew Robert Durst too?

You know everybody's.

Bobbie Day?

Robert Durst, he's famous now.

Yeah, oh yeah, he's on the jinx.

Yeah, he, Andrew Jarecki and Robert Durst, you have a real psychotic megalomani.

And then there's Robert Durst.

Yeah, he was a good friend of ours, Bobby.

Day back in, in his Vermont days, we were up there too.

So he, yeah, so it's a funny story.

So, okay, so we knew Bob Durst, you know, our mothers jumped off the same roof.

So, okay, cut to the 70s.

Cut to from what?

From the jumping off the roof or?

The beginning of time.

Okay.

Any story I'm telling cut to the 70s.

Okay.

So we're getting time to begin.

To be in Jibis.

Look, a big bank.

The big bank.

All you need to know there is an earth.

Now cut to the 70s because that's where my anecdotes begin.

So we find out the little worm ass, Bobbie Durst.

Open a health food store.

So I say to Gilly, let's get in the rabbit.

Let's drive down there.

And let's open up our own health food store.

So we go.

And this is all just Tiger Milk bars at this point.

That's what health food store is.

And we, and we bought this real hard awful corn from this Indian reservation because these guys didn't know what money was.

We were giving them little drawings.

They didn't know currency.

So I figured if we really cheat these Indians from their reservation, we could get food so dirt cheap that we could drive pop their store out of fucking business.

So we start selling really rotten food to people.

But we're making a profit.

Yeah, these idiots don't know because that it's terrible.

Okay.

And because health food in general is terrible.

Yeah.

So it's such a new trend that they didn't know that we were selling old food and dirt.

Right.

So Robert Durst comes over.

I'll never forget.

He goes, you guys, you're driving me out of business, please.

This is the one thing in my life that calms me down.

I feel happy.

I can tell you with my wife.

I go back to New York.

I don't know what's going to happen.

Yeah.

And I go, well, well, maybe we'll, maybe we'll play fair or maybe you could suck a fuck because life's a game asshole and you can kill or be killed.

And I remember he looked at me and he said, I understand.

The next day he's loading up a tractor trailer.

The wife is crying.

Yeah.

They're going back to New York.

And we had a, and it was a laugh and it was such a fun time.

It was that the last time he saw him?

Oh, no, we saw him in New York a few times.

Or we said we saw him.

What do you mean by that?

Well, he's mad at him, he goes mad at him because he stole his thing.

What's his, what?

What was your thing?

I don't remember.

Well, burping?

Yes.

Skill burps when he's got there.

Oh, that's right.

Okay.

You know, everybody knows the guys Robert burps now, but that was me.

I was originally the burp guy.

If I'm, if I'm lying, I, I, he starts burping.

Yeah.

You don't want to be known as that guy.

Well, you take what, you know, you, you get your branding and you stick to it.

The brand is a brand, you know?

That's true.

Like, um, uh, is that your salmon on the comforter?

See, he's lying.

You didn't even lie.

You didn't even say yes or no.

I just burped.

The burping plies to lie, I think, right?

Okay.

Nope.

It doesn't, but it's not like he didn't burp if he didn't do it.

Right.

Like, uh, did you kill Nicole Brown Simpson?

No.

Okay.

See?

Okay.

Did you kill Ron Goldman?

See?

Hey, what were you doing?

Killing Ron Goldman and not.

I think the same person killed both of them.

No.

No, you don't understand anything about anything.

It was, or Enthal James.

Do you even understand what Brentwood was like in the 90s?

Yes!

And that's a lunar.

The Metzaluna scene.

Do you know how many rivalries were going on in Metzaluna?

I guess I don't know about Metzaluna.

I have the restaurant.

I refuse to believe anyone needs an explanation of Metzaluna, the restaurant where in Goldman number seven.

Oh boy!

Those guys.

They can go for hours.

And I'd like them to.

They can go.

What were you guys doing?

Nothing!

I'm happy for them.

Paul, I'm grabbing your arm.

Can I talk to you for what I was doing?

Can they go what?

I was going to say a mean thing and then I restrained myself.

Why would you say a mean thing?

Well, I mean they're, you know, they kept that Broadway run and I, you know, my play flopped.

What was your play again?

It was called Hamilton's.

Hamilton's.

Yes.

It was about, it was about Alexander Hamilton making the perfect salad.

The inventor of the Caesar salad himself.

Alexander Hamilton.

Alexander Hamilton's.

And this came out well after Hamilton.

Oh, so long after.

Like you had been an established hit.

Oh yeah, everyone knew it.

I'd never heard of it.

And I thought this is the book.

Time is right.

The, the time is right.

The time is right for having fun and a dad in the street.

Don't forget the motor city.

Did you see?

You've seen that video where they take the music out.

Oh, I love, I was just referencing it yesterday.

It's, it's tremendous.

It's so funny.

It's really my favorite viral video of all time.

So good.

Other than the Mr. Microphone.

All right.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we're actually going to hear our live entry.

After this, this will be number three in our live entry.

We will be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Shh.

Comedy bang bang bang back here.

Yeah.

You startled me.

I'm so sorry.

Have you been here this whole time?

Wait, you feel like you've been doing the show alone?

I mean, I'm not an imaginary person.

You're not an imaginary person.

Are you a person?

What if one of us was an imaginary person to the other?

How weird would that be?

And that when people were listening to these episodes, it was just me rambling for a long time and then taking long breaks for pauses.

I mean, imaginary guy?

In my scenario, but in the opposite scenario, what happened?

But wait, what if I am imaginary?

That's true.

I mean, you have all of the aspects of an imaginary person.

What does that mean?

You dress like an imaginary person.

That's what I thought.

You have a big beard.

I don't want to have this beard.

I know.

What do you have the beard for?

This for a bajillion.

Because last time, because the first couple seasons I had a fake beard, which added time to everyone's day.

And you weren't able to be an hour late.

That's right.

And so you wanted the luxury of blaming Obama for traffic.

That's right.

Thanks, Obama.

And so I thought, well, I'll just grow a beard.

It'll be easier.

And it is.

Does it hurt?

But it's so painful.

It's so painful because it's growing back into my face.

Oof.

Yeah.

That's no good.

Do you have to cut it every day in order to keep it the same length?

Or do you make the make every day?

Not every day.

No.

It's, I think I've trimmed it a couple times since I started growing in August.

But it's not uncomfortable.

I think I just don't like it.

Are you on the last day of shooting going to shave when they yell?

And that is a season wrap on Paul F. Tompkins.

I thought about shaving at the wrap party.

Oh, in front of everyone.

In front of everyone.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

That'll slow the party down for a good.

You don't think people love to see shit like that?

That's when somebody gets a haircut.

It's the best.

Wait, are you just hanging around barbershop?

That's when they're on these crowds around barbershop.

That's why they have clear windows too.

Yeah.

They know what they know inside their bread is buttered on.

People love watching other people's hair go away.

Go away.

It's not going away.

It's going on to the floor.

Oh, I never thought to look down.

Wait, you've never looked down on the floor?

I just saw it.

It just vanishes from your field of vision.

I just saw it went away.

Okay.

Wait a minute.

Can I ask you a question?

Do you think it just disappears as well?

Are you dropping money on the ground?

Have you ever dropped money?

Well, sometimes if I have too much money, I'm like, I gotta get rid of this.

I'll just send it to the away place.

And I just let go of it with my fingers.

Have you ever had a pet?

Yeah, sure.

What kind of pet have you had?

Birds.

Okay.

In cages, you know.

Yeah, and they're in your third.

Yeah, I've had all kinds of eyelid.

They're right.

I love them.

I remember having a cat that would appear and disappear periodically.

All right.

I could do this for hours.

And we have.

Come on.

We have a guitar.

All right.

We have a guitar.

Hold on.

There's more time for this.

Yeah.

Oh, here's a serious entreaty to the audience.

If someone could keep track of the sound effects we already have for the sound effects record.

Yes.

Yeah.

What are they?

I know we have water being poured into a glass many times.

Yes.

So we have another number of options to choose from when we finally put the album together of that track.

Right.

That's the only one I can remember right now.

Yeah, I know.

Well, there's, of course, the train and the Doppler effect.

Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

Okay.

We got that.

That's not the train.

That what do you mean that?

Are the train and the Doppler effect two separate sound effects?

Well, the, the Doppler, the train is experienced.

The sound of the train is experiencing the Doppler effect.

Yes.

One could not literally record the Doppler effect without recording the thing that is experiencing the Doppler effect.

Scott Scott, I understand that it was your phrasing of we have the train and the Doppler effect.

Which would made me think that you have in your mind have another two things.

There's a track called the Doppler effect.

This is just combined.

Okay.

This is my mistake.

There could be two tracks, one train and one passing train, which is that viral video.

Two tracks, one train.

Well, what was your entreaty, by the way?

It was please let us know what tracks we already have already have because we got to fill 99 tracks and we got to get to business on this.

Because I would eventually like to put out a sound effects record.

Much like, please don't joke about I-Robot this Christmas.

We need to get this out next year in the stores.

No, we're not going to get it out next year.

We're not going to get the sound effects record out next year.

I don't think we're going to get that.

Do you think that'll be the last episode that we have recorded?

Yes.

Will just be a sound effects record.

Will just be the sound effects record.

99 sound effects in a row.

Number one with a bullet.

I think we said number 11 was the glass.

Yeah.

Was the water in the glass.

Something like that.

Please let us know because we are struggling here.

Look, we got a lot of tracks to put down.

I can't even think of that many sounds.

How many sounds are there?

There's birds.

That's all I get to get.

Water in the glass.

The Doppler effect.

The end.

Princey's train.

I love that movie.

Look, we got to get to our next clip.

Yeah.

All right.

This is your number three.

Number three.

That's right.

This is number three of the live tracks.

This is an interesting one, Paul.

This is some of these picks for the live tracks are kind of atypical.

Look, we did a ton of episodes.

We did.

And...

Well, you're saying some people made like the voters chose poorly.

No, they didn't choose poorly.

What's interesting to me is we did so many episodes in a row in the US tour.

Yes.

Not a lot of those made it, but these little interesting ones, Montreal, for instance, with the Oh, hello guys.

Sydney, you know, out there in the middle of nowhere.

And then this one, this is the only one you weren't at, Paul.

This is live from Comic Con, July 25th.

Fuck this.

No, Paul, come back.

Come back.

Paul, come back.

Do it.

Come back.

You just want me to talk about it?

Yeah, you got it.

I'm sorry, Paul.

I'm sorry.

You decided to go to New York.

You were invited.

That's great.

You were invited.

Enjoy everybody.

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

This was live from Comic Con.

Every year I try to go down to Comic Con and do an episode down there.

Usually I'm down there for business and pleasure reasons.

And a lot of people are down there as well.

And this time we had a great group.

We have Lauren.

Sounds great.

We have Lauren Lapkis.

Jason Manzukas.

John Gabris, our good old intern, Geno.

And of course, Thomas Middleditch happened to be down there as well.

And this sort of acts as a de facto sequel to the Kid Detectives saga.

Thank God.

God.

Because Thomas and Lauren decided to do the Kid Detectives together.

The best.

If you're going to talk, talk on mine.

I didn't realize I was talking.

You realize you were sarcastically talking.

What?

Feel free to chime in.

Just do it on Mike.

You got it.

Now listeners will be interested to know that we had a couple of celebs in the audience watching this.

We had from the TV show Orphan Black.

We had Tatiana Maslini and we also had Christian Bruin.

They were in the audience.

They happened to be there for Orphan Black.

And when they heard the lineup, they said, we got to get over there.

And they came out and watched this episode.

So imagine that while you're listening to it.

I hope they had fun.

This is, you've picked it as the number two.

Did I say number three before?

Because it is number two.

This is...

Even better.

This is actually the number two episode of the live episodes.

This is live from Comic Con.

You're number two.

Number two.

JJ Murphy, it's so great to see you again.

Great to see you, sir.

It's a pleasure.

It's such a pleasure.

The pleasure is all ours.

The pleasure is ours.

Just before this, I was showing my sister how far I can take my dinger behind my legs.

It looks like a real pussy.

Yeah.

I was so excited.

I could tuck it all the way and touch the pain in my hole.

Wait, that's where we're starting?

If you go for the super deep tuck, it creates a little fold.

Good tip.

Which is nice.

Yeah, that's great advice.

Thanks, mister.

That'll come in handy later.

Cool.

Alright, so for those of you who don't know and haven't listened to their episodes, JJ and Murphy are a couple of kids who fancy themselves to be kid detectives.

Fancy ourselves.

More like our ourselves.

Yeah, and actually we got a hot new case.

Oh boy, he's the big one.

You have a new case, really.

Who's Mike do we need to switch out?

I don't know.

I think it's JJ's.

No.

I think you mean the other one.

What's wrong with it?

Hello?

Yes, you're bad.

Oh, let me check these.

I'm sorry.

This is my job.

I forgot to do this, but test.

Check.

One.

Gino.

One.

Gino, you're Mike.

One.

Gino.

It's not me.

Okay.

And sound speeds.

So JJ and Murphy, you have a brand new case.

Yes, sir.

Did you ever solve your first case?

Your first case was the case of your dead mother.

Yes, we figured out that you killed her, sir.

No.

You may have figured that out, but it was not the case.

We'll let the course decide.

Are you currently involved in a legal?

I have a trial in 2017, right?

Yes, matter.

So what is your new case?

Well, we've actually got a pretty fun thing.

Yeah, we've been hired by the FBI.

Wow.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The very one.

Yeah.

They really liked our work and they said, hey, we got a big case for you.

And it's big.

Oh, so big.

And then he showed us his daughter.

And it was big.

Wait, that's the case.

Wait, he said, we have a big case for you.

Look.

Yeah.

And we said, yup.

And then he talked it back in and then gave us the case files.

Are you sure this guy wasn't a female body inspector?

Yeah.

I got confused a couple of times.

Yeah.

I reported a terrorist to a guy selling t-shirts on the shore one time.

And he was like, I don't know what to do with this.

I'm like, well, don't wear an FBI tank top.

That's cool.

That's the reaction I was hoping for.

Can I ask what was in the case files?

Well, we weren't supposed to share it.

But what?

Is it classified?

Yeah.

But we kind of hit a snack.

So we're hoping you guys can help out.

Crack the case.

Okay.

And the Federal Bureau of Investigation is located where?

Florida.

Tennessee.

What was that?

It was Florida.

Washington Lane.

Florida.

Yeah.

Florida.

Yeah.

No, do it.

Do do do.

Now listen, sir.

You're so polite.

I've always loved that about you too.

Now listen, sir.

The case involved a pretty high ranking official in U.S.

government.

Ever heard of it?

Well, we're in the throes of an election now, so it's on a lot of people's minds.

Yes.

He's a senator.

The senator of Delaware.

His name's Professor Buttskin.

Wait, is that his name or is that his code name in the case?

Uh, Jason, you need to pay attention to politics.

Cause you've never heard of Professor Buttskin, Senator of Delaware?

He goes by Professor though?

Why would they...

Why would Professor...

He'd take President over Senator.

His first name is Professor.

Last name Buttskin.

Yeah, it's Senator Professor Buttskin.

Of Delaware.

Anyway, he lost his favorite jelly bean and we gotta track it down.

It was a cute little red one.

His fave.

Aaaaaaaahhh!

It's so sweet.

Like cherries.

Yeah, cause that's the flavor of it.

It was his favorite jelly bean.

Oh, yes, sir.

Out of how many jelly beans does he have?

The world.

Yeah.

What?

It is favorite in what world?

What do you mean the world?

The world of jelly beans?

That was his favorite one.

He's the Senator of Delaware, sir.

He knows a thing or two about jelly beans.

So he sent you guys to San Diego on the trail of a red jelly bean?

Well, he sent the FBI on the trail and the FBI outsourced to us kid detectives.

And we sniffed it out to San Diego.

Yeah.

Okay, so you were in Florida originally.

You bet.

Yeah.

And what brought the case here?

Well, you'll never believe it.

Try me.

I would love to believe it.

Well, first we followed our noses.

Yeah.

Yeah, we spent a good, well, 60 to 68 days with our nose on the ground.

Sniff in the grass and a dirt.

And then we 69.

On the 69th day.

On the 69th day we thought, hey, wait, you don't have the jelly bean, do you?

Me, your butt, let me see.

Yeah.

So I showed her my butt.

And then I made sure I sniffed her for ginor.

So I smelled it real good and I didn't smell cherry.

That's for sure.

So, oh, so after.

So, that had layers.

So after that.

That had real layers.

So after that body inspection, you were still no closer to finding the jelly bean.

But by the time we woke up, we were in San Diego.

Yeah, because we.

You guys are right.

I am having trouble believing this.

You woke up after the 69th day.

We fell asleep during.

It was so good.

Wait, those two things work against each other.

It was so comforting, sir.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, sir.

We have been doing that since we were little.

In the womb.

Yeah.

Ever since we had trouble sleeping, we always smelled each other's butts or vaginas.

Hmm?

So you fell asleep?

Oh, we fell asleep so hard we flew across the country.

Wait, meaning someone took you and flew you?

I guess.

All we know is that when we left the airport, a couple of men said, you're welcome.

Hmm?

No, come on.

What do these men look like?

Could you describe them or?

Oh, big eyes like aliens.

Yeah, bald.

Like aliens?

Yeah, paper white skin.

Like aliens.

Three fingers on each hand.

Like aliens.

It sounds like you guys were transported here via the greys.

Um, well, no.

You to the math.

What math?

I think the math is you guys smelled the ground for 68 days.

Then sniffed each other's taints.

And then aliens dropped you in San Diego.

But the only thing on your mind is finishing this mission to find a chair.

We gotta finish it.

Or we won't get paid.

Yeah.

How much do you guys get paid for a case like this?

Um, one jelly bean.

Not his favorite jelly bean.

Oh no.

No, no.

It's any old jelly bean.

That'll do, sir.

Then we eat it like a lady in the tramp.

How's that?

We each take an end and we chomp slowly while finger banging each other.

Okay.

You chomp slowly through a jelly bean?

Yeah.

I don't know that there's...

That's the part that tripped you up.

How many chomps can you get into a jelly bean?

I don't know.

It's a marshmallow.

That's a question for a cartoon owl.

I finger his butt hole on the fingers of my vagina.

What more do you need to know?

I don't know.

Anyway, we're hoping that you can help us find this jelly bean.

Okay, what are the clues?

What are the clues that you may have so far?

Okay, well it's pretty little.

It's jelly beaners.

So far we know.

It's little.

It's red.

This sounds like a job for the clues brothers.

Clues brothers 2000.

That's my feeling.

Little red.

How many words is that?

Four words.

Four Washington Lane.

What that can't be where it is.

That's where he is.

Who is?

The Senator.

The Senator of Delaware is in four Washington Lane, Florida.

Well he's been captured by the FBI until the jelly beaners rescue.

He's been captured.

I thought he assigned you this case.

I thought the FBI assigned you guys the case.

Yeah, no.

Wait, so are you guys reporting to the FBI or Professor Buttskin?

We're reporting to F to the FBI.

Ancient agent.

They have.

Ancient agent.

That's an agent.

They describe their agents by how old they are.

He's ancient.

He was dug up from King Tut's tomb.

Yeah.

Show he's King Tut.

No.

He's.

He's an ancient.

Ho Tipper.

Whatever.

This is like a who's buried in Grant's tomb.

Kind of situation.

Oh no sir.

Oh we need to find out.

Is where this jelly bean is or maybe we've been set up.

Oh no.

Maybe it's here in this room.

Who's got it?

Alright Dangers.

Raise your hand if you got our jelly bean.

Maybe you should look for clues.

Hmm.

How many people are in here?

Yeah.

How many boys?

I've got it.

But that would put an end to all of this.

If we found the jelly bean what could we do next?

Someone's about to give up their last thought.

Literally someone is holding a jelly bean.

Which is unsettling to say the least.

Bring it up here.

Oh, loose jelly bean.

Bring it up here.

You know that not just any red jelly bean is the red jelly bean.

This guy's wife was like don't bring the fucking jelly bean to the show.

He's never gonna ask for it.

Ok hang on.

Stay right here.

Turn around and face these people.

This is a skiddle.

Get out of here.

Hey.

No.

Boo.

Do you really think that it's all?

How dare you disrespect two incestual twins?

These are two children that sniff each other's privates and are on a serious mission.

And you're distracting them with a skiddle you asshole?

Jesus Christ.

These are kids.

These kids have hopes.

They hope to solve a case and get their fingers in each other's wet sticky holes.

This isn't some bullshit zodiac thing where you know everyone's just solving puzzles on the fucking cross words or whatever.

This is a real fucking case.

Wait, what's that Gina?

I don't know.

Number two.

Oh, so funny.

Paul, I'm sorry you weren't there.

Are you ready to talk again?

Sure.

I'm sorry.

You chose not to come.

Yeah.

What's wrong?

What's really wrong?

I never really liked it so much.

They liked it because it was funny.

You thought it was funny.

You were laughing harder than anyone while we were listening to it.

You were rolling.

I was looking at something on my phone.

What were you looking at?

Funny video.

Funny video of what?

The baby and a dog.

What are they doing?

They're having a great time together.

Snuggling.

It doesn't sound funny.

It sounds heartwarming.

It was funny and heartwarming.

Wait, you were laughing so hard.

That's how I laughed when my heart is warmed.

Hey, can I say you were also laughing anytime anyone said anything funny during the clip?

It's just synced up like Dark Side of the Moon and Pink Floyd.

I don't think so.

I think Pink Floyd.

Remember when Dark Side of the Moon and Pink Floyd synced up perfectly and made that record?

That was so popular.

Alright, we need to take a break.

We need to.

When we come back, we will have the number six episode of the year.

This is exciting.

We're getting all the way up.

This one, Paul, I think you're going to like a little bit more.

I hope so.

Alright, we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Oh, we are back.

And boy, we are really getting into it here.

Yeah, man.

We are.

We're going to crack the top five on this episode.

It's got a proud of us.

I'm proud of us too.

We could have given up how many times do we want to give up during this process?

How many times, by the way, and we've edited all of them out, but after every sentence, we've checked in and said, do you want to give up?

Yeah.

And the response always says, I do, but we shouldn't.

We shouldn't.

We need to keep going.

Yeah.

So let's keep doing that.

By the way, do you want to give up?

I do, but we shouldn't.

We should keep going.

Yeah.

Okay, so we're going to keep going.

Let's get to it.

This is your episode number six.

Number six.

Alright, this is episode number six.

And let me give you a date that it occurred.

This is September 19.

The Quervo Gold.

Let's see if you can guess what episode this is.

Okay, September, third week of September, what normally happens?

Do I remember?

The very third week of September.

What have we done the past couple of September?

Or what happens every year in September?

Think of Showbiz.

The Showbiz Awards.

This definitely the Showbiz Awards in the field of television.

The Emmy Awards.

That's right, the Emmy Awards.

Now, for the past couple of years, there's been a person nominated.

There's been a person nominated and everyone from the show comes up.

Let's shut up.

I know exactly what this is.

What are you, what are they?

This is going to be an episode with our friend Tatiana Mizlani, Christian Bruin, Mary Holland, and myself.

You nailed it.

This is episode 446 on September 19, Scrounging and Lounge.

It's Scrounging and Lounge.

That's right.

Now, both of those guys have, look, they film up in the Canada.

Look, they film up in the Canada.

You know, they're not down here all the time, although I do believe Christian is moving down here.

We should.

When the show wraps.

Yeah.

But they film up there in Canada, they're not here every week.

We should too.

You know what I mean?

Most of the show business here.

They listen to the show.

They do, yeah.

Tatiana.

Can we speak to you for one second?

Especially like they're probably going to listen because they, they're a little bit different.

They, their episode is now in the counter.

Tatiana, could you see us in your kitchen for a second?

Will you take this podcast into your kitchen?

Tatiana, hey, what are you doing?

What are you doing?

What are you talking about?

What are you, what's happening right now?

What's happening right now?

You're living in Toronto the rest of your life.

Come on.

It's great, but it's time that you gotta leave.

You gotta leave.

You're always writing to me complaining that you don't get CISO up there.

And making me send you all the episodes to take my wife from Bajillion.

Just move down here where you can get CISO.

It's CISO all the time down here.

I know CISO has been promising to be up there in Canada for at least one calendar year.

Listen, between you and me, they're lying.

They're lying.

They are liars.

CISO are the biggest liars in show business.

They lie all the time.

Oh, it's disgusting.

Tatiana.

We're disgusting.

Tatiana, you belong here.

You belong here.

You're one of us.

You've heard that song.

We love it.

Sentry Boulevard.

It's about Los Angeles.

We love it.

Did you not know that what's about LA?

It's about LA.

Do do do do do do do do do.

We love it.

Listen, we'd love it.

Oh, you know what I'm saying?

We'd love it.

Oh, you know what I'm saying?

We'd love it.

Go on.

Be an LA person.

Get high with us.

Come do it.

High with us every day.

Scott and I, all we do is get high.

And then we record this show.

We can't do the show without being high.

Listen, it's true.

A lot of people say we deny it, but we get high.

We get high before every show.

And we hope that you get high while you listen to it.

And before you listen.

This is what it could be like.

Listen, I know what you're thinking.

Oh, am I going to have to hang out with Christian all the time?

No.

It's a big sprawling city you'll never see again.

You'll never have to see him.

Look, the minute that Donnie and Allison wrap their final scene, you never have to lay eyes on that motherfucker ever again.

Yeah.

You don't have to go to the rap party because you'll be busy working on another thing.

Yeah, you'll be.

Look, they're not going to shift the rap party around your schedule.

You're just the lead of the show.

You just leave the show and you're like 18 characters.

You're like, check out the back of my ass, motherfucker.

And you're just out the door.

That's right.

And they have their little rap party.

They're like, oh, what are we going to do now?

All our careers are over.

All of our careers are over.

Meanwhile, Emmy winner over here, she gets to do whatever the fuck she wants.

You should be down here.

You should be with Emmy winners like myself.

Yeah.

And Emmy nominees like me.

He's sure.

So look, if you're listening and we can't.

We know you are.

Come on.

You have nothing better to do.

Do the right thing.

For yourself.

All right.

Let's talk to Christian too.

Hey, Christian Christian, do you mind not texting us so much?

Yeah.

Could you listen?

You have that.

What is it called?

The Hardwick Mysteries?

I just thought it would stick to that.

He put, yeah, you play Constable John Stable or whatever his name is.

Constable John Stable.

He's got a trumpet and he solves the trumpet.

He's got a trumpet, the fucking trumpet Christian.

Listen.

What's your problem?

How about this?

You could start, maybe stay in Canada.

You could just stay there.

Bring that Nike swoosh show up there.

I know you've got plans to come down here.

We have enough actors.

Maybe, like, you know, ease into it.

You don't want to jump into the deep end right away.

Yeah, put your toe into the water.

You know what I mean?

Okay.

Good talk.

Great.

All right.

We're going to hear this clip.

Now, what's interesting, I don't know if this is in the clip itself, but we, anytime we have someone who is nominated for an Emmy and they tape the episode right before the ceremony, we like to joke about like, oh, what are you going to say when you win?

And I'm not going to say that we didn't think Tatiana should win because I have always said that she should win that award because of just the sheer amount of acting she does.

And it's not done by tonnage, but it's, you know, I mean, she acts way more than any other nominee, male or female.

She literally does.

I mean, it's a singular feat.

It's a singular feat.

It's a really amazing thing that she did.

But the Emmys are not really ever fair or just.

So in my mind, I was thinking there's no way that, so we were sort of joking around.

Now you include your win in that.

Yeah, exactly.

No, there are a lot of people who would say it is definitely not just.

And by the way, wins.

But I, but so we were joking around about what her, what her speech would be when she won.

Well, even that we were joking about where her speech was because it was coming up the day after the awards.

Yeah, supposedly she would win.

Yeah, yeah.

And motherfucker, if she didn't win that award, I was on my feet cheering.

Also, there were not enough chairs at the party.

I was at.

So you were already on your feet.

I was already on my feet.

Yeah.

But I was cheering and a what a great moment.

And she deserved it.

And I think the only time we will have had an em, a person who just won an Emmy and is on the very next episode of Comedy Gaming because normally if you are nominated when you come out here, especially from another city, you're in the middle of a whirlwind press tour.

Yes.

And you, you have to do so much while you're here.

Yeah.

That the fact that those two guys make time to do the show.

Make it a priority.

And make it a priority is, is fantastic.

So let's listen to this.

And by the way, I also want to set up in this episode, Mary Holland has probably the best entrance of any comedy bang bang episode ever.

It destroyed me.

Like nothing has in a really long time.

She plays Janice Kramps.

We're going to hear that entrance.

So this is your episode number six.

Number six.

Good luck to you.

Have you ever broken anything else?

I've broken that foot four times.

Four times?

Yes.

Not swing dancing each time.

No.

Different times, different ways.

What were the other ways?

List the other ways you've broken it.

The first time I broke it was doing military stuff.

You have to be more specific.

Okay.

I was doing it.

It was obviously second.

It was at military school.

I was wearing combat boots that they fit me at the beginning of my first year when I was like a tiny little 13 year old boy.

By the end of the year, my feet had grown, but my boots obviously were the same size.

So I slowly broke my foot over the course of the year.

What the what?

Yeah.

So it was just slowly broke your foot.

Well, I don't know.

There was no moment where I was like, oh, I just broke my foot.

It like it was like it just like generally expanded.

It was started really hurting really bad.

And then we had an X right there like your foot's broken.

Yeah, I was basically Chinese foot binding at military school.

Okay.

That's number one.

But now you're the prettiest.

Second time was drunken swing dancing is Dionysus.

Okay, we've covered that.

Yeah.

Third time was on stage in the middle of a play.

I broke my foot on stage.

I broke my toe backstage.

Wow.

That's not as cool as ours.

He and I have a lot of comments.

I'm a girl, so it was different.

They don't allow women on stage.

I was doing costumes.

And the foot.

What were you on stage?

It was like this clown based show.

Okay, you are the worst.

I was playing the personification of CNN.

Oh, God.

You know, play based off of no logo by 90.

How did you ever get on a show as cool as Orphan Black?

You oh my God.

It was really political.

Stick to the Murdoch mysteries.

Oh my God.

I'm sweating.

I'm so embarrassed right now.

I was dressed like a giant microphone.

Oh, God.

That said CNN across it.

Oh, Jesus take the wheel.

And there was another character who was a Nike swoop and another one that was a giant.

Oh, no, a swoop.

Yeah, and another one that was a giant can of Coke.

It was based off of no logo by 90.

We called it, we called it faux logo.

Oh, I believe it's a swoosh, by the way, not a swoop.

Okay, it is a swoosh.

Good, what the hell?

Yeah, yeah.

And that was with my own figure.

That was your own theater company.

You were funding this.

Oh, God.

And you and you don't recall the fourth thing.

The fourth time I broke my foot.

I thought I had repaired my foot and they had given me orthotics and I had worn them properly and I had been so diligent.

And then like a year later, we went and ultra sounded it to see how it was and they're like, okay, your fourth metatarsis is healed, but your fifth is broken.

And I was like, what?

When does that happen?

And then I had a different broken bone in my foot.

I don't know what happened.

I think I've.

Why don't you keep like a safe around your foot or something?

Why are you even letting it out of the house?

I got to live, Scott.

That's true.

I've always said that about you.

You are alive.

I'm so embarrassed.

I'm sweating so much right now.

I'm right.

I'm sure the coffee doesn't help.

Let's get to our next guest and you guys are going to be really interested in this person.

And I know nothing about her.

It's almost like when someone comes on like this, it's like, wow, there's a wealth of information I don't know.

And I get to now just feed on that like a succubus and just get all of that information out and just like rub it all over my face.

All I have is her name.

That's enough for me.

Please welcome Janice Kramps.

Hello.

Hi, I'm pregnant.

Oh, congrats.

That's amazing.

Thank you.

Congrats.

Thank you.

How many?

I mean, I'm three months in.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

So this.

So you're pregnant.

Did you come here to announce it?

Yeah, I just wanted to talk about my experience being pregnant.

Oh, okay.

Just what that's like.

So you're a pregnant woman.

I'm a pregnant woman.

I'm three months pregnant and get this.

Get this.

Yeah.

Get this.

I'm getting it.

Mm hmm.

Your stomach gets bigger as the baby inside you.

Grows.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Can I ask you a question?

Yeah.

Is that because the baby is pushing it out or is it the stomach is growing at the same rate as the baby and it's so it's always so that the baby always has like breathing room.

You know what I mean?

I don't Scott.

That question is nonsense.

You're as the baby gets bigger, the stomach gets bigger.

So it pushes out almost like Christian's toe, his foot eventually broke.

If that were the case, wouldn't the baby's break like his foot?

You know, I feel like the stomach is growing and the baby is growing as well and they're growing at the same rate.

Here's the things I'm not.

I'm minding it right now.

Do you have a penis?

You're looking right at it.

Do you have a penis?

You're literally staring at it.

If you don't then what is that?

What is that?

You're flicking it with your finger right now.

What is it?

Why is it out of your pants right now?

Well, that's how I do the show.

I know, but it's creepy.

Do you?

Yes, I do.

Is this a penis?

Stop.

Is what I am flicking a penis or is it a pendulum?

Or is your penis a pendulum?

A pendulum as in like in a clock?

Yeah, the pin the pendulum is in the ground pose or story.

Okay, is it a pendulum?

No, it's a penis.

That's right.

What pointer are you making right now?

My point is you know what?

You just don't know what it's like when you're pregnant.

I mean, you don't understand how that works.

You don't understand what that feels like when you have life inside of you.

So what is it like?

So well, I'll start by saying that I knew the moment it happened.

I've heard that.

Yeah, you can really feel something attaches to your, to what you have inside.

What do you have?

For me, it's a treasure trove of eggs and goo and spit and...

Someone spitting in there?

All the way back there.

I mean, I look, spit comes from somewhere and I think it comes from your deep in your vagina.

Okay, okay.

But how do we spit then?

If I spit out my mouth, where's that spit coming from?

Yeah, it's a good point.

Have you ever been out of a vagina before?

Have you been birth from a vagina?

So we got it in our mouth.

I was from my mother's womb on Timely Rips.

Yes, that's how spit in.

Cezarian, what's up?

Well, they're still spit in the womb.

Okay.

Is that what that fluid is?

Yeah, spit.

Can I ask you a question, Janice?

Have you been to a doctor yet?

Not yet, no.

I'm doing a full on home birth.

But you know you're pre... like you need to go to a doctor to find out if you're pregnant or not.

You know, I know because my stomach's getting bigger.

And I knew when he came at me.

But usually at three months you're not really showing yet at that point.

Oh, well, I'm really showing.

I mean, I don't know.

Can I ask you a totally tangentially unrelated question?

Absolutely.

What's your diet been recently?

Only pasta, only sauce, and a couple of chocolate cases, meaning box of chocolates.

Oh, cases.

Okay.

Eating for two at this point.

You've talked about pasta now, like in a sexual way as well as your diet.

Do you think that there's a connection there in terms of a fetish or is that right?

Yeah.

That's a beautiful question.

Are you a linguine lover?

Sure, I love some linguine.

I mean, I guess, you know, I never thought of it as a sexual fetish.

But I suppose, yes, pasta goes in my mouth and in my pussy hole in more ways than one.

Wait, and how many ways?

More than one.

Two?

Wait, like in the pee hole and in the regular hole?

Look, I'm now, when did this become about my sex life?

You started.

Here's what I'm worried about.

Okay.

When did you start eating for two, the minute that he ejaculated?

Yeah, that night.

That night.

Because I knew I was like, I just got pregnant.

And to be clear, he did that inside you, right?

He did what?

The ejaculation.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

That was inside me.

That was inside your vagina or your mouth.

It was it?

Because he was soft like noodles.

So there's like kind of a...

It was inside the bedroom.

Inside the bedroom.

But what part of your body was it inside?

It was on.

Wait, did he just ejaculate into a sock inside the bedroom?

And that's what makes you say who's inside?

I mean, yes, there was a sock involved and maybe, you know, but I'm not sure.

I'm pregnant.

And that's the, you know, the thing about pregnancy is when you're eating for two and you have a baby growing in you, there's...

You start to notice emotional shifts.

So like immediately that night when Murray's through that sock away, I was like, well, I'm pregnant.

Well, here I am.

I'm pregnant full of a baby.

Let's eat.

Full of a couple babies.

Let's eat.

Let's like get this.

You think you have a couple of babies?

Yeah.

I've got triplets.

And with the sock after he threw it away, did you go and retrieve it?

Yeah, I got it up out of the trash can.

I just...

Where are you keeping tabs on the sock?

Because of the science, Scott, I'm interested in science.

I'm an actor.

I learn things.

I study.

What do you want to put it around?

Your broken foot?

Maybe it would give me some support.

Maybe it would give me some support, Scott, unlike you.

A big stiff, crusty sock.

Yeah.

It would bind to my foot.

Like a cast.

That's right.

I apologize for him.

Thank you.

No, I apologize.

You're apologizing.

Okay.

I'm apologizing for you.

I take back my thanks.

Well, it wasn't...

It was in reference to you, but it wasn't for you.

So...

I retrieved the sock.

Okay.

I put my hand in it and made a sock puppet.

Because that's the first thing you should do when you find a lone sock.

This one was full of semen.

Yeah.

So I put my hand in it and I talked like a little sock puppet.

It was almost like a puppet that swallowed.

Sure.

I don't know why you've run out of patience with me.

Sure.

Whatever.

And then I...

You know, there's something about...

Here's the thing.

All the women in my family are so fertile.

Like they always have been.

And I've always known that as soon as I'm around...

Sex.

Sperm.

Yeah.

Seaman.

Spit.

Sauce.

Yeah.

All the S's.

That there I am.

It's like osmosis.

You can get pregnant, ayosmosis.

So you've been pregnant before?

I've been pregnant before.

I'll be pregnant again.

Yeah.

So you have children.

Well, they never resulted in birds.

No.

But I did bring them to term.

Okay.

What does that mean?

What do you...

I don't know what that means.

It means...

What does it mean?

It means...

I guess in the past...

Okay.

Final cop to it.

In the past, my prior babies have been...

Have been just weight gain.

But I think this time is different.

I think...

Wait, so the previous babies, when you say you brought them to term, you ended up just losing weight.

After nine months, I lost some weight.

I joined a gym and lost some weight.

Okay.

So, you know, at the nine month mark, when I knew I wasn't going to have a baby, I said, oh, this is...

This is a problem at this point.

So...

This must be weight gain.

But you're feeling the feelings of pregnancy.

So your last name, Kramps.

Was that like you had a family member in like medieval England?

It was almost like their job was to have Kramps into birth babies.

Is that just like something that genetically your family goes through is having...

Maybe you're feeling your family cramps instead of being pregnant.

Oh, like phantom cramps?

Yeah, ghost cramps.

Oh, you said that so fast.

Well, Kramps is Maurice's family name.

And I'm married into the family.

Oh, right.

Okay.

But I will say that, you know...

Maurice is not related to you before marriage.

What was your maiden name?

Whoa.

Cramp.

Just one?

Cramp?

Just one.

Yeah, not plural.

Okay.

So there's two different families.

Wait, were you both cramp and then you married and became cramps?

That's exactly what happened.

Oh, God.

Oh, my God.

Okay.

Meet the cramps.

Oh, boy.

Right.

Summer blockbuster comedy.

Yeah.

Hit.

Yeah.

Well, I'm not sure.

In the box office, darling.

More like a horror film that won't end.

Anyway, okay.

But I know that I'm pregnant at this moment.

I know that this one is a baby.

Why don't we take a test?

This one is triplets.

Okay.

I'd be happy to take a test.

Okay, here we go.

I've got one in my pocket here.

Oh, you carry pregnancy tests for you?

Let me open the package.

Oh, my God.

This is just your standard P test.

Wait, this is what you've unwrapped a quiz.

Yeah.

This isn't a pregnancy test.

She can't just take a quiz.

No, it asks you, are you pregnant?

Yes.

Oh, that's circle Y or circle N.

This is useless.

Yes.

I'm circling Y.

Okay.

And there we go.

You're pregnant.

See, I told you Scott.

It's magic.

All right.

Okay.

I told you all.

I guess so.

Have you told your husband?

I haven't yet.

No.

Have you inquired about the old midsection?

He did say to me actually yesterday when I was having a nice cup of coffee in my living room.

This is the morning with a book of poetry.

This is the morning.

He did come into the kitchen and say...

Oh, tree right in the morning.

He said, why the fuck you getting so fat?

And I said Maurice.

I didn't answer.

Can I ask what ethnicity is he?

Caucasian.

Okay.

This is sounded like you're doing...

Oh, no, no, no.

No, no, no.

He's Caucasian.

Okay.

All right.

Do you feel a pressure to continue his line?

To continue...

He seems like a forceful man.

Yeah.

It's kind of...

Yeah.

It's both your line though also.

It's her line too.

Right.

But, you know, a man wants to find a fertile woman in order to continue his legacy.

Yeah.

He doesn't exist if he doesn't have someone to reflect that back upon him.

You know, it's interesting you bring that up because he did the other morning when I was having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.

This is a different morning?

This is a different morning.

I was writing a book of poetry.

Wait, can I ask you a different question?

Were you just reading your own book on this next day?

Yeah.

Yes.

I was rereading it just to make sure I was happy with the poetry.

Okay.

Um, he came in and he said, you better give me a mail air.

That's what he said to me.

Right.

So I knew that...

Yeah.

I think there is a pressure there.

Yeah, it sounds like it.

And I think, you know, but ultimately it comes down to as a woman, do you want babies?

As a woman.

That's what it comes down to?

Do you want babies?

Do you feel like you can will yourself to have babies?

Oh, yeah.

I just want them right.

Oh, yeah.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

Walt Disney.

I don't think that's the exact quote.

Yeah, it is.

He's got a quote.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

Walt Disney.

He said Walt Disney.

Very end of the quote.

Yeah.

To make sure that everyone attributed it.

I did.

He added most of his quotes with Walt Disney.

Yeah.

That's right.

Well, I mean, congratulations in six months on either your weight loss or a baby.

Well, no, this one's a baby.

Triplets.

Yeah, what are you gonna name them?

We did the test.

I'm gonna name them Christian.

Oh my God.

Tatiana.

Wow.

Thank you so much.

Great.

Is that after us?

No.

Oh, okay.

Oh, good Lord.

Sorry.

No, I just need you to go on this guy.

No, but no, but it was a bit strange because like those are our names.

I don't know if you've been paying attention, but oh, I haven't.

No, what are your names?

I'm Christian.

Hi, James.

I'm Scott.

I'm Tatiana.

I'm pregnant.

Okay.

Number six.

Oh, so good.

So right.

So just.

All right.

We're man.

I gotta tell you, we're only halfway through this episode.

Why?

That can't be true.

Let's let's take a break.

When we come back, we are going to hear number five and then number four in the countdown.

Very exciting.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang.

Yeah.

Power wheels.

Welcome back.

I'm Paul F.

Tomkins.

I feel like if someone was someone downloaded this, they fast forward to this point.

You say Paul F.

Tomkins here.

They they think you're like broadcast.

They would miss.

Yes.

They would miss understand.

I was saying Paul F.

Tomkins here and referring to me.

I'm located here, but I am not Paul F.

Tomkins certainly nor would I ever pretend to be.

Scott Ockerman here.

Look, there are certain situations where maybe I would pretend to be Paul F.

Tomkins.

Let's say you called me up and you were like, Scott, I can't get home and Janie is expecting me to make love to her.

Of course.

We would you mind?

We keep it very dark in the house.

Yes.

It's pitch black in there.

We just want it slipping into the side door.

Like a cave.

Yeah.

Slip it in the side door.

Go under the covers.

Yeah.

Do what you need to do.

Do what I need you to do.

And that would be the only one of the only reasons to pretend to be.

See, I feel like you get off on talking about this shit.

Yeah.

Well, at least I don't get off on doing it.

What?

Are you accused of me of liking having sex with my wife?

Yes.

You dirty pig.

Dirty pig.

Alright, let's get to.

Let's get to.

Let's crack the top five.

This is your number five.

Number five.

Okay.

This is.

Okay.

This is an episode from June 20th.

So who knows what's going on.

This is episode 429.

620.

An episode called Almost Mandatory.

And these are two people named Jason Manzukas been on the show many times.

And of course, Thomas Middleditch.

Now his third appearance on the countdown.

Great.

Now, what do you know?

Why do you upset his office buildings?

You know, it just seems like there was a time when people really enjoyed my work on the show and now it just seems like.

You've been on the countdown.

I don't know.

You've been on the countdown.

You literally this year, this year, the one we just played was you.

The historic rap.

Great.

That's number one.

Montreal.

Perfect.

Number two.

Love is thicker than water.

Number three.

Number four.

Great one.

Sydney.

Number five.

Well, the tour ones don't count because well, oh no, because I guess they did because there was one that I wanted to know and then I made it into the best.

Scrounging and lounging six.

You've been on the countdown six times so far.

Why not seven?

Well, maybe you will be.

Oh, you think?

I think you may be.

All right.

This is Almost Mandatory.

And this was a, yeah, Jason Manzukas and Thomas Middleditch.

And Middleditch, whom we all know from Silicon Valley.

He is the titular Silicon.

He is playing an improvising, a character named Edmund Carlisle, a British fellow.

And this is all improvised, obviously, and never been on the show before.

And this is just all off the top of the head.

Wait, what?

The character had never been on the show.

Never been on the show before, nor since.

And this is all just something new.

So for those of you who say, don't do so many sequels.

Do, you know, all the stuff that you've always done.

This is all brand new.

There you go.

So why don't you take this and choke on it?

Be actually.

Be at spin.

Choke on it, bitch.

Let all Jesse Pinkman for you.

Choke on it, bitch.

Listen.

Mr. White.

Choke on it, bitch.

I felt I had a better grasp on it.

Why was it I in the countdown more?

No, it was guy lost.

Yeah, we both.

It's very elusive.

Yeah.

They're Jesse Pinkman, very elusive.

Speaking of the elusive, Mr. Pinkman, let's hear him not be in this episode.

This is your number five.

Number five.

You're living a life that is so rich.

You've got the hobby shop.

You've got your amateur barris, your stuff going on.

You're here on a case.

And then you're also doing reenactments.

That must take up all of your time.

Do you do any reenactments of future events?

How would that be a reenactment?

That would not be an enactment.

Wouldn't that be a prophecy of some kind?

Now you're starting to think interestingly.

Have you ever thought about enacting prophetic scenes from future events?

I've never thought about it.

What about the book of revelations?

If you were to reenact something from the book of revelations, that's a prophecy.

I suppose that's true.

So it would actually not be a reenactment.

It's always a way to branch out.

I must admit, I don't have all that much more time to bring out more enactment.

Because these three things, the reenactments, these two.

And then there's my sex parties.

Oh, also sex parties.

Quite a lot.

Did you attend hosts?

I host the Grand Chancellor of the West Cocksburg.

Well named.

You have these in West Cocksburg?

Well named.

West Cocksburg.

Fuck parties.

Well so you guys leave nothing to the imagination.

You're the Grand Chancellor of the fuck parties.

And what do you like to have sex with?

Anything and everything really, really, really on.

And I do mean that.

Yes.

So this is, I'm assuming because you're having sex with anything, this is an atheist organization.

Quite.

It is godless and proud.

So what is, what in a typical sex party, what do you normally have sex with?

Boom, do you have sex with what do you have sex with?

I have a follow up question, but go ahead.

Well I, it's hard to say what's typical really because each time it's been something different.

Of course, the standard guy girl trans.

But then I've had sex with a guy girl trans.

Trans or trans?

Trans.

So that's a, that's a, which is which is it self-attrenched.

This is a GGT.

It's all of it.

And then of course I've had sex with a bowl of Jello.

Of course.

I've masturbated on a small patch of carpet.

Sure.

Um, that would be a terrible sex party.

How many, how many people are attending?

These are just four people.

No, there's a, there's a whole, it's a whole squad.

Is it like an eyes wide shut kind of situation or is it like a bunch of gross, a bunch of gross slobs on treadmills?

I'm sorry, fellows.

If you're not, if you're trying to get a list of names out of all.

No, no, no, no.

It won't happen.

No.

Well, that's okay.

We wouldn't know any of them anyway unless there's celebrities.

Well, describe one of these people you've had sex with.

All right.

Okay.

It's got short hair or he's quite tall, um, hosts a podcast.

He's got a light gray, wears a lot of light gray with polka dot shirts.

I'm looking down.

It's like Scott Archimin.

I went to England last year.

I certainly didn't participate.

Did you go to any sex parties?

I went to any sex parties.

No, I did go to one party and there.

In Coxburg?

In Coxburg.

But then there was a guy now that I think about there was a guy rubbing up against the carpet, but nothing else unusual happened.

Hmm.

You sure?

I don't think so.

I mean, uh, it's all right.

If you don't want to say, if you don't want to say, come on, man, you and I.

Is that how this connection was made?

Because I was wondering how Edmund found himself here.

Come on, Edmund.

No, we can just plow to my spot here.

And stick with the amateur and bad of a stiff.

Yeah, let's talk about the amateur person.

You may have to talk about how you want it.

I'm sorry.

Look, I thought it was a special time.

Well, I was, I was.

I think he's talking about it.

Oh, hey, hey, man.

Hey, sorry.

We didn't know you were here.

Oh, no, I just want to know what you guys were talking about.

I couldn't hear because you were whispering.

Oh, nothing.

He, he had a case of mistaken identity.

And I was saying, oh, that's odd that you would have a case of mistaken identity.

And we laughed.

Cry off.

We laughed about it.

Yeah, we have a good chuckle.

It was.

Ha ha ha.

It was like a bit like, oh, oh, oh, but we were doing those simultaneously.

If you couldn't hear it.

Yeah, so it was interesting.

Yeah.

Anyway, welcome to the show.

Let's come back to that amateur barrister stuff.

That's a wealthy mine.

Yes.

Wealthy vein.

A vein.

You know.

A gold of gold.

Yeah.

A veiny car.

This is like a bit look.

Do you like varicose veins on your, on your women?

I, you know, what?

In if thing, you know, like if a sturdy woman has some varicose veins, I think that's fine.

But I mean, like get her on the treadmill, work them off.

I'd like to, you know, sometimes I'll just fuck the varicose veins right off abroad, you know, just like bingo bango.

It's odd.

Just like back to the future.

They disappear.

Yep.

Just fades out like a pit like the picture in banks of future.

Uh huh.

Oh.

So what are you doing in America other than this case?

Oh, yeah.

Are you having anything fun?

Well, I'm going, going to the beach a lot here in Los Angeles getting some, some do you do any fuck party?

And while you're here in LA.

Oh, yes, naturally.

I've been to a few.

I went to an Alison chains.

Fuck.

Is this the band Alice in change or is this someone named Alison chain?

Yeah.

That's what I was going to ask.

Yes.

She's quite famous in England.

Is she in chalice and chains?

Yeah.

What's your last name?

Uh, C H A Y N Z Z.

Yeah.

Okay.

You are from England.

Yeah.

I was going to say I was sort of not really, yeah, not really buying it for a minute.

But then you said Z.

Well, she's a YouTuber.

Oh, she is.

Oh, I love the YouTube stars.

Oh, yeah.

Is that what you look at for fun?

Yes.

Who's your favorite?

Alison chain.

Alison chains, of course.

Who is that one who does dear fat people?

That's so funny.

Oh, it's crying.

I don't know what that is.

It's very funny.

I like Rodney positive.

I like teen, gentleman, Jenna Marbles.

What about Jenna Marbles?

By the way, these could all be real things and I would not know.

That's the world we're living in.

Yep.

Look, you can't know everything in the world.

Rodney positive?

Like that might be a real person.

I imagine it is.

I hope it is.

You must assume that it is.

But when you are here in LA, have you seen any sites?

Have you gone to any place interesting?

I went to the observatory.

Oh, yeah.

The Griffith Observatory.

Yes.

And I went there and I said, could I borrow the telescope for a minute?

Did they let you?

Yes.

Oh, OK.

And I pointed it down to downtown Los Angeles on one of the buildings.

The big giant telescope that they used to look up into Mars and all that?

You pointed that down into Los Angeles.

Yes.

Wow.

So this is interesting.

OK.

So this is part of your case?

I can't say.

Oh, interesting.

That's a smart move.

Does Spy on somebody to use a giant telescope from miles away?

So this is downtown.

This is somewhere in downtown.

Somewhere in downtown.

A little boy is getting scolded.

Spy whom?

By whom?

By an older woman.

An older woman.

She was wearing a...

This sounds like a don't stand so close to me.

The police.

Your teacher.

She was wearing a dress.

And she had a hair up.

OK.

And you're...

Are you an amateur lip reader as well?

I am.

You are.

So what was she saying?

She said, don't play with the water heater.

Oh, wow.

Just playing with the water heater.

Stop playing with the water heater.

What do you think that means?

Well, I did see that in the background there was a water heater.

OK.

It's probably...

OK.

Well, this is interesting.

Oh, wow.

So why...

How did she punish him?

Well, I just...

She wagged a finger and then he held his head down.

Not he didn't hold it down.

But his head was down in a shame stand.

And then she put...

They both put the coats on and they walked out.

So I think he just sort of had a talking too.

And then that was that.

And then they went out and had the day together.

Did you follow them out the building?

You can watch them.

The man at the observatory said, that's his time.

That's your time.

So they let anyone borrow that telescope?

Yeah, don't you know?

You just got to ask.

Ask.

You just...

You all said ask, but not ask.

It's true.

So how long was your time?

How long did you have it?

It ended up being about 30 seconds.

Oh, well.

First up, good 10 seconds was finding what I wanted to look for.

OK.

So 10 seconds looking for it, 30 seconds watching it.

They've got the big cranks and you've got to, you know, twirl.

Yeah, manually.

Manually crank them around.

Right, yeah.

So it took a bit for the telescope to get there.

Oh, it's 10 seconds, you said?

Do you want the play by play?

Yeah, I wouldn't mind it.

Well, you documented.

Yeah.

10 seconds to get the telescope around.

Yeah.

Hold on, I've got to eat my books.

OK, yeah.

Oh my God, there's a giant book.

Oh, wow, like it's a legend.

Have you written out everything you've ever done in your life?

A barrister must always document his actions.

It is part of the case.

Look at this.

Right, at 304 and 5 seconds, I had the control of the telescope.

OK.

And 304 and 17 seconds, I found the building I was looking for.

And then at 304, 49 seconds, I was told to give up the control of the telescope.

OK, OK.

32 seconds just watching it.

Yes.

305 and 1 second, I saw a small girl take a shit in the corner of the observatory.

Whoa!

Yes.

That's like another mystery.

I don't want to be on that case.

I'll tell you that.

If they hadn't taken that telescope away from you, you would have missed that.

Yes.

You would have maybe seen the effects of it, smelled the smell.

It's true.

But I didn't need to see all the poo.

Right.

Come out.

That is a giant book.

Do you ever want to do poo stuff and pee stuff at the fuck parties?

It's almost mandatory.

Oh, almost?

It's an unwritten rule.

Almost mandatory.

How does that work out?

Well, I don't...

No one's ever not done it.

Yes.

You haven't had to...

You're not going to make a rule.

You're not going to make anybody, but it's going to get done.

I haven't had to ask.

I've said I have one time and I have to come up to someone and say, I noticed you haven't been defecated or urinated anywhere.

Oh.

Would you like to maybe join in the fun?

Oh, so everybody else was doing it for sure.

Yes.

And it turns out it was a good thing I came up to him because he said, oh, I didn't know if now was the time.

I said, of course he is.

Oh, yeah.

But for everyone else, would it all...

It sounds like a very supportive environment.

Oh, it's very positive.

Can I ask you this?

I wanted to ask this earlier when we were having this conversation.

Does a reenactment ever lead to a period-specific fuck party?

It's mainly why we do it.

Okay.

I was going to say, this dinner party one doesn't sound that interesting.

There's no better way to get over the British Civil War than by fucking the people that you've been fighting all day.

Then having the round heads and the royalists go at it.

Fuck style.

This dinner party one with the little person playing the dog.

Does he get fucked a lot?

It's mainly why we changed from dog to smally to make it less weird for the people who weren't doing that.

You do have to.

Yeah, because you do have to.

I've noticed this book.

You've written down, I'm sort of flipping through it here, you've written down almost everything that's ever happened to you in your life to the second.

Yes, there's a lot there.

This is incredible.

I mean, you can basically look back on your entire life and see, you know, everything that's made you the person that you want.

It also begs the question, if you are constantly reporting the events of your life, are you living them?

I guess it asks that, but I think what's maybe more fun is actually like reading some of this stuff.

Go right ahead.

Yeah, go ahead.

Here we go.

Have a look.

All right, well, I mean, you know, there's a lot of phishing hominade on it.

And remember, all of the dates and times are going to be British.

Yes, exactly.

We have our own time system.

Well, I mean, it's exactly what everyone else's time system is.

It's just, we're about seven hours.

Seven hours ahead.

So I don't think I have to necessarily address that.

I have to adjust it in my head just mentally.

So, you know, I can just read what's on the paper here.

I don't have to adjust it seven hours.

So that we can relate to it.

Do we?

3pm will still be 3pm at the time, but just so everyone knows, I will have to say that it is actually more like 8am where we are.

Just make sure people know.

Okay.

All right.

Because before I was reading times from here in LA and people, that was a given.

All right.

Right.

Well, let me go back to the very beginning.

Let me go back to the first page.

I mean, you've...

Oh my God.

This is...

How old of a man are you, by the way?

I'm...

8...

Scene.

So...

Which is the way that British people say 18.

Right.

I am 18 years old.

Well, I do not see that coming.

Yeah.

I've put on a few years in my face.

I did not use...

I was going to say.

Conservatively look 37 years old.

Do you put fake grey in your beard, by the way?

No, it's just been a real...

You know, I may seem like a happy, go lucky guy.

You do.

It's just been a while to get here, you know?

Yeah.

Emotionally speaking.

Okay.

Well, let me...

You better not give out a hard life.

Well, I think, you know, Scott's going to be...

Yeah, let's...

Well, let me...

The first entry here is actually September 3, 1998.

Yes.

And we have 401PM and 20 seconds, which I guess would be 1001PM and 20 seconds for our time.

I really have to adjust this all the time.

Now we know.

Here in California.

Listen, now we know.

And make sure at home, wherever you are, you're adjusting Scott's information for the time something you're in.

From the time where you are.

So if you're in Chicago, we're actually talking more or less...

Boston or if you're in...

I don't know, Australia.

Iceland.

Sure, yeah.

You could be anywhere.

Do you think you have any listeners from Iceland?

I would imagine.

Yeah.

I mean...

I bet if you're from Iceland, right in on the forums and...

Just let us know.

If you're from Reykjavíz.

And let me know.

I've had a couple of good fuck parties in Reykjavíz.

Really?

Oh, yes.

And definitely for sure, if you're from Iceland and you're posting on the boards, include a post from whatever dumb band you're in.

Yeah, of course.

Because every single person in Iceland is in a band.

And there's a lot of strong men there.

Oh, really?

Ever since our strong men.

Every single person is...

Every single person in Iceland is in a band.

And there's a lot of strong men there.

Oh, really?

Ever since our strong men.

Every single person is in a band.

And he's a bit strong.

Didn't he win the strongest man in the world competition?

Many times.

And so now there's a big culture of these strong men who think just because I'm from Iceland, I can be a strong man too.

Were they the closest language in culture to real Vikings?

Oh, okay.

So it's a bit scary.

I went to an improv festival once and there was a team from Iceland.

Oh, no.

I know.

Total nerd.

You think this guy's a nerd, says the recreator.

I'm a...

Of...

Of the boys.

I'm a little bit of a good boy.

All right, let me read this.

Let me read it.

At least my little parties end in...

I mean, yeah, that's true.

Yeah.

I don't think any of your improv festivals are ending in everyone having sex.

When I say it...

Or anyone having sex.

That's not true.

But I will say the team from Iceland, like to me, appeared to be like a team of Vikings.

They were hard drinking, loud partying, just rowdy.

I really enjoyed them.

They were very funny.

And there was like 16 of them.

All right, let me read this.

September 3rd, 4.01 PM in 20 seconds.

I am born.

Yeah.

Just one sentence.

I am born.

Yeah.

Wow, that was your birthday.

Yeah, I came out very well ahead in terms of reading and writing.

Right, right.

Wow.

So you're...

Amazing.

You're going to turn 19...

A couple months.

In a couple months.

Yeah.

Okay.

Wow.

So did you write this the minute you got out there?

You just wrote...

Barrister at this young age is almost impossible.

Is that why you're an amateur?

Yes.

I'm studying for my Barrister's exam.

My exams.

So being an amateur barrister is on your way to be an barrister.

It is not like a consolation prize for not getting to be barrister.

Yes, there are ranks.

Yep.

There's neophytes, amateur, there's journeymen.

Is there a professional?

Do you ever get to go pro?

There's master and grandmaster.

Okay, wow.

There's no professional really.

Yeah.

It's paid even as an amateur.

Of course.

But it's just my ranking.

Okay, I see.

I get this, I think.

Let me flip through the book.

I wrote that with my embryonic fluid.

You did.

Oh, wow.

Guys, you can see it still looks...

Let me taste it here.

Oh, thank you.

That's a little salty.

That's very strange.

It's very strange.

What a strange...

Yeah, why would that be your...

I hope there's nothing else in the book that one could taste.

Oh, that's quite a lot.

Let me flip ahead to...

Let's look at one of the more recent ones.

Okay, this is all the way at the end of the book.

This is June 17th, 2016.

Oh, wow.

This is just a couple of days ago.

6.31 a.m., which...

Okay, what would that be?

Wait, you were...

Ostensibly you were here in California, though.

Yes.

Okay, so it's 6.31 a.m. here as well.

Should we adjust it for England, though?

Yep.

It just in case.

Okay.

Just for our listeners in the UK...

So that'd be 1.31, I would imagine.

Oh, thank you.

Okay.

11.

6 plus 7.

No, that's...

I believe it's 1.31, yeah.

I was never good at math.

You're a dumb shit.

He's 18 years old.

That's true.

When do you learn math?

Later.

19.

Yeah.

In England, you learn math at 37 years old.

Okay.

This appears to be an strange fluid.

It's all written in fluids.

Well, I mean, everything is, I think.

I mean, other than graphite, I guess, when it's a pencil.

Is that not just the fluid of the pencil?

Is that...

Is graphite not just pencil ejaculate?

I mean, if you handle it correctly, you know...

If you handle anything correctly, you can make it come.

It can be a gem.

I've always sat back.

Why have you been stroking my finger this entire interview, by the way?

You'll see.

Okay.

Well, we'll see.

This is written in like a dark fluid.

Yes.

And it just says, I am the God of death.

I have enacted everything that I hope to enact here in the States.

I have enacted my revenge.

They are dead.

They are all dead.

Oh, yeah.

I was talking...

That's...

Okay.

That's my...

That's written in my shades.

I'm referring to...

Did you...

Hold on.

I'm referring to this...

Again, salty.

I'm referring to the turds that I put out my buckholes.

So, they're all dead because I flushed them and they're gone.

You flushed them, but then what are you writing it in?

So before you flushed it, you took a little scoop.

It took a little scoop.

Now, do you put the little scoop on your finger or do you have some sort of writing implement that you use to scoop it out?

I normally do.

For the bathroom.

I didn't bring it with me.

Because I think that's disgusting.

Of course.

Just bringing a writing implement into the bathroom, would you?

I try not to do a lot of writing while I'm on the toilet.

Sure.

I finally got them out.

Finally, finally.

Finally.

How long did that do?

Those little turds were in there for about ten years.

What?

Ten years?

Yeah.

Did you age test them?

I just know that I...

You know when you have a couple rattling around in there.

You haven't had a movement about ten years.

Number five.

All right.

Number five.

How about it?

Character.

Number four.

Now he's on it.

Never will be again.

Who knows?

Maybe he will.

Who knows?

You know, 2017, maybe the year of Edmund Carlisle.

No.

All right.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we will crack the top four.

That's right.

Your episode number four, when we come back with comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang.

Paul of Tomkins is here.

I'm me.

Across from me.

I'm you.

Boy, this is exciting.

The number four episode of the year.

Are you excited?

Getting down there, man.

We should say this is number four.

Number four.

That's right.

Number four.

Coming up.

We're in the home stretch.

We literally are.

I mean, we'll really be in the home stretch on our next episode.

Is it stretch or stretch?

You thought it was home stretch?

I thought it was more in the home stretch.

Can I...

There's a band that sings We Are Family.

Who do you think they are?

Sliding the family's stage.

Sister.

A sister's stage.

Oh, sister's stage.

Damn, if you had known who sang that.

Would have been good.

I forgot.

Why did I think it was slide the family's stage?

The difference between Sly and the Family Stone and Sister Sledge is so razor thin.

You know what I mean?

Daylight wouldn't pass between them.

All right.

This is your episode number four.

This is from May 2.

And you know what happens at the end of April, beginning of May?

We go on tour.

We did.

Yeah.

But before we did, we recorded this episode.

This is the seventh anniversary episode.

Oh, my stars and garters.

Mm-hmm.

As Hank McCoy, the beast would say in comic books.

You were on this episode, so are you happy now?

Yeah.

That's all it takes, Scott.

Not really that hard to figure out.

Jason Manzukas, oh, he's been all over this.

Yeah, I don't like that.

Yeah, I don't like that at all.

Horatio Sands.

That's great.

Okay.

Neil Campbell.

This is his first appearance on the top 10.

It's funny, guys.

Should be on more.

And he's in number four.

And we have Mike Hanford.

Mm-hmm.

And Tim Balts.

Very funny.

And Drew Tarver, both of those guys from Bajillion.

Bajillion cast members.

Bajillion friends.

Very funny.

That's right.

Work friends.

And this is, of course, we have Mike Hanford's playing John Lennon.

Neil Campbell's playing the timekeeper.

You do your Tom Lennon on the phone impression.

And Horatio's playing Shelley Driftwood, who even knows how to describe it.

So what a more fist character.

But I enjoy him.

Absolutely.

Gives a lot of directions.

That's right.

This is one.

This is one thing.

There's one specific thing.

A lot of directions.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Let's hear it.

This is your number four.

Number four.

Did you like Elvis?

I loved him.

Yeah.

He taught me to dance.

Right.

Let's see a little.

Wow.

Not bad.

You just...

It was weird because Elvis was mostly known for his lower body dancing.

Yeah.

And all of that was upper body.

He's like a reverse river dance.

Yeah.

And I've...

Lower body.

Very still.

A lot of shoulders.

Yeah.

And I apologize for the shoes on my feet.

No, don't you.

It makes sense.

No, it makes sense.

You probably thought I was a cooke.

I did, honestly.

I thought for a moment that you might just be like a lunat who could wander it in here.

No, I'm not.

Shoes on his hands.

But now I see you just doing dance moves.

The only way I know how, really.

Is that why you're shoeless for that particular look with your white suit?

Yep.

For the dancing.

Right.

Because I was...

You know, walk across with my shoes.

My hand, they said, you can't do that when I'm suddenly not putting them on my feet.

Mmm.

Correct.

You know that Abbey Road cover?

You know where you're walking across the street?

Now, Paul's shoeless on that, right?

That's meant to indicate that he's dead.

Mmm.

It's one of the many symbols.

One of the many symbols.

Was Paul dead like he was dead that afternoon?

He was, and he came back to life just like you did.

Is that where you first learned that people could do that?

That's what I got the idea.

Mmm.

I said, if I ever die, which I'd have a thought I would.

Yeah.

I did.

You did, yeah.

John Hinckley saw to that, right?

Right click.

Yeah.

What do you think about that guy?

Everyone, I can't blame him for being a bad aim.

Wait, who was he, he was aiming for Yoko?

I think he was at a target practice.

That's what I always thought.

Outside your hotel?

No, no, no.

He was coming for you.

For me.

Yeah.

He was pretty proud of him.

I never met him.

You know what was really interesting is James Taylor on Howard's turn this year said that he saw Hinckley outside the Dakota like two days prior.

Really?

Like, and Hinckley said something to him or something like that.

It was like, he was like around.

What did he say?

Like, hey, I'm going to kill John Lennon.

Yeah, two days.

Two days.

Be here or be square.

Hey, if I was to kill, let's say someone wanted to shoot John Lennon.

What's a good time to be here?

And James Taylor was like, oh, probably at a clock, man.

Great James Taylor.

Oh, phone's right.

Oh, hello.

Hello.

Hey, is this Tom again?

Did you just do a James Taylor approach?

I started it did.

Yeah, hippie James Taylor.

Yeah, it's not good.

Okay, sorry.

Yeah, okay.

All right, are you rich?

I'm rich.

Ah, that's a way to get him off the phone.

Wow.

He loves to say it.

He does.

Still just waiting for little Garrett to make an appearance.

Hey, well, John.

Keep forgetting to ask.

John, I have a question.

Sure.

Do you watch TV at all?

When I can, you know, if it's at a hotel room, I'm saying it.

Okay, that's the only time because you don't have one on the RV.

No.

So are you in hotels a lot?

If the RV is broken down.

Sure.

I'll have to.

Well, usually what kind of comes to shit right before I go into the...

I'm trying to jump over the Grand Canyon.

The brakes usually go...

Hold on a second.

Don't you still live at the Dakota?

I thought you said you still lived at the Dakota.

I live at the Dakota.

You don't have a TV there?

No.

So the only way you see a TV is if the RV breaks down and you have to go to hotel.

You have to stay at some hotel.

I cross the country, you know, three times a month.

Sure.

Right.

Why is that just so you can jump the Grand Canyon?

Well, sometimes I'm coming out to see you.

Yeah, that's true.

Sometimes I'm just taking a drive that...

Yeah, you popped in the right podcaster album.

You drive all day.

Oh, you think podcast him?

Just this one.

The ones that I've...

Yeah.

Got it.

And are you ever visiting Ringo?

Is that why you do some of these trips?

He's always so busy and he can never do anything.

You know, what's Ringo doing?

Oh, I'm still still mad at him.

Yeah, he has your guitar.

That's...

Yes, he's got my guitar and I want it back because I want to make that country album.

The Whistling Pete album.

That's right.

I was hoping the fact that you're here you could debut some of the new Whistling Pete's songs.

Not gonna happen.

Okay, well, you mentioned that you write songs for people on the street.

Not gonna happen.

But I will say this.

Yeah.

I came up with an idea that I don't need the guitar if I do a rap.

Oh, well, hey, let's start the...

This is the freestyle.

Is it a freestyle or...?

I don't...

You know, I haven't thought of it yet.

Okay, here we go.

So then, yes.

The idea.

If you haven't thought of it yet, I would say...

Very definition of a freestyle.

Here we go.

Oh, you know, hey.

I'm John Lennon.

How do you do?

I just bought a brand new tennis shoe.

Uh-oh.

I've never liked tennis.

You know, what?

Find me.

All the caught.

Fly me.

How about you?

Don't help him.

No, I need help.

You know, rap is very foreign to me.

Oh.

Are you...

That was about two rhymes.

That's pretty good for your first time.

Yeah, that was pretty good.

Yeah.

I think that might be the first rap track where the rapper says rap is foreign to me.

Yeah, I don't like to admit most rap I haven't heard.

They're usually pretty boastful about how good they are.

Right.

You don't have many people being that modest and saying, I don't know what I'm doing.

But the wedding of Jenny Rappers really know what they're doing.

The honesty of it is really refreshing.

I think a lot of people will like that.

I think songs in general should start with that.

Yeah.

They'll just like...

Very foreign to me.

I don't know what I'm doing here, but I'm going to give it my best.

Unless you're a classical pianist.

I'm never so honest.

That's it.

Last time we saw you, you refuted time or you rejected time?

That's true indeed.

Renounced.

That's exactly what I wanted to say and yet didn't.

What's up with that?

Oh, well.

What's up with that?

Yeah.

I believe there was a fintillating interview question.

I believe there was a post credits tag where something happened as well.

Yes, yes.

And more shall be told in the future a wonderful time period.

But for now I'll just say that all is well in the world of time.

Oh, okay.

Interesting.

Good news.

So we'll this episode...

But darkness looms on the horizon!

Oh, wow.

That wasn't the case.

I didn't see that coming.

There's some Game of Thrones shit.

Wow.

So are you saying time is coming?

The time has come for time to come.

Oh, wait a minute.

It's time to come.

Yes.

Time for time to come.

Are you time?

Are you the coming time?

I'm merely an observer and participant.

Like watch you the watcher.

Yes.

Maxwell, can I ask?

From Ben's doin' her fear.

Speaking of Prince...

Except when he does in every coming Perky appearance.

Yes.

Speaking of Prince, by the way, what's your favorite band?

Boris Day?

When he went solo?

Yes.

That's ironic.

Oh, no.

Not what I went figured.

Oh.

What?

I can't help it.

He rocks.

Oh, he's doing a disco dance.

Undeniable.

Well, thank you so much for being part of the seven years.

Seven years is a wonderful amount of time.

It is indeed.

It is indeed farewell.

No, I don't know.

I can't believe it.

He's not in the place.

He's left his cloak around himself.

He's all the way here on the couch.

By the way, this is a different cloak.

What to describe this cloak?

Is this a celebratory cloak?

This cloak has a red stripe to represent a certain battle I've fought through recently.

With stripe from the gremlins?

Yes.

Stripe from the gremlins confronted me.

I'll turn back of a clock in town.

I said, these shall not stripe.

Oh, wow.

I thought so badly sued.

Did this take place after the events of gremlins to the new batch?

It's true indeed.

Yes, it took place in the modern era.

Oh, really?

About weeks ago?

About weeks ago.

So it's weeks or seven days, Scott.

Seven is the number of the day.

Wait.

You have a number of the day?

Seven is today's number of the day.

That's right.

Ding, ding, ding.

Seven.

You said the number of the day.

What happened?

Do we win?

Is our own prize?

What is it?

Seven hugs.

Oh, wow.

Wait.

Seven a piece or seven?

Seven a piece.

Seven that you're giving out.

Seven a piece.

Teach.

Okay.

It was taught me so much.

I could use you on my rap album.

Now it's an album.

Oh, my.

Oh, wow.

Wait.

The album.

I want to just say, John Lennon, far from me to credit says, but your rapping was terrible.

It was not.

Are you sure you should commit to an album?

It's not right.

But what I would do is write it down.

That was on the spot.

That's the hottest thing you can do in the rap game.

Do you think rappers rap on the spot a lot?

Well, I hope not because we're paying hard money.

Hard and money to put on the album.

Yeah, it's like working on it a little bit.

It's like going to an improv show.

Just write a funny show.

Right.

It's like those pop.

Yeah, it's like an improv podcast.

Just write a funny podcast.

Come on.

Hey, I would like to hear you rap though.

Don't make us suffer through your meandering with friends.

Meandering with friends.

That's good.

That's my favorite podcast.

I would like to hear you rap.

Do you want to rap?

Here we go.

Go ahead.

Let me try it.

He did no choice.

Should there be a very topic?

How about the topic of time?

Oh, I wouldn't have thought that.

Time.

It's on my side.

And so is my lovely bride.

Or at least I wish she would stand there.

But she's away.

She's not here.

Okay, she don't exist.

I wish she didn't.

And then I would miss her.

When she has gone away, I wouldn't cry like I do each day.

Time.

Time is when I'm alone.

Oh, no.

It's on break.

Staring at the bone.

He's doing his own hook.

He's like Drake.

Hives me in time alone.

Then I go look at the clock and I cheer right up.

I am happiest when I look at the bump.

I like clocks hours in minutes.

One through twelve.

Those are the numbers in it.

I like to count the clock from one, two, three, six, five and rock.

And roll is not this song.

This one's a rap and it's gone too long.

All right.

Wow.

That was fantastic.

It should have been brief.

You didn't even have to apologize for your rapping at the end.

I haven't yet.

But it probably should.

Or to be good.

All the innovations in rap.

What do you do pranks?

What are some of your pranks that you do?

I pissed in my best friend's mom's face when she came over for Thanksgiving.

Did she ask for it?

It was not funny until now.

What was the setup of that prank?

Now I just like tragedy plus time in the telling.

Yeah, I was like I'm going to piss in your mom's face.

And then he chased me up the stairs.

I knocked his teeth out with my elbow, knocked about four of his teeth out.

He fell back and I started pissed on his mother.

His brother and his dad tackled me and punched my face so bad that yeah, I looked like a sack of potatoes.

Are you the guests at his house?

It was Thanksgiving.

I was a functional for Thanksgiving because I don't have a wife or family.

That's shocking.

Was that during the portion where you were saying what you had been thankful for?

It would have been a great time to spring it.

That's a great prank.

Oh, you know what I was thankful for?

Oh, it's a piss in your mom's face.

I did.

I just pull out my fucking, my pastry dough just went to town on her face.

Pissed me down.

Your penis does resemble an un-risen pastry.

You know what it looks like?

It looks like a roll of grands.

A roll of grands, Pillsbury Grands.

The young peel that spiral.

Yeah.

It looks like a frozen croissant that has been like left out on the counter did defrost.

Okay.

That's too far.

Personal.

God, get you an itch, Jace.

Did you say itch?

Give you an itch.

I'm setting you an itch.

Oh, God damn leg.

My gosh.

You can't pull it.

Number four.

All right.

Number four.

A good number.

Oh, good number.

It's in the top five numbers.

Definitely my opinion.

Let's count them down.

Number five.

Five.

Number four.

Number three.

Two.

Number one.

Three.

We forgot number two.

We should be number one.

Even when you got confused.

We got confused during that bit.

A problem.

All right.

We need to wrap it up.

We talked about Mr. Microphone.

That was my one goal for this episode.

Peaked early.

What's going on with Steph Curry?

What's going on with the game that you're watching?

Anything happening?

It's not.

No, no, no.

What do you mean?

It's not happening anymore.

They called it off.

Dude, a rain?

Are they still making fun of his shoes?

They're still playing it, but I'm not trying to watch it.

Is that you?

Go ahead and watch it.

Do any of the look we've been here for the entire day.

I'm saying, I'm not even saying don't watch it, Cody.

I'm saying, don't turn it on in the middle.

Don't turn the sound on in the middle of a recording.

That's like, you know, first thing.

Check the sound level.

Like, is this going to make noise if I turn this on?

That's all.

It's like a Russian stream or something.

Oh, I'm saying no more.

Is Steph Curry playing in Russia right now?

No, they just...

Wait, do you think he's behind the DNC hacks?

Oh my God.

Steph Curry is our man?

Steph Curry is influencing our elections via Russia.

All right.

He's mad because everyone made fun of his shoes.

We got to end it there.

We'll be back on Thursday with our top three episodes and our number one live episode and perhaps something else?

Oh, perhaps.

Perhaps.

Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

Bonus!

That's right.

So we'll be back on Thursday.

We'll see you then.

Thanks.

Bye.

Here we go.
