♪♪♪ I'm a little blackbird looking for a bluebird.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

What?

Yeah.

Thank you to The Jake Boss.

Is that a play on anything?

I don't know.

I like it though.

I mean, it's evocative.

Oh, it's evocative, all right.

By the way, you didn't say it.

I said The Jake Boss and you just sat there.

Yeah.

What am I supposed to do?

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Best of 2019 Part 3!

Listen, I want to apologize to The Jake Boss.

I feel like I'm giving him a hard time all over the place.

You're giving The Jake.

The him or her.

Or her.

The boss could be a woman.

This is not Jake.

This is Jake's boss.

The Jake Boss.

Yeah.

Jake's only boss.

But the only Jake?

Do you think it's Jake from Jake and the Fat Man?

Do you think it's the Fat Man is Jake's boss?

Do you think it's Jake from less than Jake?

Oh, of course.

Was that the same Jake?

It's gotta be, right?

It's gotta be.

So many Jake's.

Jake from the Fat Man is less than Jake?

Yes.

Wait a minute.

So his name is Jake and his nickname is Less Than.

Jake, quote, Less Than, unquote, Fat Man Friend.

So he's like, I mean, in a way he's more than the Fat Man because he gets his own name.

The Fat Man is just called the Fat Man.

By the way.

Well, the Fat Man, there's more of him because he's Fat.

Do you think that it originally was Jake and the Fat Man and they couldn't get the rights?

100%.

I think it was.

I think that they, and there's, I think a lot of the dialogue in the script was still Hey, Hey, Hey Fat Man.

We haven't.

Robin should we have to get out of this cave.

We hand into my car and then into someone's dreams.

The scarecrow.

Ah, welcome to comedy.

Big Bang.

We should all get together and sing that.

Now I feel like you're mocking my idea from before.

I like your idea from before.

Thank you.

I like you from before.

I like you now.

And in the future, let history be the judge.

No, I like you in the future.

I like you in the future.

But it was very long.

Future is my long time, my friend.

That's right.

And it is not written at this point.

Although some would say that everything has occurred already.

For some men, truly nothing is written.

Mm, art's for Arabia.

The immortal bard.

That's right.

Welcome to the show.

My name is Scott Ocarman and I'm the host of comedy bang bang.

And my name is Paul F. Tompkins.

I'm the guest of comedy bang bang.

That is right.

And together we are the incredible duo.

Is that what it was?

Yes.

And the dynamic something.

The dynamic buds.

No, please, please.

Dynamic buds of May.

I wouldn't mind that the dynamic buds of May.

That would be OK.

That's my third choice out of three.

No, all right.

By the way, still December, December 30th.

Can you believe it?

Can you believe we are just about to ring in 2020?

Did you ever think you would live to see the day 2020?

I remember when I was a kid, I was like, oh God, I hope I'm dead by 2020.

Yeah, me too.

I remember being eight years old in like 2020.

I hope I'm dead.

No, I used to, first of all, the year 2000 seemed like an eternity.

Yes.

When I was young, I was like, I'll be this age.

I mean, you know, I'll be three years old.

When we die, it will be those weird people that have, you know, the previous centuries knowledge.

We contain everything that anyone learned in the previous century.

It will die with us.

But like when you were a kid, if you would see a tombstone, that the beginning day was at 1800, you'd be like, what an ancient fuck.

What a piece of shit.

I would spit out it.

Really?

I wish this person was alive so I could kill them.

But we're going to be those people.

We're going to be those people.

Who are these people going to be?

Who are these people?

December 30th.

What is this month?

What?

Why 12 months?

Why can't the average average average is 18?

December 30th, this is part three.

Every year at this time of year, we look, I'm going to admit it.

We don't want to be recording episodes at the end of the year because no one's around.

You're admitting it.

So instead, let's put out best-ups.

There we go.

That was the original inspiration.

Was it the original inspiration?

Yeah.

Well, I mean, I believe in the first year that we did a best-of, it was we would bank it because normally we did the show live on the radio.

So the first year of the show, we did a Bill O'Reilly style.

We fucked it and did it live.

And it was impossible to get anyone into the studio in the winter months.

So we would record these after the previous weeks episodes or something and would put these out.

I think also people didn't want to go there.

Yeah.

What?

To that studio.

Oh, to that studio.

Oh, was it a pain to go?

I mean, it was a pain for me.

It wasn't convenient.

It's on Wilshire, which is not really where it is.

Then you would have to go up.

You get to the floor, you get to where the radio station was.

And then you'd have to make you wait for a long time.

And someone would come down and get you and then bring you up.

And then you'd have to wait in a different room and then you'd finally be brought in.

It was just a big pain in the ass.

Yes, it was.

Like all radio.

Yes.

But now we're in these wonderful studios and it's wonderful to be here.

And I probably could get people, but it's become such an incredible tradition here to be listening to.

What if they call us the incredible tradition?

Oh, these two guys, it's just such an incredible tradition.

Scott, I'm an Apollo champion.

It's the incredible tradition.

But it grew from one episode of a best of.

That was a good one.

And that one was like an hour and 15 minutes and then has grown into these four episodes which all are over two hours.

Oh, the diseased oak.

And people always said like more, more, more, how do you like it?

How do you like it?

So, you're a real glory of gainers.

So that's what we've done.

We've stretched these out and Paul and I tape these in a row and we're at the halfway point at this point and no end in sight for us.

Yeah, I can't imagine it's ever going to be over.

But this is number three and three of four.

And what we're doing on this episode is we are going to be hearing the and these are all episodes that have been voted on by the listeners, by the way.

We put out a poll after Thanksgiving.

After Thanksgiving.

Oh, God.

I'm just remembering.

I'm just dreaming down your face.

All those Native Americans.

Oh, God.

They made friends.

Such a beautiful holiday.

They made friends.

Is that really what happened though?

Doubtful.

Very doubtful.

I think that's what a story that was invented is sort of like the throwing shoes at the leprechauns.

You know what I do?

I throw shade at the leprechaun.

Stupid leprechauns.

That's the chief.

Wow is that a oh yeah yeah everyone votes on these and they vote for their top 10 favorite episodes and then the results come in and we have and then Paul hits the mic with a big glass bottle.

This is me trying to subtly ask for another bottle of water to the booth.

And this year we've been counting down the top 15 episodes of comedy bang bang and on this episode we will be hearing clips from the number eight, the number seven, the number six and the number five episodes.

Exciting.

So we're getting up there.

Do you remember the movie Anaconda?

No, I didn't want none.

With John.

Couldn't have been.

Yeah.

There were so many buns in the movie.

So many buns.

J-L-O-Z.

He's down.

He's right there.

He's down in the coffin.

There's of course John Voight was in the film.

Of course.

A recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom or Honor or something like that.

And at one point he says he's like the sort of river guide or whatever to show these people that want to see the Anaconda, the Anaconda.

And I can't remember what's happening before in the scene.

Two people are arguing.

But at one point John Voight says in his, this accent that he's doing for the movie.

Yeah, he does some sort of South American accent.

Something like that.

Yeah.

He goes, danger is exciting.

And that is, that is a non-musical earworm that is in my head.

Yes.

At all times.

I think about it.

It pops into my head a lot.

Yeah.

When people say something is exciting or people say something is dangerous.

Right.

It's exciting.

Dang it.

You know what I think of?

It's exciting.

You know what I think of?

I think of very similarly, I think of the time that I went to Disneyland with some work friends and this was when I was working with Rachel Quaintance, who whom you know, has been on the never not funny podcast a bit and was on the comedy bang bang TV show.

I was a waiter with her.

And was this Chinchin?

This was at Chinchin.

And a bunch of the waiters all like we love.

This is one of those waiter jobs where we all liked hanging out with each other.

And hang out with each other off hours.

And so we all went to Disneyland together.

And Rachel and I found ourselves upon the Jungle Cruise and the tour guide.

If you've never been on the Jungle Cruise, it's basically a pre-ordained route through the jungle.

But the tour guide can say whatever they want.

It's the only place in Disney where irony is allowed to exist.

Yes.

So you and my brother worked on it for a while.

And so you got a script, but you were encouraged to riff and be funny on it.

Occasionally you would go too far.

My brother told me the story of a co-worker who said once he was like, over there is a toucan.

And we all know that three toucans make a six pack.

And that was a beer reference was determined to fall.

That was too far.

Yes.

That was too far.

So the Disney Corporation either took him out of the Jungle Cruise or said you can't say that anymore or something like that.

Because either they fired him or they said, don't say that.

Yeah, I'm not sure.

The two extremes.

Where they killed him, I'm not sure.

But this particular tour guide on the Jungle Cruise that day had a vocal tick, which I think maybe knowingly was doing it.

Or it was a lot like when I would go.

For some weird reason I saw Moby, the singer, sing three times in one year because he was always doing festivals.

Oh, my God, that's yeah.

And so immediately when every song would end, he'd say, thank you, thank you, thank you.

And I was like, I don't know whether this is a thing that his brain is telling him he has to do.

The minute a song is over?

Or whether this is an ironic, like him sing.

Here's what I want to ask.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Before people were responding to the end of the song.

It was literally the song would end and over the, like you would normally wait until the applause died down a little bit.

It was just like, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

And he did every song.

And so this was a lot like this, but the tour guide on the Jungle Cruise would point out something and say, look at that over there.

There's a hippo.

Oh, no, the hippo's attacking us.

You go very exciting, very dangerous.

Very exciting, very dangerous.

Over here is a, well, we both have one.

Yeah, it's weird.

Around the words, danger and exciting.

But I think about it all the time.

And it's just like, over here is a totem pole.

And this is where the natives gather human heads and put them on a pole.

Very exciting, very dangerous.

I think about it all the time.

And I say it too.

Very exciting, very dangerous.

Wow.

Anytime you point something out.

All right, I feel less alone in the world.

So do I.

All right.

I'd like to be buried next to each other face down.

That's why they call us the dynamic buds of May.

So on this episode, we're going to be talking about these wonderful episodes.

And if you've never heard Comedy Bang Bang, I know I described this every part of the best ofs.

But for a lot of people, even the third part of four parts is the first time they've ever heard the show.

Comedy Bang Bang is a show where I'm the host, I'm the host Scott Augurban.

I'm not named Comedy Bang Bang.

I got confused for a second.

I'm the host Scott and I have entertainers on comedians, actors, musicians.

I'm the guest ball.

I'm one of the entertainers.

And I talked to these people for a bit and they are themselves.

And then I have comedians on who are playing characters.

They're playing fake people or they're doing impressions of real people.

And we never really break the reality of it.

We never say that, hey, we don't end every episode by saying, I'm John Gabers and I'm playing Intern Geno or anything like that.

Yeah, people don't like to do a curtain call like in the end of the bed seat.

Exactly.

So we do it here on the best ofs where we talk about the process a little bit.

We don't normally do.

This is not a typical episode of Comedy Bang.

It's atypical.

Yes.

And in fact, Paul is not on every episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

No, it's weird.

If this is your first time listening, you'll be very confused if you listen to a different episode and say, where's Paul, who are all these weirdos?

Exactly.

Another thing we do on the show is we play the snowman game where the snowman's going to be looking at us.

He's going to be looking at somebody.

All right.

So the snowman's singing.

Now he's turning.

Is he going to look at me?

No, he's looking in the corner to no one.

Now he's turning around again, Andes.

Oh, he got you.

It's close, but I think it's close enough.

He got it.

Okay, so I've been looked at.

I would.

That is perfect.

Now he's right on me.

Bang on.

Right down the barrel.

This is it.

Look at me.

Oh, still right over Paul shoulder.

Fuck.

That was great.

Maybe next episode.

It was.

Wasn't it?

The next episode.

Hold up.

That was great.

What I just did.

What?

So these clips that we're going to hear and from these episodes, by the way, it is an improvisational show.

We don't know what's going to happen on it.

Every episode, basically the comedians come in and say, Hey, I'm going to be playing this person.

Yes.

And we don't pre discuss what we're going to talk about.

We just find it in the moment.

Yes.

So the clips that you're going to hear are from the favorite episodes of the fans of this year, and they will have a lot of different people on them.

The only through line is myself.

So that is that's a good description of the show.

Yes.

I guess.

Yeah.

Do you take umbrage?

Well, I don't take umbrage.

I take exception.

Which exception do you take?

I take this one.

Okay.

Uh, did not talk about me enough for me.

Oh, okay.

Um, well, I think I think all of it in, in, it needs me for context.

Oh, okay.

So well, if you're listening to Paul F. Tomkins, hello, he's a comedian.

Yeah.

Um, uh, stand up comedian, although I would, you call yourself a former stand up comedian at this point.

Oh, hey.

When's the last time you did stand up?

It's been a while.

How long?

Yars.

Do you have not done stand up?

It's been a few years.

Yeah.

Wow.

Do you, do you think that if you started doing it again, if you got back up on stage, that you would still be good at it?

I mean, I hope so.

Uh, I hope so.

Do you think you ever will do it again?

Yeah, I think so.

You think you will win later now?

No, later later.

Later for sure.

Yeah.

And Paul, you were, uh, one of the best and you haven't done it in years.

One of the best.

What is this guy that you're doing?

I don't like it.

I want you to stop it right now.

That's the real me.

This is the real you.

Oh no.

Oh, that's all.

Thank you for putting out a character all these years.

I've known you because I don't like him.

Um, he's easier to do than the real me.

The real you is a chore.

Yeah.

That's the same for my radio voices.

It's a bit of a struggle.

Foul.

Struggle.

Tom Brokal.

Well, Paul is a comedian who has been on this show since the early years and, um, what's the first time you did the show as yourself?

I can't recall.

You called in from, you were living in New York doing best week ever and you would call in a few times.

I call in a few times.

I believe the first time I was myself.

One time I was the ghost of Michael Jackson who had just died.

Right.

That was episode five or six or something like that.

One time I was iced tea, I believe.

Yes.

And those the, uh, you, you start doing characters, sort of on this show.

Is that right?

Yeah.

That's true.

Um, just because.

Because I've been doing them on best week ever.

Right.

But that was for that show.

And then when you started this show, you invited me to do it and you said you could do whatever you want.

And you could do it yourself.

You could be a character.

And that was, that put the idea in my head that I could do.

Maybe I could do a character and you started doing cut characters and, uh, we're an immediate success at it.

And in fact, have been a staple of these best of episodes throughout the years.

Wouldn't it be strange if I invited you on here to co-host the best ofs with me and then none of your episodes and being well, I mean, that's what I think about every year.

Is that your stomach as you approach?

I'm not in my stomach.

I mean, come on.

Not a lump in your throat.

But much like when I knew the day would come when I, uh, would be stopped at the door of the UCB theater.

Yes.

That's the one who.

It happens to us all.

Yeah.

It didn't know who I was.

And I was like, oh, this is going to happen eventually.

And then it did.

Yeah.

And, uh, it was always bad as I thought it was going to be.

Thankfully, there was somebody else there that was like, no, no, he's okay.

Yeah, exactly.

But I still, much like how cool up stopped Sean Clements.

Oh, that story is amazing.

And you know what?

She was right.

She was a one of your right.

Um, but yeah, much like that.

There will come a day you think where none of your episodes make it into the top 10.

Well, that, that is not, uh, this experience this year, because already, uh, up to this point in episodes one and two, we have heard, uh, three of your episodes.

Not bad.

Not bad at all.

Perhaps you'll have some more still hanging in there.

Hey, it's a seat.

We, we definitely will see you're in my top eight.

Remember my space?

My space.

You're in my top five.

Chris Rock.

Damn.

Chris Rock.

Get a movie called top five.

I forgot about that.

Along with everybody else.

Yep.

Every single person in the world, um, including the participants there in Jerry Seinfeld.

The aforementioned Seinfeld that what was that movie?

He was a famous comedian.

Yeah, but he wasn't himself.

He was a famous comedian who was a alcoholic, I believe.

And he had that classic scene in a movie, a recovering alcoholic where he went into a liquor store and was tempted by all the liquor.

Sure.

It looks beautiful.

It's, I mean, there are nice bottles.

Liquor store.

I like liquor stores.

I do.

I like to look at the bottles.

I turned my own house into a liquor store.

That's strange.

I don't drink.

I just love the bottles.

But you do like to sell liquor.

Yes, I do.

Two minors.

Come on by, kids.

Hey, kids.

It looks like a house on the outside, but it is a liquor store on the inside.

And I will sell you boobs.

That'd be a great racket.

So Paul has been on the show and we've been doing these best jobs every year together for at least eight years or nine or maybe 10 or 11 or 12.

Maybe we've been doing this since the dawn of time.

It feels like that when we tape all of these best of episodes back back.

But this is on this episode, we're going to be hearing clips from number eight, number seven, number six and number five.

And let's just get right to it.

Let's get to your what you have chosen as your number eight.

Number eight.

All right.

Number eight.

I need to know.

Yeah.

What's this one about?

What's it about or what number is it?

Normally I say the number first.

That's part of what it's about.

Episode number.

This is episode number 600.

Mmm.

So close to the curious clump.

Very close.

But it's not summer because it was May six.

Yes.

Summer's just around the corner at that time.

Right around the corner.

And so this is obviously one of the big hundos.

Of course.

600.

And you have a little tradition, don't you?

Certainly do.

And let me talk about this very briefly.

So this year was the 10th anniversary of comedy bang bang.

And also it was coinciding with the 600th episode.

Yes.

And for here's the process of what exactly happened.

Okay, I'll tell you first what happened and I'll tell you why it happened.

Tell me whatever whatever you want.

I don't care.

Okay.

So episode 599 turned out to be our 10th anniversary episode.

And for that episode we put out a 10 exactly 10 hours on the dot to the second.

That's right.

Episode.

Weird.

And weird.

Why weird?

No reason.

Well here was here was my thought process behind it was I wanted to get I wanted to honor all of the people from the past the the old past the early days the middle years and the recent years.

I wanted them all to be on one episode and I didn't want to do just another when we do these end of the year holiday episodes and when we've done the anniversary episodes I put out a call basically to everyone's favorite guests and but they have to be all in the same room together at the same time and they have to be at a certain time.

And usually what happens is a great number of people are available then which is always good but then a great number of people are not available.

And this for the 10th anniversary I just really wanted to have people on that that just don't have schedules that can accommodate you know being there at a time when I can do it.

You know what I mean at a certain time.

So I wanted to have on the Seth Morris is who recently had a baby and doesn't have a lot of time doing Bob Duka.

I had a baby.

Oh my god.

Really?

This is wild.

I'm finding out on the podcast.

Wait you're you the father of the baby.

You are really playing up here.

I mean you're can you imagine I always knew Seth was very fertile and where were you nine months ago.

Sick.

That's why nobody saw me.

But everyone schedules I mean you know especially as we as the show moves on throughout you know now a decade the people who were there earlier in the in the years of it they have schedules now they just can't accommodate it and and each other's schedules.

So when I started trying to put it together I said okay maybe I'll do a couple of recording sessions with with these people and I put out a big email blast to people and everyone wanted to do it but everyone had totally different times that they were available.

And so I said okay well what if I did everyone separately and stitch it together and my initial concept was everyone was going to do five minutes and it was going to be like a two hour episode.

And then the minutes that people got here everyone started doing basically 25 minutes to a half an hour.

Five minutes is nothing it flies by.

Exactly.

So at a certain point I was talking to Taren Kilham who plays one of the Calvin's triplets and I was telling him like oh man I think this episode is going to be really long and he said well why not make it 10 hours because it's the 10th anniversary.

And I did the math and I looked at all the people who were going to be a part of it and they said yeah I think that would actually work out perfectly.

I had to edit it down a little bit to get it and you know the engineers by the way that was quite a feat of engineering for everyone to do it.

Like the Golden Gate Bridge?

Yeah exactly.

It was the Golden Gate Bridge of podcasting but we got it down.

Magneto destroyed it.

We got it down to 10 hours exactly and it was a lot of fun.

I did not want to make that episode eligible for the best ofs because I view it sort of as a best of.

It is a retrospective episode to me.

It's like a much in the storytelling of the West Wing.

It's an aberration.

Yes and it's a I mean it is a best of although everyone is doing new stuff.

They're doing favorite characters and I just didn't think it was fair to even put it into the polls to be voted upon.

So that is why you couldn't vote on that episode.

But then episode 600 originally was going to be the 10th anniversary episode and I was just lining it all up and I had done enough bonus episodes to where it was going to be.

But then I was reminded of the fact that on the hundreds usually I have Jason Manzukas and Andy Daly on them.

It just worked out that way I think on episode 200 where the two of them happened to do it and then we have tried to return to that tradition throughout the hundreds on 300, 400.

And so for 600 I was like oh yeah but Andy and Jason we've done one on the 600s.

So I decided to split those two episodes into two things.

So we did 599 was the 10th anniversary episode and 600 was the Jason Manzukas and Andy Daly episode.

Now after I decided that and 599 came out I realized that 10 hours is exactly 600 seconds and that would have been awesome to do number 600 and have it be 600 seconds exactly.

That would have been really good but I didn't realize it until after it came out.

So are you taping me right now by the way?

No.

Your phone is pointing at me.

No.

Either you're reading email or taping me.

I don't like either.

I was just looking at my phone.

I like it.

You like your phone?

Yeah it wasn't on or anything.

I was just like.

You like your phone.

I like it.

It wasn't on you were just looking at the shape.

Okay.

It was freezing.

See.

Yeah you're showing it because you turned it off already.

What?

I didn't do anything.

I hate this guy.

Stop it.

Terrible co-host energy.

You don't think that shifty is a good co-host?

I don't like it.

Why do you think?

What?

I don't think John gave us his gee does good co-host energy because he's jumping in a lot.

Oh sure.

This guy is terrible.

I know.

Bad.

Anyway, so the good news is we did do a 600th episode with Jason and Andy.

Was everything else the bad news?

Well no the bad news to me is it would have been really cool to have episode 600 be 600 second long.

Yeah it would have been pretty cool.

No 600 minutes.

600 seconds would be.

525,600 seconds.

Yeah 600 minutes is 10 hours.

That would have been awesome.

So that was in retrospect.

I wish I had been clever enough to do that but we would have meant that this episode would not have been recorded because we recorded this specifically to be episode 600.

This is an episode called Patrick McMahon Returns, a story about Johnny McGory.

So the Dink Dink man aka the TikTok man Jason and Zocus.

He is also co-host energy.

He and Andy came on and Andy decided to do a character that he hasn't done in a long time as I recall the Irish storyteller Patrick McMahon.

Patrick McMahon I think was maybe on in the first 100 episodes but hadn't been on for a while.

He had his own, Andy has his own podcast, the Andy Daily podcast pilot project.

And Patrick McMahon has an episode that you and I were both on.

It was a live episode.

It was a lot of fun.

A lot of fun.

And I did not realize I could not do an Irish accent until I started it.

And you said you said the word morch.

Instead of March.

Morch.

And then I saw that Broadway show this summer and I was like listening to their accident going oh that's how you do it.

And I figured like I could have.

Oh what show was that?

It was all about the collection agency.

All the collection agency.

No the the combo.

The cobbler.

What was it?

It was.

It was the something right.

It was the something.

It's not the fair.

It wasn't the fair well.

It was okay.

I'm looking at the Clippers.

The Clippers.

The fairy man.

Don't pay him.

Don't confuse it with the Irish man.

No.

This is the fairy man.

He's the man who drives the fairy.

Yeah anyway.

So I was like I wish I'd seen the fairy man before I did that episode.

But this was years apart.

How could I have?

There's no way.

What a stupid use of time travel.

In any case, this is Andy Daley who we previously heard on his Dalton Wilcox in earlier in our countdown.

And this is him.

He hasn't been on the show in a long time.

And this is just a fun episode where it's just Jason Andy and I having a good time.

And let's hear it.

This is your episode number eight.

Number eight.

As you know, I'm an Irish storyteller.

I tell old stories for the old country.

Old stories.

You don't write stories.

Yes, of course.

But I tell old stories and I tell new stories and I tell new stories about the old times.

Classic stories, Irish mythology.

You ever do a previously on during one of your stories and it's just the old story?

Previously on, no, I've never done a previously on Patrick McMaggon.

Previously on Patrick McMaggon stories.

And then it would be a story I had told before.

Is it like you're telling the oral history of your people?

Oh, sometimes it does feel like that, doesn't it?

But it's really sort of the old classic Irish mythology stories of we people and creatures and whatnot.

Oh, can I ask you a question about these stories?

Yes, but I've got a beef as well.

Can I just say I've got a real beef?

You want to start off with a beef?

I do want to start off with a beef.

I'll accept the beef.

Oh, yeah.

Because I specifically told the Booker, okay, sure.

Because I'm here, I'm promoting a show.

I'm promoting a tour of my own storytelling.

Oh, you're touring around.

I'm touring a flitter tour.

Yes, well, it's mostly pubs and street corners.

And I specifically told the Booker, I says, please, don't mention my brother, Seamus.

It's true.

My brother, Seamus is a very famous.

Oh, I cannot tell you what a fan I am of.

She's really straight.

I apologize from all the information we got with your Booker.

That was highlighted in circle.

It was.

Yes.

It was.

I remember my father introducing me to him when he was on PBS.

He had a special on PBS.

I remember that.

That was a very famous.

And that was back when nothing was on TV.

Nothing.

And so we were just like anything that's on TV.

And it was so funny.

When it wasn't that funny, though, interesting.

It says, you see, it wasn't that funny.

It was so funny.

And it was so heartbreaking too.

And I don't know.

No, that part never broke.

You have never broke a bunch of punch lines.

A lot of tears.

I don't think it would ever cry or laugh.

I don't remember crying or laughter with the shavings.

I remember my mouth, the corners of it going up and then the corners going down and just fluctuating going up down up.

I remember that was the first time I saw my father cry.

Yeah.

Was watching Seamus McVan.

It could have been allergy sees and he might have had something.

He might have had something in his eyes.

Perhaps, I guess.

Yeah.

We cry for all sorts of different reasons.

It might have nothing to do with Seamus's work, which is, you know, it's all right.

It's all right.

It's hard to account for his popularity.

I remember my dad again.

It's just that my dad was such a kind of- These are treasured memories.

Such an introduction to this world for me.

But you've talked about him.

He's a stoic guy.

He doesn't like crack on it.

He doesn't like Greek, you know, New England, you know, like all this kind of stoicism.

All this terrible.

The three sand New England.

But these kind of things would really kind of punctuate his stoic demeanor.

I remember he gave me Seamus McVan's, the record, stories about my brother.

Right?

That's a classic.

And that was like, I remember he won the Grammy for that.

Right.

He was- I mean, that was like a gold record.

Such a heartbreaking life that he had to put up with all those things.

Well, now that I'm thinking about it, that must have been about- That must have been- I didn't know you had that.

I didn't know you all the people in this country were familiar with it with the record stories of my brother.

Oh my God.

And my brother was like, a huge- I really had no idea that people knew about it.

I might not have come to America if I had known.

Oh, wow.

What stories of my brother by Seamus McVan was such a- Yeah, I mean, some of those stories about the things that you were up to.

Oh, and then the live record, more stories of my brother.

Oh, yeah, right.

And then the third in the trilogy of, hey, we're not going to be live anymore, but here are some more stories about my brother.

Because you wanted it, more stories of my brother.

That was a big argument because he felt strongly that the previous album had been live, and this one's not, you've got to say so in the title.

And it was a real argument.

Well, he got set the table.

But I think he was wrong.

I think he said exceptions.

People would have just accepted this.

Some of those stories he told about you, that's- Well, those are- you have to understand that Seamus is a liar and Seamus is an asshole.

And he's just the sort of person who would say whatever he wants to say without even thinking of the rape or cushions or without even thinking that for the rest of his brother's life, people are going to be coming up to him and saying, did you really try to cut off your own foot?

He hit like that.

That's the weirdest- that's- now that's ringing a bell.

Why would you try to- Because I was so inspired by the film, My Left Foot.

Yeah, but he had both of his feet.

He had both- it's just that he used his- Oh my God.

You were making me laugh so hard remembering it.

Were you inspired by it in just the title?

You didn't actually see it?

I had not gone to see it.

I'd seen the poster and I'd seen just the reviews of it and the people were excited about it.

They lose when they Oscar for that.

Well, that's the thing.

When you hear a title like My Left Foot, this is a guy who got his right foot cut off.

That's what you assume, all these guys just left foot.

So I- yes, of course.

Well, yes.

So that one is- that one happens to be true.

How did you try to cut it off?

Did you- I mean, I would imagine you'd have to strap your leg to it.

Maybe with a guillotine or something?

I mean, I can't even imagine.

I don't think you had to- No, no.

Doesn't it- It doesn't it get a- A foot guillotine?

A foot guillotine?

Well, I tried a lot of different ways in that one of them, but the first one was that just- You know, I did what you would do.

I went down to the train.

Sure.

I went to a train- I went to a train- I just put my foot off the train- Yeah, of course, of course.

Right.

Yeah, what happened with that one?

They just- where they saw me from far enough away?

Oh, they just stopped.

And I had to- I drank a whole lot of whiskey because I didn't want to feel it.

Oh, yeah.

And the next thing I know, I've got a train conductor kicking me their heads in.

Get your fucking foot off the train.

So you never cut off your foot or maybe you did, I'm not looking down there.

No, because at the end of the story, you know, Seamus says they didn't ever- he doesn't cut off the foot because when Seamus walks in and sees that he's in there, he yells at him, slaps him around.

Oh, that's- it's such a- a fun- but he says- tells it's so funny like- I just think it's slapping around my brother.

So many stories end with you getting slapped around and it makes me laugh so hard.

A lot of them do.

Your brother's like the three stooges.

He's just funny when he's slapping you around.

It made me understand what physical comedy is.

Yeah, really.

Yeah.

And without seeing it, too, because we're listening to these, you know, stories- Yes, just describe- He's just described- but the way he describes slapping you- Right.

And just the way you're crying and you're sort of begging and you're like- Well, now that- And what point you're like, hey, I'll, you know, perform oral sex on you if you stop.

No, you say- yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then you- you cry so hard that you shit your pants?

The funny thing is that it's actually- it's all happens the other way around.

It all happens the other way around.

When you shit your pants first- No, it's in this bag- He's in this bag- It's in this bag of pants?

It's in this bag of pants?

No, he doesn't.

He's never once shit my pants.

And I don't know if he claims to on any of his albums.

There is that one record.

I shit my brother's pants.

It's a 45.

And by the way, I fight the audience back.

That's the name of the record is a shit my brother's pants.

And by the way, I fight the audience back.

Yeah, I mean, that one was not very popular.

Maybe that was only in the States.

Yeah.

It's a 45.

It's a sure one.

Well, he's never shit my pants, but he's shit his own pants again and again and begs me to stop slapping him around.

That's what happens.

I slap him around.

That's right, I slap him around.

Why?

Why would you slap your brother?

He's an asshole and he's telling stories about- Well, that's not a good story.

The funny- the funny story is like look how dumb my brother is when I slap him around and he shits his pants.

The one where the story where you have your pants never did that.

The story where you go to the par, you get absolutely drunk and you buy a new Vespa and then, but when you show it to him, it's a sheep.

You bought a sheep and are riding it around thinking it's a Vespa.

And you're riding around thinking you're going as fast as a Vespa?

I need to say to all these Italian catchphrases.

No, that's not a Vespa.

No, no, that's happened.

I bought a sheep one night at a bar.

Whose name was Vespa?

And I did ride him home and he made up the rest.

He went wild and on the rest.

That's not too much to make up in this.

It's a very similar story you told.

And I did sell the car.

The only difference is the cognizance of the sheep.

I traded my car for the sheep because I thought it was going to be right in the sheep to work.

What kind of car was that?

The car that I had was one of them tiny little Trabons.

Oh, yeah.

Well, that's a kind of a lateral move then.

Do a sheep.

Well, that's amazing that you are here these 10 years later.

10 years later.

Touring.

9 years since the last time we've seen you.

Continuing to try and do the thing that your brother is the best at.

Well, but I'm better than him.

Right.

Let's say that.

Let's just get that out.

I don't remember every detail of episode 74, but I don't recall you necessarily blowing us away.

Well, here's the thing you talked about what a storyteller you are, but I seem to remember mostly just limericks.

Well, I'm from Limerick Ireland.

Oh, so you're a limerick man.

No, I'm not a limerick.

No, I don't do limericks.

The town is called Limerick, but I'm a storyteller.

And I do remember that being a confusion last time.

Because everyone books you expecting to hear wonderfully funny limericks.

A lot of the chimes.

So when you're from Limerick Ireland, that's your limerick.

And that's not.

Of course.

I recall that being a problem.

I wouldn't meet someone from Limerick Ireland and say, tell me a story.

No.

And you must know it.

I would not ask that of like somebody from Storyville.

You must know that they don't know that there's a place in Ireland called Storyville.

So that Irish story is a problem.

By that logic, you'd never get a story.

You must know some limerick so you can bust out in situations like this where people have booked you assuming that you know limericks and then you want to get paid for the gig, right?

Really, you're pride?

I haven't got any limericks.

You have so much pride that you refuse to learn limericks, even though it means you will not get paid for the gig.

That's right, Ritz.

Isn't that a rejection of your home place?

Yeah.

Of Limerick Ireland.

To reject a limerick is to reject your own town.

Aren't you proud of your heritage?

Do you have no pride in honour?

I have enormous pride in Limerick Ireland and love Limerick Ireland and it's not like people walk around telling limericks all the time.

Seamus McMahon has that three record set of limericks.

Oh yeah.

She has a lot of limericks.

Yeah.

Seamus has a lot of limericks.

Hi, Limerick's smarty smart low limericks which is all the dirty ones.

Right.

And then that whole third record with Limerick's.

I think he does.

Limerick's about my brother.

I can do a limerick.

What was the one limerick he said about Patrick?

Oh.

The one about like, oh yeah, he had a limerick about me.

It was a real good one.

Well, yeah, it was a little sicker.

Yeah.

And you remember?

Yeah.

It was all about, it was like, it was all about his, your bum.

It was, oh shit.

It was fun.

Bum, I think was where it was the right.

Yeah, it was an imperfect rhyme scheme.

Yeah, but it was funny.

But it was funny and humor trumps everything.

Yeah.

Wow.

So you do know Limerick's you're saying?

Well, sure.

If I can do a fucking limerick, anybody can.

Anyone can do anything.

Anybody can do anything.

You're going to be stupid to try.

Anybody can do it.

Sure.

What was an asshole named Seamus?

And everyone loved him because he was famous.

That's true.

But he was, I would say he's famous because everyone loved him.

Oh, he's, you know, what I mean?

One of the most famous people.

His work was so great that people loved him, which made him famous.

But anyway, go ahead.

But he was really a prick.

And he was really a dick.

And so thought our mother who named us.

Wow.

Pretty good.

That's almost as good as like a Seamus one.

Yeah.

I mean, so it really is very convenient that prick and dick.

Yes.

Very similar words that mean the same thing.

You know what I mean?

Like it's like there's, there are certain redundancies within that limerick.

Well, like a prick and a dick.

Yeah.

Means the same thing in its one meaning of a penis.

Well, it also means the same thing in its other meaning of, you know, a jerk.

Or.

Or to prick something as well, you know, I guess you can't dick something.

You can.

Dicks my finger.

You can dick something.

You can.

It is not exact.

So yeah, you know, you can dick some, some one.

All right, Jason.

Hey, oh, so ladies, if you single reach out to me at Scott Ockermann, Twitter, Dr.

Please do not.

I do have these ladies and I never pass them on to you.

So it's not right.

Yeah, which starts here.

Oh, really?

This is the start of the story.

It starts here.

It also certainly the pro.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, I was going to say not this podcast.

It starts at the tour of this podcast.

Do you want, would you like to tell a story?

I mean, is that.

And I remember the last time I was here, there was a bit of a confusion, perhaps a cultural problem that I tell stories about a character named Johnny McGorry.

And last time you guys were like, well, that sounds like it's a story about you.

But it's not stories about me.

It's a story about Johnny McGorry.

These are a fictional character who's very popular in Ireland.

Johnny McGorry.

Somebody you know?

Fictional.

No, he's just a fictional character.

Got it.

A fictional character named Johnny McGorry.

It's a lot like Jack from Fables.

There's a lot of Fables that have the name Jack.

It's a common thing.

So in Ireland, a lot of storytellers talk about Johnny McGorry.

Right.

Yeah, that's right.

They do.

It is right.

Sure sounds convinced.

Well, it's really my thing.

Oh, it's my thing.

So Johnny McGorry is a character that is your creation.

Like a Harry Potter is J.K. Rowley.

I can't say I invented him.

It's quite common for an Irish story to begin to tell you a story about Johnny McGorry.

It is.

Oh, great.

Right.

But it's really my thing more than anybody else at this point.

I've really taken it on.

I'm only saying this.

I only want clarification because I've never heard Seamus tell a Johnny McGorry.

No, he mainly talks about my dumb brother Patrick, my shit for brains brother Patrick with shit leaking out of his nose from his brain down into his mouth.

Which is not true.

That's a good example of something that's not true.

I think he refers to him mostly as the weed dumb cunt.

Yeah, which I think- Which is like two ways.

Think of that.

Think about that.

The weed dumb cunt.

Three insults in a row without redundancy.

Yeah.

That's impressive.

You're a little, you're stupid and you're that other thing which encompasses so much of the rest.

Well, he's a prick and a dick.

See, those are the same.

Yeah.

All right.

So Patrick, you're going to come down, sit down.

Please.

You don't need to stand.

Just sit down.

Now Patrick, you're going to tell us a story and this is about Johnny McGorry.

The aforementioned Johnny McGorry and this is- Oh, Johnny McGorry.

This is not about you.

Classic story from Ireland and Irish mythology.

Tell us how many beginners- Is that how you start normally asking people if you should?

Scott, he's in the middle of a story.

What are you doing?

Oh, sorry.

This is part of it.

Yeah.

I'll tell you a story about Johnny McGorry.

Well, once by the time there was a film named Johnny McGorry and he was a fabulous storyteller and everybody said so.

And everyone agreed and everyone loved him.

And he had a brother, Johnny McGorry did, who was a really pain in the ass.

He was a real jerk.

He was.

He was, he was, he was we and a dum and a cunt.

And nobody liked his brother.

And so one day, Johnny, to do a favor for the world, hit his brother over the head with a lamp and dragged him into the basement and tied him up and told him from now on, you're writing stories for me to tell.

And from that day forward, Johnny McGorry's brother was writing stories for Johnny to tell.

And then Johnny planned a big tour of America to tell those stories and become super famous.

And then he ran into a leprechaun and got his pot of gold.

That's the end.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

How do you think of that story?

Classic story of Irish mythology.

There's so little about it that has to do with being Irish.

Yeah.

It seems very specific to so much of it is just familial anger.

What do you mean?

Maybe that has something to do?

Tell him that we leprechaun in the pot of gold and Johnny McGorry.

That was just the last sense.

That seemed like a day.

Johnny McGorry always wants to get himself, he gets his hands on a pot of gold from a leprechaun.

Okay.

See, that was not set up in the beginning of the story.

Oh, yeah.

You think you would start with that?

You know, usually you start with the heroes wants.

Yes.

If there's going to be a quest for a pot of gold, we have to know that that's the quest.

This was like about abduction and familial jealousy.

Yeah.

You know, it's just occurring to me now.

What's that?

We haven't heard anything from Seamus McMahon since he tried to do that solo sale across the world.

Oh, yeah.

That was interesting.

All right.

I assumed he was lost at sea.

Well, I was reading his Wikipedia page earlier and I know there's some sort of question.

There's a subheading that says, presume dead with a question mark and citation needed.

Right.

I didn't know you'd know about that.

Yes.

That's missing.

That's too bad.

Really?

Do you remember the day that he went missing?

Live while ago.

A couple of months or something.

Do you talk about that in your show?

Do you tell stories about it?

No, no, no.

All the stories in my show, the exception of those two that I wrote live while ago are brand new ones.

These are brand new stories.

New and exciting stories.

That's great.

Remember what you recently written?

Do you remember what you were doing the day that he disappeared?

The day that James, the news must have come to you and just hit you like a thunderbolt.

Yes, it hit me like a terrible thunderbolt.

Were you up to that day?

I was, that day I was just sort of working on the basement.

I was doing some work in the basement.

What's going on in your basement?

That's interesting because Sheamus was, I mean, that's a Sheamus sorry because in your story.

John even more brother was locked up in a basement.

Oh, that's an interesting parallel.

But what's happening in your basement?

No, I'm just saying that the day that I heard that Sheamus was gone, I was just working on, because you know, we've got a basement door and the hinges are on the inside.

And so I was only just working on the door and sort of soldering the hinges closed.

Sold them close.

So when you were in the basement trying to solder the hinges closed.

So they couldn't be open?

Well, I don't know from within.

Don't leave any conclusions.

I'm just telling you what I was doing that day.

I was just working in the basement.

And you just got a call?

And yes, got a call to Sheamus.

Sheamus had been missing and was gone and turned up when he was expected.

I don't, I don't remember.

Are you kidding?

Of course he was married.

I mean, his wife was some people magazines like Sexiest Woman of the Year.

Sure.

And they shared the title of Sexiest Couple.

Yeah.

And she didn't know whether they still were married.

She was like that huge philanthropist.

She was on the verge of curing the Ebola outbreak.

Oh, yeah.

She got so close to that.

I know.

What happened?

Disappeared.

So all these people are dead from a bullet because and she disappeared too.

That was the other weird part.

Yeah.

Right.

Well, yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, some people say that she went looking for him and almost found him.

Almost found him.

Wow.

But nobody knows for sure.

Do you imagine the stories that he wrote before he disappeared?

Okay.

Great.

What's going on?

This is a what she might have we talked for a second.

You're going to have a talk.

We're just going to have a little review my new stories.

My brand new story, some of which I haven't even read.

But of course, I read the bar.

How did we not get this?

This is a Gallagher two scenario.

Gallagher's brother who sometimes performs as gay.

That's a Gallagher.

Sheamus doesn't want to perform anymore.

He's too big.

Sheamus too famous.

How about Sheamus too famous?

So he is writing new stories.

Sheamus too famous.

Yeah.

And he's letting his brother go out and tell those stories and that's how we're getting new.

And he's taking himself out of the public eye.

He just basically said that he asked his brother to write new stories and that's what he's doing on the road.

Okay.

So I think it's just so nice of him.

This is exciting.

Wow.

Okay.

Patrick, we would love to hear another.

Come on.

Come back.

We'd love to hear another Patrick McManus story.

Of course.

I know.

That's a giant Nagori.

One of the classic.

Sorry, McGory's.

Vision by Patrick McManus.

You're on Sheamus.

Yeah.

No, excuse me.

What'd you say to the stories that are by all by me?

These are all by you.

Of course they are.

Of course.

Why would you buy?

Vision by Miss A.

I was told by a wonderful magazine and even wonderful to hear it here from you.

Right.

All right.

You have another story.

Yes.

I've told this one before.

Great.

Very exciting.

I'm sure it will come out seamlessly as if it was perfectly written.

You bet it will.

Well, you know, these are sort of written and then memorized and then told in the traditional format.

I can't wait.

Sure.

Yeah.

All right.

I'll tell you a story about Johnny McGory.

And this is how it starts.

There was a fellow named Johnny McGory who was a real weed dumb cunt.

Always shitting in his pants and making a complete ass of himself.

He was a total asshole and an embarrassment.

And it was great fun to slap him around.

Anybody who could get within arms length of him would give him a fair slap and anyone around to see it would laugh and laugh and laugh.

He's just got one of those faces that it's an absolute pleasure to punch or slap.

And if you ever get him and yourself at the top of a flight of stairs, do yourself a favor and knock him down.

He'll tumbler out, sober, tea kettle and it'll be a laugh for everyone involved.

And then he'll get down in his knees and he'll beg you to do it again because he loves, loves, loves the attention.

What a pathetic weed dumb cunt he is.

Well, anyway, one day, Johnny McGory got it in his head that he was going to lock his brother in his basement, his fucking idiot of a guy, knocked his brother over the head with a salt lamp and dragged him into his fucking basement and tied him up.

But his brother was a lot smarter than he was, you see.

And so his brother managed to get halfway out the basement door before Johnny had a run down there and grab him and solder the basement door close.

What a fucking idiot watching him there with a sodden iron with his pants full of shit.

His pants are literally always full of shit.

His fucking jackass.

And then something happened that was really crazy because the doorbell rang and Johnny McGory's brother could hear his beautiful gorgeous wonderful brilliant wife upstairs saying, she must come missing and I know you did it, you fucking ass.

And then he heard the sound of slaps and he knew it was his wonderful wife, a slap in the hell out of Johnny McGory.

But then there was the sound of struggle and sure enough, down comes the wife into the basement.

And Johnny McGory tied her up too.

And so now they were both down there for a while and you might have thought they'd be sad or scared but all they could do day and night was laugh about what a weird, fucking cunt Johnny McGory was and what a stupid fucking plan he'd made.

And then finally, Seamus decided that he was gonna write a story.

Was that?

For Johnny McGory.

And so he wrote him a fucking story for him to tell it his little fucking tall of America.

And then he did something very exciting.

He remembered something Johnny wouldn't have known which is down in this basement.

There was some explosives from the times of the troubles.

And so he says to Johnny, can I wear your jacket because it's cold down here?

And Johnny gave him his jacket and he saw the explosives into the lining of the jacket.

And he sent a timer for them to explode at 11.59 AM on May the 6th.

And he bade farewell to his dear stupid fucking cunt of a brother for him to go on his wonderful tour of America.

The end.

Wait a minute.

Hold on.

Wait a minute.

Wait, there's a little post-script here.

And as these stories always seem to end for some fucking reason he saw a kelpie.

Number eight.

No.

Good stuff.

It is good stuff though.

You know what?

Here's what's funny.

Yeah.

I think we say the phrase good stuff and a lot of times we're not thinking we're not saying it consciously.

This was good stuff.

It's very exciting.

Very dangerous.

The danger is exciting.

Alright.

Let's take a break.

Alright.

Let's take a break when we come back we're going to be hearing from number seven.

Oh boy.

Lucky number seven.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

After this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back.

Welcome back.

We are on the best of 2019 part three of four and we have cracked the top ten and we are in the early stages of the top ten though.

Oh boy.

And this is.

Do you want to just get to it?

I feel like we're in the early stages of the top ten.

But certainly the midway of the countdown.

The early stages of the top ten.

There's nothing we can do.

We are definitely in the first seven tenths.

Yes.

I'm afraid to report.

The top ten.

Early stages of the top ten.

Let's get to it.

This is what you voted on.

You the listeners.

Let's get to you.

You're number seven.

Number seven.

Okay.

Number seven.

Lucky number here in America.

Certainly.

People love it.

I mean.

Love it.

If you hit it on the craps table sometimes it's great.

Sometimes it's great.

Sometimes it's terrible.

Sometimes people are like, yay.

Sometimes people are like boo.

Yeah.

Does anyone have done that on a craft table?

I have boo.

I have for sure.

To the dice.

Yeah.

Or to the roller.

If I see snake eyes come up.

Oh those snake eyes.

They remind me of snakes.

Kinda.

Dangerous.

But snakes of course represent the great deceiver.

Yeah.

Satan.

He speaks with a surface tongue.

He speaks with a serpent's.

Parcel tongue.

That's where you can speak to a snake.

That's Harry Potter.

Right.

Where snakes speak in Parcel tongue and certain wizards know how to speak it.

Right.

The boy who lived himself.

Harry.

Harry Potter.

So he can talk snakes.

Snakes.

Yes he can talk to snakes.

Snakes.

What is that?

I don't know that sound like what you were doing.

No I didn't mean to.

Why is having trouble talking?

No.

I'm in a cave.

Nigel Burning Funny Card.

They were telling us about the future.

Yeah.

They were telling us about the fuel.

Who cares?

Yeah.

Well I guess the Fast and Furious movies do because they're always like pun to the nitrous.

But is that the same as Nitro?

Probably I don't know.

Nitrous oxide laughing gas?

Oh all right you know who would know?

Siri.

Siri is Nitro the same as nitrous.

Here's what I found.

Siri what do funny cars burn?

What's the difference between Nitrogen?

What's the difference between Nitrogen and Nitrous Oxide is what Siri found and they say that oh this is a little it doesn't like if you're going to look up something just put the answer right at the top don't write a whole article about it.

Yeah well some people say yes.

I don't even know the anecdotal bullshit.

I can't even tell you anyway.

It's the Middle Ages people have been fearful of toadstools.

Get your own Siri if you want to know the answer to this.

You don't look to us for these kind of things.

Hey Scott get your own Siri this is my Siri.

This isn't like you.

This is my Siri.

The B was in my Siri.

Don't go using my Siri.

This is number seven.

Did we say number seven?

Your number seven?

Okay great.

So it's 584 Paul.

Oh so far away from the curious club.

From January.

Ciao ciao ciao ciao.

January 28th.

8th of 8th of 8th of 8th.

A year 11 months ago.

Wow.

Very early on in our not only our calendar year but our comedy bang bang eligibility year and this is an episode called Weird Amoni Alimony Tony.

I think I know which one this is.

Yeah I think you do.

I think based on that title it sounds I think I pieced it together.

We of course heard from Alimony Tony in the live in Chicago episode and we heard it.

Maybe for too long.

It's a long segment with Alimony Tony.

Oh we did but in the clip.

No I know.

We didn't hear that.

I'm just remembering it in my brain.

And this was the inception of the character and this is with John Hodgman our good friend John Hodgman and this is with yourself Paul of Tonkins as the aforementioned Alimony Tony.

Bill Heinz is also in this episode but he is not introduced yet in this clip.

And do you want to take us through the process of coming up with the character Alimony Tony?

Yes.

I think what happened was I was going to be I think on that episode of my you had planned on being someone maybe JW still water.

That's not ringing for some reason in pop tonight.

You were Michael Jackson.

I don't.

That's definitely not true.

It's definitely not true.

But I don't remember who it was but you came in and said hey I'm going to be this person.

It was an established character that I've done many times.

He's done many times.

And you'll hear it in the clip.

This is the earliest clip meaning this clip is the earliest in the show we are pulling a clip from.

Usually we pull these clips from about the 20 minute in.

Real deep in there.

This is literally the first moments of the show is where this whole saga begins.

And then you were reading that week's catch phrase and the person who submitted the catch phrase listed as their name Alimony Tony.

And that just tickled me.

You love that name.

It just got like a laugh.

You'll hear it in the clip.

But we all have.

That being a nickname is hilarious to me.

Yes.

And so you just jumped in as this guy.

Yes.

First I did a voice and said I kick boss.

Yes.

And you'll hear it.

And then I was sort of saying like okay I know you need to go because I assumed that you wanted to segue into the.

But you just decided to do Alimony Tony.

I was just enjoying it.

And came up with a great back story for him.

So we're going to hear a clip of that and hear all of that.

And you'll hear all of the wheels turning and Paul's brain and Sky wheels keep on turning.

And so let's hear it.

This is your number seven weird Amoni Alimony Tony.

Number seven.

Magneto only sips mojitos incognito.

I think he might have a drinking problem.

Welcome to comedy bang bang.

Thank you to Alimony Tony for that cash brace.

You know Alimony Tony always out there paying his XY as one narrow.

He loves it.

He's paying and proud of it.

He's really going to make this my nickname.

I love doing it so much.

I love that.

Corn orders so much.

My court ordered obligation.

Oh, somebody mentioned my name.

Oh, I don't know.

I love the Alimony Tony.

Oh, thank you so much for the cash brace.

I love bad Alimony.

How many XY's do you have Alimony Tony?

As many as I can get.

How many is that?

It's seven.

I love that.

Seven XY.

They're all beautiful.

I'm sorry.

It didn't work out.

It's my problem.

Maybe I got arrested development.

I need to grow up.

But I hear about people like you.

I love bad Alimony.

You said a lot like my other friend buddy.

What's his name?

What should I know?

Your friend.

Are you sure it'll sound different enough?

You didn't want it a very...

It'll sound different enough to hang her up.

I don't think you sound different enough to hang her up.

Let me get my throat.

When in the court?

That's the Alimony Tony.

Oh, hey.

There you are.

I love peg alimony.

There is something going around that changes voices that way.

I always wonder about someone like you who's a serial merrier.

Why do you marry so many women?

Why do you have issues that preclude you necessitating getting married?

I used to think that I got married for love because I just have so much love in my heart.

But now I realize I love paying alimony.

That's what it is.

It's the best.

That's why they call me Alimony Tony.

How much in Alimony are you paying per month now?

Well, let's see.

Let's see.

Per month, I'm going to say it's so worth the neighborhood of $12,000.

$12,000.

It's way up among the seven x-y.

No each.

Oh my gosh.

So we're talking $84,000?

I am providing alibones and they may live in the mad.

Which they become accustomed to.

Oh my God.

You're paying almost a million dollars a year in Alimony.

Oh shit.

I never did the math.

How much money do you make?

What if I do?

Are you independently wealthy?

I'm independently wealthy.

Oh, I see.

Okay.

How much money do you have in the bank?

My mother invented gaseous paper.

No.

I've heard of liquid paper but gaseous paper.

What's that?

Liquid paper is something that my nessmeth's mom invented.

Yeah.

From the monkeys?

Yeah.

What a fun bit of trivia.

No, my mother invented gaseous paper which NASA uses in the space program.

Oh, I see.

Did you also invent something akin to, did you invent VH1?

Like my nessmeth invented MTV?

I invented VH2.

Oh, okay.

Certainly less popular.

Well it's been very nice meeting you.

Well okay.

I might be back later.

Who knows?

Will you be back to pick us up later?

Ah, the Simpsons.

What's this?

I'm maybe moving.

Excuse me.

Who are you?

It's me, Alaboto.

Okay, I just, you were in shadow.

I was telling you I have warm ups.

Okay.

Why are you warming up?

Well because I'm going to be a guest of your show.

Oh, you are.

Yeah.

Alimony Tony.

You're going to be a guest of the show.

That's correct.

Okay.

He...

Wasn't there another guest sketchbook?

I didn't see anyone out there.

I didn't see anyone out there at the lobby.

We have the odds and endsmen coming up.

You know him from the catchphrase at the top of today's show.

Please welcome Alimony Tony.

Hello everyone.

Scott, thank you very much for using my catchphrase.

It's my pleasure when it's that good.

It's difficult not to use.

Thank you very much.

I appreciate that.

What do you do?

Are you other than you're independently wealthy?

You're the son of in the gaseous paper.

The heir to the gaseous paper fortune.

But do you do anything yourself other than write catchphrases?

I'm a bit of a weird owl.

I don't know quite what that means.

Do you write parody songs?

Yes, I write parody songs.

Okay.

Are you...

Here's one.

Because I was listening to your guest Mr. Huttman talking about himself.

He's a liar of empire.

He's an old town cryer.

That's from.

It's like I'm a joker.

I'm a toaker.

Yes.

Steve Billabad's song.

Right.

Some people call them Boris.

Who, the joker?

Yes.

Some people call them the joker Boris.

Why do they do that?

That is canon in the Batman universe.

I'm a monotone.

Does anyone ever call you weird alimony Tony?

I wish they would.

But no one does.

I wish they would call me weirdomone alimony Tony.

Weirdomone alimony.

Well, I will weirdomone alimony Tony.

Oh, I like the sound of that.

I like seeing it on a marquee.

May I ask a question on alimony Tony?

Of course you may.

I've been married for a certain number of years that I already forget.

And almost 20.

It's been a while.

Oh, wow.

In my secret family, I am the son of the secret family.

I'm not the husband and the secret family.

Right.

It's been a while since I've been on the market.

I've been a while.

I've been independently wealthy novelty songwriter without a particular audience.

Find a future wife.

Well, you've got to put yourself out there.

Okay.

And a lot of times I find that I take the advice of a movie I once saw.

I meet women in the supermarket.

Which movie was I?

Billie was very limited to 10 men.

Oh, 10 men.

And what I will do is I'll go up and down the aisle looking lonely and sad.

That's very attractive to women.

Yes.

Someone who's lonely and sad.

Well, to a certain type of woman.

Well, that's true.

There's a certain vulnerable type.

There's someone out there for everyone and I found seven of those.

You're hoping for the full dozen.

Yes.

From your lips to God's ears.

Mm.

If you get five more you'll be paying 60 more thousand dollars a month.

Unless I can restructure this alibody deal.

Right.

Okay.

Because that now we're talking this is going to cause a debt.

So were you to liquidate all of your assets?

How much money do you think that we're talking in cash?

US dollars.

Probably north of a trillion dollars?

A trillion dollars.

So no wonder giving away a million dollars a year.

Who cares?

Will you marry me?

And then divorce me and give me alibody?

Can I preside over this alibody?

Because I feel like you are my really good friend.

It's got marriage is very serious.

It's not a joke.

That's right it is.

Can I interview you about your love first?

You can kiss me on my forehead but not the other place.

I wish that a good job but I have to marry for love.

I have to marry for love even though I know I will eventually get divorced.

What are you looking for in a partner?

I like a lady with proud hair.

I thought you said you were marrying for love.

You're just in the tune for the brown hair.

I love brown hair.

Wait a minute Scott.

That's just one criterion.

Thank you.

You know he's just beginning a list.

Would you like to hear the criteria collection?

Of course.

Criteria.

It's not all going to necessarily be superficial.

Why isn't the criteria collection called criteria?

Criteria, exactly.

Ridiculous.

Anyway, brown hair never went with a bullet.

I like a lady.

Been way down below isn't it?

Man, a steep drop off to number two is such a fubor.

I like it.

When you say a cent of humor everyone has a cent of humor but it's their own particular cent of humor.

You mean one like yours?

Yes, exactly.

Where I say things that they laugh at it will we both agree that's funny.

Someone who loves popular songs reworked with new words.

Okay, so so far you've mentioned someone's physical attributes and two things that they like about you.

What am I the I love my curvy wife guy?

Come on.

I just said brown hair.

That's not that big.

You're her being curvy.

I don't buy that.

I don't buy this little guy with a little bit of the bones.

Okay.

I don't mind a gal who has very thick bones.

Thick bones and then not a lot of meat or one of the other.

Either very thin bones with a ton of meat or stringy meat with super thick bones.

You just like a certain shape.

However it gets there does matter to you.

Exactly.

Well because I bought my wife's clothing.

Okay.

And that's very nice.

That's very nice.

I keep a closet because there's nothing like it when you bring a lady home.

And you say I've got a whole closet of clothing for you.

Try it on.

Well she has to fit the clothes because when we get divorced I keep the clothes announced.

Right.

Is that in the prenup?

Do you ever sign a prenup?

I always sign a prenup.

Okay.

Always sign a prenup.

And part of this prenup is I'm going to give you.

I'm definitely going to give you money.

Oh yes.

The prenup is very brief.

It simply states should we get divorced?

You will get $12,000 a month.

And I got to keep those clothes.

I got to keep those clothes.

Is it worded like that?

I got to keep those clothes.

It's a masterisk.

There's a lot of legal mumbo job over at the bottom of the bottom.

Has the wardrobe evolved and been added to since wife one or just wife one?

What year was the first?

It's updated as the fashion's changed.

So you throw some out?

Well, I can't do that.

It expands.

I treat them like the American flag and I burn them.

What's there?

No longer fit for service.

I have a ceremony where I burn them.

I play a bugle.

Yeah.

And I burn them on top of the oven.

So you play the bugle as well.

So you are a musician.

I play one song in the bugle that is taps.

Oh, beautiful song.

Did you?

Have you ever written funny lyrics for taps?

Of course I have.

Let's hear some.

Burning clothes, burning clothes.

There it goes.

All the clothes smoke in my nose.

I'm divorced.

And now I'm forced to burning clothes.

Burning clothes, burning clothes.

So you know the song?

Yes.

A big fan.

I didn't know where that came from.

I saw it on YouTube.

Yeah.

Well, that explains the one view.

Well, too.

I watched it.

I don't know how I came across it.

What led me there?

I got down into a YouTube hole.

Were you search a song parody?

I may have been.

Did you just type the words song parodies into YouTube?

And then you looked at every single listing it got down to body.

I did not look up the word weirdomony though.

So I didn't get to it there.

I'd like people to look up the word weirdomony.

Weirdomony, Alimony, Tony.

Weirdomony, Alimony, Tony, that's me.

So you, when was your first wife?

What year?

When was your first wife?

When did you get married to your first wife?

You know what I mean.

1998.

So you, so it's been 20 years.

We had a very big marriage.

It only lasted a year.

And then I think she married someone else.

She did.

Who is this?

What was her name?

Herdiboos, Catherine.

Catherine?

Wait, what?

Yeah.

What's that?

Nothing.

It was just that I had to do my wife's name.

Oh.

How, what did you get married?

September 25th, 1999.

Oh, it's very interesting.

And she has brown hair.

Mm hmm.

What?

Can I ask you a question, John?

Did you have big bones with a little bit of meat?

Or did she have tiny bones with a lot of beef?

Is that all women can be described?

One or the other?

It's strange.

I don't think about women that way.

So you couldn't even hazard a guess publicly.

I've not seen a cross section of her body.

Okay.

What was your wife's maiden name, if I may ask?

And did she change it to Hodgman?

No.

And no.

Well, I may not ask the former and she did not change it to Hodgman.

Correct.

Okay.

So you could try guessing again.

You're a good guesser.

I really like ruled out one.

Which one?

Hodgman.

Okay, is it Hodg Woman?

How do you do that?

Now this is...

Now this is strange.

Oh my goodness.

Because I was married to a woman named Catherine Hodg Woman.

Catherine Hodg Woman was your previous first wife.

This is too much of a coincidence.

I'm speechless.

As am I, although I'm talking.

All of a sudden I realized that my wife gets $12,000 a month.

I'm just walking around my...

I have no knowledge of.

She hasn't shared it with you?

Wait a second.

I'm remembering now all those checks coming back to me.

Unopened.

Return to send her.

Address unknown?

She wanted nothing to do with me after we got divorced.

Well, I love my wife very much, but that was dumb.

You're curving wife?

I want that money.

I'm sorry, John, the guy has cast.

Catherine said no.

She doesn't want the money.

Hang on, I'm going to text her.

Okay, sure.

Do you mind if I send her a picture of you?

I don't mind at all.

I love having my picture taken.

Oh, wow, you're really posing.

I love how they're posing.

You're hitting all those pose, all those angles.

Damn.

That's what it's about.

It's about tiny micro adjustments.

That's the key to getting your picture taken and getting it over with.

Dear Kath, were you married to this moment by any chance?

Also we need eggs.

She probably would only know me as Tony.

I didn't say your name.

She wouldn't know you by picture, by sight.

He sent a picture.

She would only know Tony.

Did you disguise your face?

We got married to the dark and we lived in the dark for a year.

One of those dark restaurants?

Yes, exactly.

I thought that's the way to live.

The greatest first blind date.

Exactly.

That was our first date.

Almost literally blind.

That was our first date in 1998.

We went to one of those completely dark restaurants.

We had to let's keep this going.

It's such a wonderful time.

I said, why should we tap it with this?

I never want to find out if your hair is brown or not.

If this is true for all your wives, the color of the hair is really immaterial.

No, that was just the book.

I don't do the same thing.

I don't live with all these women of the dark.

No, of course not.

You don't do the same thing among your seven wives.

You just make them wear the same clothes.

Each of my relationships is unique.

John, have you gotten a text back?

No, because I put my phone on airplane mode because I respect the studio.

Oh, okay.

We're never going to get an answer.

Put my phone on airplane mode.

Dude, dude.

That was your other one that I went to.

You saw that one too?

Yeah, I'm the second view.

Number seven.

Ah, yes.

Good shit.

That voice is a voice that I love doing and it's based on Mario Parillo.

Who's out of praise?

He's this guy.

I don't know if he's still with us.

But I used to see these commercials when I was...

What is the price?

I can't see that I brought him here.

What?

There's something called Club Parillo, which were these prepackaged tours that you would take, I guess, in Italy.

Oh my God, it was Mario Parillo.

Hi, Mario Parillo for Parillo tours.

And he would marry the commercial and everything you would get.

And I just loved his...

I've been imitating him since I was a kid and never used it for a character before.

And it just sort of happened for Alan and Tony.

Wonderful.

And that's a really funny character.

And as heard before, you brought him back in Chicago and hopefully we'll bring him back again because he has a great back story.

You haven't seen the last of Alan, Tony.

Who have we seen the last of?

Oh boy.

I see.

Yeah, for sure.

Why do you...

Other than the person in real life passes away, why do you retire a character?

If they are real people, it has become less interesting for me to do them just because they...

Because there are real people and there is some...

They're still to me some relation to fact, if that makes sense.

Yes.

You're constrained by the limits of what the public knows about them already.

To a certain degree.

I mean, my approach to those characters is always to make up a crazy thing about them and make that the thrust of it.

But also, it becomes a little boring after a while.

You know, having to come up with a new bit, a new game for this same character over and over again.

Although I will say on tour you trotted out some of the old favorites of the people who are real people, Cake Boss and Pivren or Herzog.

Yes, because I hadn't done them in quite a long time.

Yeah, you hadn't done them in a long time and they were great.

And you found new wrinkles and much like I do every morning looking in the mirror.

Scott.

Now, you look the same as you did last year.

Thank you, but not the year previous.

Oh, you wouldn't dig too deep.

Really age.

Take the compliment.

365 days.

Well, anyway, a weird Amoni Alimony Tony, great new character.

All right, let's go to a break.

When we come back, we're going to hear number six.

We're so close to the top.

So close, I get to to to to my mouth.

All right, we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We are here.

We are here and we're doing the best of 2019 part three.

And I'm here with Paul F. Tomkins, of course, who is not left.

No, I stayed at it the whole time.

You have there was one year where you did leave.

Do you remember that where you said, I didn't think this was going to take so long.

I got to go and just left.

And so we reconvened another day.

Yes.

It was like right at the break in the middle of maybe our third out of four episodes.

And we talked about it on the thing, but it was just like after, you know, after a break, just days elapsed and he came back.

And that's when we decided to start a lotting an entire day for the.

By the way, this is a long day for me because I have this, which is still happening.

It certainly is.

And I have an improv show tonight.

Right.

And I have something after that.

And then I have a I have a dinner reservation at 9.45 p.m.

Whoa.

Where are you going to dinner?

This is.

I don't want to sit by the time people here.

Oh, because it's summer you go all the time and you don't want people to lose.

It's we're going to the Tamil Shantor.

Oh, okay.

There's six of us and that's a very popular restaurant at this time of year.

Yes.

Because they really do it up for Christmas.

And this was the only reservation we could get for interesting because I am by the time people hear it, I will have been to the Tamil Shantor the following night.

It's very true as well.

It's also true.

Oh, you are going to be there.

Oh, okay.

I think I'm going to be there.

I hope you are.

Yeah.

But I will I go to this restaurant a lot during the Christmas season.

And this will be tonight will be my.

Third trip in the Christmas season.

Yes.

Okay.

Then tomorrow, fourth then.

Do you hope to go again?

Oh, tonight.

Yeah.

I will go again.

I'm going to go again when Janie's family is in town.

Janie's got a family in town.

Very exciting.

Very dangerous.

Well, that's fun.

The holidays are fun and they are almost over because I mean today is December 30th, obviously, and tomorrow's New Year's Eve.

And then by the time we reconvene for our top four, it'll be the day after New Year's day January second.

What do you do?

Today will be in an undisclosed location in a bunker.

Oh, shit.

They are squirreling me away to protect me.

They're going to make you into a squirrel?

They are.

And you know, they cool up and I can't travel together in case.

Of course, something were now.

Yeah, exactly.

We need to call each other in case it's emergency.

Hey, can you get down here?

I was quarreled.

I got a flat in Brazil.

But yeah, I'll be somewhere.

Don't worry about me.

Not going to Tokyo this year.

I'll tell you about it after the fact.

Nah, I got Tokyo.

Not got to do.

But I will be there currently when this episode comes out.

So I do not want to tell anyone.

I'll be there in spirit.

Good.

Yes.

I hope that you will die and haunt me.

Do you want me to haunt you though?

Out of anyone to haunt me?

Would it be worse if it were a friend?

Like, what if I, well, I mean, I guess if it's a friend, like, what if it's a friend like haunting where it's just like you make weird things happen.

You're not trying to scare the person.

I wonder if the haunting would be executed differently.

If it were executed exactly the same, but it were by a friend, would it be easier to take or would it be worse?

You're like, hey, you're a friend of mine.

Why are you doing this?

I mean, you don't know what the, what it is that the, the haunt is trying to communicate.

Is all haunting trying to communicate something or is it just like, look, I'm stuck around here.

And if I'm stuck here, I'm going to frighten the shit out of you.

I think some hauntings are like, hey, this is my space.

I'm trapped here.

My house, my rules.

If my rules are, I'm ooshing around.

I'm wearing noises.

I sit on the end of your bed.

Oh, man.

Do you hope you're a ghost or do you just want to go?

No, I'm going to be a fucking ghost.

At least you'd still be here.

It sounds horrible.

I'm scaring people.

It's kind of fun when you do it like on Halloween in a haunted maze.

I don't know.

If I were a ghost, I'd want to be a haunting ghost.

If I were a ghost, this is a parody of the Beyonce song.

If I were a boy, I would want to be like a haunting and real house ghost like that guy that has the big, long cane and floats around looking for his hat.

He looks cool.

He's a cool guy.

And you get to wear a hat.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

That'd be fun.

He was a cool guy.

He was a very cool guy.

I liked him.

I mean, I liked him liked him.

You had a crush on him?

I'm scared to do it myself.

I can't believe you didn't say something before.

Would you tell him?

Yeah, it's of course.

I'm scared to do it myself.

I don't want to say anything, but I think he's a crush on you too.

Oh my God.

Yeah.

Ask him if he wants to go around with me.

Go around.

That's what we said when I was young.

Do you want to go around with me?

Not ghost Eddie.

It was weird.

Not a ghost Eddie.

You know that New York Times article that we were looking up onto are about like the certain things at a pin point where you lived by asking you 12 questions I believe that of various regional sayings.

It was amazing.

They said that I was from Santa Ana, which is the town over from where I lived.

It was crazy.

And every person who took it.

But what if they did not include going around in there?

Wait, did they was that in there?

No, going around was not.

That may have only been specific to that particular like year at my only my school.

And maybe it could have been because someone misheard going steady or something.

Yeah.

I it's somebody says I know it was like a go with each other.

They would they would just say that.

But that there's a word we may have talked about this before, but the word John is a is a Philadelphia slang term.

Yes, right.

That evolved after I left there.

So you never said it?

No.

But that word was not a word.

It means like thing.

It means like a situation, you know, yeah, it's like it's like an all purpose kind of word that is used.

It's used liberally, but always specifically there's there's definitely things places times where you would not say it.

Okay.

My mother uses deal.

It's kind of like that.

Yeah.

So that deal.

Yeah.

So bring me the deal over there.

Yeah.

It's kind of like that.

Bring me the join over there.

Yeah.

I want to give you a kiss on your big smackers.

I want to give you a smooch.

So you never said it.

So when you hear younger Philadelphians, they say it.

They say it.

It's written in print a lot.

Really?

And how's it spelled?

J.A.W.N.

John.

See people using an advertising and stuff like that.

Interesting.

The first John is on us.

The first John was on us.

First John is on us.

Okay.

Like it's a deal.

The first John is on us.

Interesting.

Are you trying to do an accent?

I don't do the Philadelph.

The first John is on us.

Really?

No.

What is the Philadelphian?

The first John is on us.

No.

You don't have it.

No.

Come down to get some chicken peat scrap fries.

I do.

If you do, the first John is on us.

First John is on us.

Better.

I do like hearing it when on like like newscasters or when I hear it creep in to people.

I always laugh and I look up where they from.

And I think Neera Tandon is she's like a commentator on.

Yeah.

And so I heard her say, you knew once and I was like, where's he from?

And I looked it up and that was exactly where she was from.

Who did you just have on the show?

Who's from Philly?

From Ferns.

Philly from Ferns.

The documentary.

Oh, uh, uh, uh, Rika.

Rika.

Yeah, Rika Shankar.

She's from Philly.

You know, you knew.

Yeah, there's a couple words where it creeps in with her.

The news.

Those are hard.

Those, those, those are hard.

Those are hard.

I would love to have this be a stitch or premium show.

You just teach me how to do a Philly accent.

And by the end of the 10 minute episode, I'm perfectly fluent in it.

Yeah.

All right.

Have we, where are we?

Number six.

We are.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm here too.

Okay.

And we've taken the break.

This is the part of the episodes, by the way, where we get lost in it and don't know if we take it to break.

We're just about to do it, right?

We've eaten less lightheaded though for some reason.

Yeah.

All right.

Let's get to it.

This is your number six.

Number six.

Okay.

Number six.

We're still lost in what we're doing.

We're lost in the sauce.

And you're the boss.

All right.

This is another relatively recent one.

This is episode 622.

This is an episode and this is from October 7th.

So this is just outside of the curious club.

Yep, it certainly is.

This is an episode entitled Hello Coffin, Rudy North Returns.

Oh, dear.

Yes.

Oh, dear.

Have you heard this episode?

Probably.

Probably not, I would say.

This is with Jason Manzukas, Sean Distan, Lily Sullivan and Tim Balts.

Mm hmm.

Okay.

So there's a couple of, we heard from Tim Balts earlier in the countdown.

We heard his Righteous Gemstones episode where he was playing Randy Snuts.

And we're going to hear a little bit of him as well.

But since we haven't talked about them yet, let's talk about Sean Distan and Lily Sullivan.

Shall we?

Let's do.

First of all, Sean Distan, really funny dude.

I believe I first had him on the show, Lauren Lapkis texted me and said, Hey, you got to have Sean Distan on.

He just did her show, which was with special guests.

Yes.

Lauren Lapkis.

I think he did a genie on that one or something like that.

He did.

He played Skelo.

Oh, he played a genie on Comedy Bang Bang.

Yes.

The show was about wishes.

Right.

And Lauren played Frank Dorito, who had said, Get his book of world records for making the most wishes.

Right.

So anyway, Sean came on and I thought it was really funny and but then pretty early on, he started doing this character Rudy North, rudimentary North.

And then proclaimed himself to be a fan favorite.

Yes.

And kept talking about how he was a fan favorite and it came true.

Yeah.

He really made it.

He's secretive that shit.

He made it up.

He did.

He made it come true.

He's always really funny on the show and Rudy North, I think his first episode was on one of our previous best ofs in a previous year where he essentially what he is, he's a dirt bag guy who and when Sean first brought him in to do his, his main, the main thrust of his character was that he would take over people's jobs by punching them in the throat and just taking over their jobs.

And that was enough.

Twil do.

But then at the end of the episode, he casually threw out that he was immortal.

Yeah.

But didn't have time to go into it.

And it was just at the right as we were ending the episode.

It was a boring story.

And then since then we've been unraveling his backstory.

But he still always says he doesn't have time to go into it.

So earlier on episode 600, I believe that he died and went to hell and took over Satan's job maybe.

And every time he also is on the show, he would do his own previously on comedy bang bang and he would then recap what he had been up to.

So this is episode 622.

The first thing that we're going to hear, by the way, I'm not even talking about what gave the episode its title, the pillow coffin.

That was an argument that Jason and I got into, which eventually the fans all wrote to me and said that I was right and I was correct on the right side of the argument and I appreciate that, everyone.

And Jason essentially lost the argument in the court of public opinion.

And so I appreciate that.

What is a strange moment that I was surprised when on as long as it did?

Well, I knew what you were saying.

Yeah, you know what I was saying.

Yeah, absolutely.

And I agree with you, by the way.

Yeah.

And he took weird offense at it and wouldn't let it go.

And thankfully the fans are all on my side and have castigated him and he shall be cast out of the show and never be on again.

If I know I offend me, fuck you.

But in any case, I'm not even going to play any of that clip because I want to play clips from these three great performers.

And then Lily Sullivan is someone we should also talk about.

She started doing the show relatively recently within, I believe, the last eligibility year from was her first episode.

And she is a great improviser from Chicago.

Yeah.

And we got to know her and she started doing the episodes.

And she's another person that I really enjoyed doing the show with.

Lily's so funny and I was so glad to hear her on the show so much over this past year.

Very solid, always is reliable and dependable on time.

But I mean, like brings it, you know what I mean?

Yeah.

Like there aren't episodes where it's like message receives, Scott.

You're in so many of these.

Yeah, but I don't always bring it and I know that you mean we went on tour together.

I know and you're keep everyone loved it.

I know you're always like, I hope he brings it.

I tell you that right before every show.

You better fucking bring it.

You introduce me that way.

And he better bring it this time.

I hope he brings it.

But Lily's great.

And I would like to see more of her come 2020 and more of her next year's best-ups as well.

So we're going to hear, we're going to hear first of all Rudy North coming back from the dead.

And then we're going to hear Lily Sullivan, who is playing a journalist Virginia Patricia.

And then we're also going to hear Tim Balz, who debuted a character that he just returned to on our two weeks ago on the holiday episode, Darren Matichek, who runs the National Bobblehead and Hall of Fame Museum.

So the three different clips, three different people, let's hear it now.

This is your number six.

Number six.

Our next guest takes, well, this needs to be set up a little bit.

It needs a little bit of explaining if that's possible.

Previously on Comedy Bang Bang.

I am a dirtbag.

You're my best friend.

I love you for the last three years.

I mean, yes, I'm a mortal.

You were also a magical being who...

That's not important, Scott.

I was walking down the street.

Just the other day.

I got a new job.

Scott, I'm the devil now.

The devil himself?

This is the last time I can appear on the podcast.

What?

No, you're one of our favorite guests.

With every second I am outside of hell, my power grows weaker, Scott.

And it was evidence of an enemy who's been hunting me down since, well, the very beginning of time.

Now that I'm in hell, well, there's room for this enemy to run free, Scott.

This enemy is my daughter.

Hi.

Hi, hello.

My name's Judy.

Oh, hello, Judy.

Judy, North.

Oh, she may come in the form of another comedic character.

You will never know, Scott.

Rudy, don't go.

I'm the owner of the Donut Shop.

I know the fans are going to be so sad.

I think they will be your one of our favorites.

Yeah.

Good bye, Scott.

Good bye, Rudy.

Good bye.

It's been a long time.

That should have left you without a dopant.

Of course not.

The force.

It's calling to you.

There's no way that in some commonly turned events I might appear again in the future.

I got big notes and if you're good at critter size anything, you got to critter size by a dump.

Hello, Scott.

Rudy, Rudy, North.

I'm from Jordan, Scott.

I'm here.

I'm back.

He's back.

I do.

That was huge.

Hello, Jason.

Good to see you, Rudy.

First of all, you got to know I'm coveted.

Well, not as piping hot as usual.

Usually you're fresh out of the oven.

You are coming in a little less hot to be usable.

You seem a little somber a little.

I mean, that was a contemplative.

It was contemplative for sure.

I definitely am coming in hot, but just not as hot.

I mean, I would not want to touch you with a bare hand.

I'm still sweating a little bit.

How you doing, Scott?

I'm great.

I'm Jason.

How are you?

You know, Rudy, I'm terrific.

I just want to say I loved you on Legion.

Thank you so much.

I appreciate that, Rudy.

It was incredible.

It was great.

Thank you so much.

I got a catch up with that.

It was like a wolf or something.

Anyways, I'm glad to be back, Scott.

Yeah.

I mean, as everyone who listened to that previously on to tell.

I had a quick question on this previous one.

Yes.

I just showed recently where a tie fighter was on the show.

And someone talking about the force because I distinctly heard a tie fighter pass by me.

Yeah.

Well, of course, I do want to say I'm back from hell.

I'm no longer the devil, Scott.

You're no longer the devil.

Okay.

Rudy North has been on the show for a few years at this point.

Yes.

A few years.

And of course, that quickly became a fan favorite, but it was a bit of a shame.

Self-proclaimed.

But of course, self-fulfilling prophecy.

I just want to chop it up with my friends.

And I don't really want to talk about the long journey it took for me to do.

What do you think?

What do you want?

Chop it up a salad like a Cobb salad.

You know, I'm not a big salad guy.

Same.

I'm with...

I'm with the...

That of course is candid.

I'm big on the couscous as sort of like sort of ancient grains.

Oh, got to love those quinoa.

I love a quinoa.

Ooh.

That's good for the couscous is good for the gander gator.

Dang.

Did she say that?

I think he might have.

What I want to know that...

Okay, let's not talk about your very complicated background.

Yeah, because I think that's going to be a stick of premium show or something.

Yeah, this may be a...

What I heard?

Just unpacking the rudimentary noise.

Yeah.

From what I heard the last six months getting from hell to earth is a epic story that I think is about six episodes of his history.

A Homeric Odyssey.

Oh, wow.

They're calling it a podcast opera.

So you're angling for a stitch or pre-mandating?

No, I'm not angling for anything.

You know, this is smart though because if the fans demand it, like the earwolf will have to give it to you.

It's just on these shows, we don't have time to talk about it.

We don't have time to get into these things.

But if we do want to get into it, no, no, we don't.

Let's talk about what you want to talk about.

What's going on?

Well, I'm looking for a new job, Scott.

You're looking for a new job.

Okay.

And it's a lot harder than it used to be, Scott.

Yeah, so your last job, of course, was being Satan in hell.

That was being Satan in hell.

Of course.

But it's not really something that translates to an application.

No, because look, I have a lot of experience, but then they ask how you got the job and I'm like, magical powers.

Is that part of the application?

How'd you get the job?

It's like what job experience date, beginning date, or ending.

And then how'd you get this job?

I would also assume that looking at your resume would be like a really eclectic group.

It'd be really crazy.

Santa.

It'd be like, donut shops.

It'd be Lyft driver, Target employee, donut shop owner.

Santa Claus, the devil, Christmas tree salesman.

They're going to ask me why I'm such a journeyman, Scott, and I don't have an answer for him.

Yeah, I understand.

So what field of worker are you looking to get into?

Well, Scott, the other day I was walking down the street, of course.

It was the other day, of course.

It was the other day.

I was walking down the street and I walked past KCRW.

Okay.

That is a local to California, Los Angeles radio station.

A public radio station.

And because it was public, I thought, they can't stop me from coming in here.

It's like a library.

Guess what?

Your taxpayer dollars built that whole thing.

Exactly.

As far as I'm concerned, and this, I think, is the truth for anybody in the world, in this country, rather, not the world, you can go into any public radio station and they have to put you on the Internet.

They have to give you a drive time DJ.

You have to be in, because that's what NPR is all about, drive time DJ.

I mean, we talk about the open door policy here, but I mean there.

Yeah, anyone can.

So right now I'm the sidekick for a Zukru, a morning Zukru radio station.

I'm a Zukru.

Casey, I'm a W.

Nick, I'm a K.C.R.

W.

Nick, I'm a K.C.R.

W.K.

Nick, I'm a K.C.R.W.

Yeah, it's in journal as a editorial as editorial is not as reviews so not in the arts section no as editorial you are you a lot of opinions contained within your oh, yeah, yeah, I got to say you are on the masthead. It's not a letter to the editor No, it's an editorial great. It's editorial. Yeah, and so you know for example in this case I like to go to the talk back after the play and then I Great shows have yeah, so I said this one I said to him. I said when I saw angels in America I was like where's the talk back. Yeah, I know I've spent I said six hours here I said I want to talk back Tony Kushner out here. I got a lot to say yeah So I said at this one I said I got up and I said so you go alone by the way Did you know anyone in the play? Why did you know not a soul not a soul and I said I stood up I stood up. I said first of all the theater's freezing. I don't understand how you expect us to watch this I'm frozen to the bone and secondly how what was the temperature could you get a good Steve nine?

That's I mean, that's a hilarious temperature I mean that's like I sound like so I know you want a high five right now That's not that kind of show Over other idea we go. I mean all right. Let's just get it All right, all right, okay. We got it. All right good. My lips were blue my lips are You blew with your lips in the 69 okay? I don't know what you're trying to get at it This was the first thing you said this was the first thing I said I said it was it the first thing anyone said We first arise to your feet. Absolutely. Can I ask you a question? Were you the only person at the talk back?

There were some people cleaning up. Okay. Oh were they talking back? Was this a formal talk back?

Or were you just talking back to the people who were cleaning up and kind of breaking the stage some of the actors like came out To be their family you know, they were you know They were around and everyone's everyone's talking about the show giving each other compliments I said hold on a second because I got a couple other things to say I said first of all Real basic approach to doing Oliver, right? We could have did something fun set it in the 70s now you said You said we could have We could have done something fun, but you have no involvement in this production. No, no I I my son went to the rival school when he was when he was coming up. Oh, okay but coming up where When he was growing up or he was coming up and So I said this has nothing to do with that, but okay, this is absolutely You know you guys could have had something fun here the or seven days Production of Oliver be like with everyone with like Afros and Exactly the orphans. Let's put that in the 70s, right? Let's do disco Platform shoes tiny little boys in bell bottom pants. Sure.

That's not a stretch that the audience would be on board for that Sure, so your review is a full suggestion on what genre to change the play to you and your review forgive me Sounds a lot more like note. Yeah, it's kind of like you want to be to do it Well, they publish it and guess what everyone was up in arms with me. That's irresponsible other newspapers You got to talk to so many people down at the newspaper She's not gonna talk to them Man, I just wow yeah, I don't know Can I ask you a question? Yeah, have you ever thought about coming out of retirement to maybe direct some of these plays? Oh God well, I'm a very busy woman at home. What did you retire as?

Your career I was the CEO of a One of those companies that makes the pillows that has sayings on them sayings on them one of those pillows that has sayings one of Those companies that has been you were the CEO of a company.

You'd rather not mention you just say it's a what And so you know pillows like live love die Message those inspirational pillows So if you die in your sleep they just turn the pillow around that's fun smaller feet keep you closer to the stove things like that I don't know Right knees when you were working there. Are you right?

Okay, and I was hiring the people who wrote them mostly family members Was this your company were you the CEO of your own company?

Yes? Well, it started as my father's company But I myself made woman and I inherited it. Oh, oh those two things was it a pillow company when your father had it Oh, it was it was um, but it was more like the pillows that you guys were talking about long pillows long Like you shortened the pillows and added sayings to them exactly so you went from a Sleep pillow to a decorative pillow company. That was your innovation for your family's business Exactly. I was the business now when you say you're arriving Well, it's we're good online You are you good online so it still exists online, but brick and mortar no longer. Yes Did you have brick and mortar pillow stores is that a thing we did that seems like What was it called pillows and more something like that called don't forget that pillow don't forget that But we'll have to get the most people forget the pillow Yeah, when you're shopping for something you can't forget it when it has a saying right yes You never forget the saying on a pillow right was did any say never forget and have like a picture of the Twin Towers sure falling we did have one with the Twin Towers, but it didn't say anything oh Okay, cool smart. I like that Was it one of those pillows that you could like run your hand up and down it would change the image And so in one image the towers are standing and the other they have crumbled around you know They didn't make that technology told recently, but I would hire you anything about control demolitions or oh What about building seven is that in any building seven pillows? Oh God 9-11 with an inside beams. I wish anything that's like little feet keep you closer to the stove 9-11 was an inside job No nothing like that So daren it's so nice to meet you you're a and historian and historian and an entrepreneur Oh great. Okay. We have a lot of entrepreneurs on the show not as many historians and are the two related Did your entrepreneurial spirit come out of your historian kind of Career it did it did the passion that I wanted to pursue and my hobby grew into my entrepreneurship I am the co silent co-founder of the national bobblehead hall of fame and museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Oh, wow the national Bobblehead museum is how he said and hall of fame and hall of fame hall of fame for bobbleheads or hall of fame Well, that's fun because it gets sports people in it and you know what?

The the inductees into the hall of fame are the hall of famers of the sports themselves. It's not like It's just bobby. Are you inducting?

Yeah, we're inducting bobbleheads not okay This is why we ask but funny thing funny you should mention bobbleheads are usually of people Sure and sometimes animals a fire you is the hall of fame.

I'm so sorry to clarify That's all right is the bobblehead the hall of fame mocks box. Okay. I just wanted to make sure That is the bobblehead hall of fame Represent the hall of fame or sports figures that are have bobbleheads so like for example Or are they just go bobbleheads p rose is ineligible to be in the baseball hall of fame But he could be such a good bobblehead. Yeah, that's what i'm asking Could his bobblehead be in the bobblehead hall of fame?

Yeah, not to further confuse things, but it can Great. What about what about that fox? Did he get into the hall of fame? Yeah, the really good fox did the good one did Yeah, how many foxes are in there uh two two okay, but the really good one was yeah There are two really good ones that are in there. Well also peterose bobblehead is in there Yeah, they're in bobblehead is in there. Okay, i said cruise bobblehead is in there What makes that bobblehead? Yeah, hall of fame hall of fame bobblehead Uh pretty much someone saying hey i'm mailing you my bobblehead will you put it in your hall of fame But then let me ask you this because you also run the bobblehead museum Yeah, so are those ones you pick up yourself?

I want to further confuse things, but the bobblehead museum and hall of fame are one and the same Okay, everybody the same collection in the museum is in fact in the hall of fame Is there a venn diagram where there are parts that are in the museum and hall of fame, but not you know I mean that's a great point. They are almost a concentric circle. Oh geez So now you mentioned three co-founders and you said you're a silent co-founder Describe the the corporate structure because you're talking so much about it right now right yeah Uh, well because I love it. It's my passion. It's my hobby.

It's my job, but you're not being silent When does the silent part start meaning?

When you started the business you were a mysterious figure who I was the money man got it So you so somebody else was the the idea person yes, okay, so this is not your idea You just provided the capital that's right so you saw the opportunity, but you didn't necessarily have the passion No, I had the passion. Oh great. I had the money and I had two friends that had a bigger bobblehead collection than I had Oh, how big was yours when you started mine was about 1,000 bobbleheads 1,000 They had 1200 bobbleheads and between them 1500 bobbleheads respectively See 2,700 bobbleheads and then it's grown we opened our museum and hall of fame Earlier this year in february. Oh, you did and we have almost 7,000 bobbleheads Wow you've and people are a specific figure you can't it's all no I can you can't almost 7,000 But specifically it's 6,969 I love it 69 69 I love that So you my five's all around so uh Where did you get all these do people send them you said or you're buying them or well I usually would get three weeks of vacation per year And I would just drive around the country buying up bobbleheads with my disposable income And what did you do for a Uh, well because of this i'm a historian, but I was an actuary in real life. Oh, okay Oh, I see an actuary You're in the insurance game and you have a lot of disposable income from that Do we want a bonus structure where the more policies you signed you got more money or i'm trying to see like were you purely on salary Can you break down Much money you answer that do you have any tax do you have any tax forms?

Any of your properties anything like that?

No, nothing like I was your finances structured was it a bonus at the end of the year?

Are you salaries in an hour a week was it an expected bonus where everyone was like, oh no We didn't get our bonuses. I don't know how I'm gonna that the further confuse things, but everything you guys mentioned Okay, great. That's what it was And in actuary like in being an actuary are you like in the business of Risk assessment risk assessment for you know people's mortality or for was it specific to industry or museums that You know might be set on fire or bubble heads that break anything that has any risk associated and money associated with Actuary comes in crunches the numbers and then it's party time About the nine after numbers are crunched and then you party and then you party can I see what's the most expensive bubble head Yeah, are there any rare valuable ones here? Uh, yeah in our museum. Yes, there are some there are extremely museum I'll take any museum most museums have expensive stuff in them scott sure But I guess bobblehead museum are limited to those well, uh, you know really technically there's only one Which is the museum and hall of fame and yeah, we have some very expensive bobble heads What's your favorite bobble head my favorite bobble head?

Sorry, but that was a water burp Okay, it was not based on anything else other than I just asked a lot about he has a vodka He has a whiskey book he has a log about So primarily I think this episode was voted into the top five due to the performance Of a man named drew tarver Mm-hmm That's normally when I pause you jump in and say oh yeah, he's good or something you have no opinion drew I love true.

What was his name? Chris gains remember and he just he wanted to do more like uh, uh, Personal music not in the country genre.

I mean, I I look like a cold tan bird right with no feathers right So something very cold, but it has just gone on a trip. Yes, just because you know, I just went on a trip because i'm Tan that's though our one piece of evidence exactly, but I took a trip away from my bandmates But my new music is it's roar It's and it's me bearing my soul.

It's not beautiful. It's urban. It's yeah. Yes. It's a field yet. Somehow urban very Trash in it. Yeah, yeah, but it is rural, but it feels urban. Yes. Yeah, but I wrote Uh, my my new song is a this is me bearing my and this is more personal music for you Even though your previous songs were seem very personal about your son being dead. Yes. No, this is very personal This is more personal than those way more person. How old was your son when he died?

He was eight years old. Oh my god. It was a big tragedy. He he wanted to write a tears in heaven type song, right?

This is this one. This is my bearing. This is you bearing your soul. So here we go hit it I'm working out at the love gym where the muscle you train is your heart Instead of punching bags they have kissing bags and the person called trainer is your wife The love gym charges a membership but instead of cash you pay with a hug love gym don't got a swimming pool instead They got a kissing room a kissing room is a room where you kiss don't understand I explained it clearly the love gym Don't have any towels you wipe your sweat with little chocolates.

There are no trappers and there are no weights All it has is a kissing room. The love gym is not a very good gym If you want to work out go to a normal gym a normal gym the love gym A bally total fitness but for love instead. Thank you Oh I'm like crying Thank you so personal. Thank you. Remember you can't trust in anyone That's the message of that song. That was the theme of that.

I maybe I didn't get it for that but Can you say you get it? No, I'm kidding. Of course. Wow Amazing. Yes, and also just it's it reminded me of some of Beyonce's music where you're really tripping over the words so quickly and There's no way I could carry okey that because it's no like clear rhythm No, yeah, and also the words would turn pink so quickly. I wouldn't know exactly Raising and rushing. Well the key to good music is to take the biggest inhale of your life and then speed through it So what what was that song based on you mentioned it was personal but uh it seemed to be about some sort of uh bally's gym with chocolates And no, that was obvious that was me. I've been dealing with Right. You're dealing with stuff. Oh, you didn't mention metaphor. You mentioned the trainer as your wife But wasn't your wife dead? Well, she was but it's a metaphor. Oh, okay. That's actually The wife is a metaphor the gym is real Yeah, it's all a metaphor Everything is a matter everything is a life. Yeah, all the fixing so it was devastating. You know my former bandmates They continue to tour as two plus two equals love that doesn't seem right. I mean it seems like you know I know it's awful and they have a new lead singer.

He said my stomach was full of love eggs The doctor prescribed me 100 kisses after that he said the eggs would hatch So he kissed my stomach 200 times and then the eggs did their Hatching dads Now my stomach is full of bugs and my heart is full of love This is inaccurate metaphor for how all people fall in love Love eggs love eggs crossing through my veins Love eggs love eggs they eating up my brain Love eggs love eggs that can't get enough Love eggs love eggs they're hatching in my gut Thank you Oh, this doctor needs to be Out it needs to be looked at definitely Well, the love eggs represent fatherington Cheshire Davies got it and the love bugs represent when those eggs hatch Was the doctor represent My You got a look of terror on your face The lyric just kind of came out.

Well, this sounds like a terrible guy Surely you haven't written a song about I have what this next song is about what it's like to be betrayed by the same The same what It's about being betrayed at the same time by the best man at your wedding and the woman who told you I do I made a reservation at the restaurant of love where they only have tables for two Instead of taking my order the way to gave me a kiss instead of food I ate perfume The love restaurant failed its recent health inspection because the kitchen is infested with rats I'm not talking love rats. These are regular rats and they're biting all the customers and staff I got food poisoning at the love restaurant pretty sure it was caused by the rats I posted a one heart review on yelp.com slash love then the business owner contacted me privately He said why'd you give my restaurant a one heart review?

Uh, like I said those are just regular those are regular rats So there were rats in your failed marriage. Yes What person Is that what led to you Breaking up? Yeah, you take inspiration from everywhere, you know, you pull from all over Chelsea what what uh what percent of what you sing about is a metaphor versus concrete and real Well, it comes and goes that person that song there was one afternoon Oh, okay, so that was all real. Yes And the and the owner of the restaurant was your wife contacting you saying That you she's a small business I was writing a song and I was doing some Yelp reviewing Okay, and it kind of bled into each other Well, that's cool because that's like making real life.

I can tell yeah, yeah, and last night I actually had um some thoughts of suicide. No, not suicide Do you call us some emergency? You said so cute.

What they could do with some of those notes. No, no, no It also if I might say is the most reminiscent of your previous work No, that's a brand new song That I wrote on the way here and it's completely original It seemed like you used the same abc sample that you did on all in your previous appearances I don't know. I don't know. I think we were all pulling over each other. We'll never know. Yeah That's what I call comedy volume 2. Oh, wait, we've already gotten into volume 2 Incredible so funny so good and one thing about those songs and Being funny is that they are is that they are but they don't just will themselves into existence. They actually are uh Those songs the lyrics are written by a couple of comedy writers two guys Hiding behind the scenes hiding not wanting any kind of a spotlight And I am going to have to drag them into the spotlight because I wanted to talk to these guys because because uh, uh, you know because we don't break the reality of Characters existence is a lot you can't be the are um, you know, they they Deserve a little more credit than sometimes during in the middle of an episode We were allowed to give them but uh, that's what we do on the best up So we wanted to have uh the guys who uh have written these songs as well as some of your other favorites On the show.
