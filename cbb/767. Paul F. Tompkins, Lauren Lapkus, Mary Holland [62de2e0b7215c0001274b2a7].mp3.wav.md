♪♪♪♪♪ No! Hey!

JK, except not.

Are you a parking ticket because I want to fight you in court? Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Wow. Yeah, that's how we do this show. Thank you to April Fool's Rebel.

That's the way we do the show.

Doo-dah, doo-dah.

That's the way we do the show.

I'll do that paper. Thanks April Fool's Rebel for that catch-raised mission.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

Boy, what an incredible week. This is the last week of July.

Can I ask you please?

Does the welcome expire at the end of the week?

Can I ask you, does the welcome see its way out when it's done?

Who are you right now?

Can I ask you, does the welcome say a deal?

Let me introduce myself. My name is Scott Ocherman. I have some special guests. Oh, yeah, please do.

My name is Peter Trenew, and I am the family board boy.

I love him!

My own show!

Oh, no!

This is Comedy Bang Bang, and I have some very special guests here.

They're pretty good. Some very extremely special guests, and they're here to promote their new podcast, Three-Dum.

This is the show that has three people on it and will never have a fourth person on it.

Three-Dum, yes, yes.

And that person, if it were to happen, certainly would not be Mary Holland.

That's the one person we've banned.

Right.

I think she's done.

No, I mean, she's not canceled. We've banned her.

Yeah, it's a personal ban. It's a personal cancel.

You can ban people you like. There's no long ago.

It actually should ban people you like. It's called boundaries.

Bandries?

Exactly, and I'm going to introduce these guys. They are my co-hosts, of course, on the other show, Three-Dum.

Please welcome to the show, The Other Paul of Tonkins and The Other Laura Mepkes.

Thank you for having me.

Hi, me too. Thank you for it.

Hi, guys. Tell me about Three-Dum. What is this show?

Three-Dum is a show that's been going on for a number of years.

It's in probably the middle of its season, whatever current season is.

Oh, it's up at the end. I don't know what the number is.

I would say, well, into the 100s.

Sure, yeah. We're in the 100s, for sure.

Yeah. And I usually describe the show.

And I usually describe, oh, you got it. Oh, so sorry. Let the man speak.

No, no. Let a man speak for once.

By the way, which was the subtitle of Three-Dum?

Let the men speak.

Let the men speak for once.

I was going to say...

No, I did it again.

Wow.

And I'm sorry, go ahead.

The way I describe this show, when people beg me to tell them what, three of them...

On their hands and knees.

On their hands and knees, of course.

Because you walk past a lot of people, you go, three of them, and then they're like, what is that?

What is it?

And I say, it's a show where the three of us tell stories from our lives, and we also act really dumb, and we play a game at the end.

That's very close to how I describe it.

Okay.

I say, it's a show where we tell stories from our personal lives.

We act really dumb, and then we play a game at the conclusion.

That's pretty different, actually.

So you think that I am dumb?

I'm a simp...

You're a sewer, you simpleton.

Simpleton.

Oh, okay.

Simpleton.

I don't know why I got that out of it.

My name is Simp Alton.

If you were to Simp for anyone, who would it be?

Um...

Coco the Gorilla.

Oh, where's the sign?

That sign-legaging faker?

That's fraud.

I don't remember what Simphing is.

What?

We're Coco Truthers on this show.

The one and only animal grifter, Coco the Gorilla.

Tell me about Simphing again, what you do if you're not.

Where are you?

It's where you...

And this is what we do on three, and by the way, we explain words to Lauren.

So, well, you know really well.

Yeah, it's like you're a fan and you're...

Are you of all people, no is this?

Yeah, no, it's essentially.

You're a simp.

No, it's essentially when you're a fan.

I forget what it means, but...

When you're a fan and you're defending them online, it's usually has a connotation to your sort of in love with them.

I think it's more...

You're in love, that's so sweet.

Where it's like, you know...

You're in love with them.

The usual response is either, hey, Simp, or she's never gonna see this, or she's never gonna fuck you.

I do.

I hope she sees this dude.

Has this replaced white knighting?

Yeah, I believe so.

I'll look up Simp.

Yeah, look it up.

Yeah, dude.

And don't just look up episodes of the Sims.

Oh, God, now I gotta restart my Google.

I know you're pretty much right.

It's a simp as someone who does way too much for a person they like.

A man who puts the hose before the bros.

A guy that is overly desperate for women, especially if she's a bad person or has expressed her dot, dot, dot, won't click it.

Well, that certainly wasn't the Urbane dictionary.

Yes.

It was urban, dicks.

Yeah, it was urban, not Urbane dicks.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, you get it out?

I love it here.

Welcome back, Lauren.

Hello, Lauren.

Lauren, Lauren, Lauren, Lauren.

It's been a long time.

It's true.

It's been a long time.

It's true.

Did you, what did you have, a baby or something?

Yeah, I did that.

We announced this on 3DAMN in a very popular segment called Lauren's TopX, which I've promoted on this show a lot.

We talked about Lauren's TopX all the time.

I hope you bring it up.

What about Paul's?

And the less popular.

Well, maybe if you promoted more.

See?

Lauren's TopX, that was so popular.

My TopX segment is so huge because I'm always bringing a lot of really important stuff to the table.

That was my biggest topic I ever had.

It's probably the one that I had the most bounce.

I think it's either that or like just talking about some shows I've been watching.

It's usually more in the reality recap segment.

Yeah, that's right.

You have a lot of stuff I have none.

You have Sims for days as a result of these segments.

Yes, I'm so glad to know what a Simp is and know that I like them.

Yeah.

And you want to encourage.

How could you not?

I love my Simsp.

Lauren loves your Simsp.

I call my fans.

I call my Simsp.

Lauren Simsp.

Love my Simsp.

So you've been gone.

You've been gone for a long time.

I've been doing a lot of podcast other than the ones that you normally do.

Do my own podcasts and it just feels like it was a lot for me to add it to the plate.

But here I am.

But here you are because we need more numbers on three to.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, you've got to get the people listening.

Yeah.

And you guys are going to love it so much.

If you please listen.

Please don't make us beg you.

You're supposed to beg us.

I'm named by my both sides.

We are your Simsp listeners.

Please.

You're not praying to God in this scene.

I am you.

Yeah.

I'm praying to the many Saints of New Jersey.

Please.

But yeah, it's just all of this.

It's like this for an hour.

Yeah.

If you want to watch.

We want people to listen to it.

Oh.

I don't want anyone to listen to it.

It's like this.

But better.

I don't want everyone to hear.

Yeah.

We do a lot of secrets from our lives.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the show because we all spill secrets.

We spill times.

We spill tea about ourselves.

We spill tea on ourselves.

We're gossiping about our own selves.

I know it's so wild.

The stuff we share.

It's so private.

It's so crazy in private.

It's like we take our face off.

Should we start at OnlyFans, the three of us?

Oh, God.

Can it be where I'm the photographer and you guys are the models?

I'm not saying no.

You can start at OnlyFans with just like random stuff.

I don't have to be the photographer.

I want to be the photographer and you're the model.

Okay.

There's had to be photography.

I don't think that's the thing.

What do you think she's proposing here?

I don't think people consider they're only fancy to be their photography.

I'm only fancy.

First wave board volley.

Here's some photography of just selfies of my tits.

It's my selfies of my teeth.

Tis selfies.

Telfies.

Right.

I have the weekends first name.

Telfie?

Telfie's.

Telfie's week.

You know what?

Oh, clue what his first name is.

Really?

Yeah, this is actually mind-blowing.

It's in the Telfie's arena.

I thought he was boring.

Is it Josh?

He was born on a Thursday.

No.

Born on a Monday, actually.

No.

It's just like something funny.

Monday's child is fair face.

Thursday's child is who he is.

Thursday's child is far to go.

Yes, that's right.

The weekend first name.

It's called Macanin test face.

What?

Able Macanin test face.

Test face.

Hey, test face.

I can't explain his whole name on you.

He looks like you on Musk.

Ew.

He's America's number one dad.

No.

Elon Musk, number one in the way of trying to make...

He's trying to have the most.

He and the America's Got Talent guy.

He has upwards of 12 children.

Yeah.

With his dick cannon.

Whoa.

Right?

He said it not me.

No, you said it.

No.

You say it.

Gaslighting.

That was our other subtitle.

Get that.

That's right.

We try to gaslight each other in every episode.

No, we don't.

What?

We do.

I'm going crazy.

So it's a great show.

People should listen to it.

And what is this show?

Well, this show...

You forgot.

I mean, it was the show where we talked to...

It was the show where we talked to interesting people.

Then it became America's podcast.

Then it became humanity's podcast.

Then I felt that that was even too limiting.

So it's humanity and the animal kingdoms podcast at this point.

So animals love it.

Yes, supposedly.

It's the number one podcast in the rainforest.

Why don't you make it the Earthlings podcast?

Because that includes animals.

No, it does.

People...

Oh, come on.

When people hear the word Earthlings, they don't think of a Jaguar.

That's not fair, though, because a Jaguar has every right to the title.

It should be Earthlings.

Don't think of how it works.

You can't change our world.

But thanks.

Like if you try every day.

If aliens came here and they saw a worm and they were like, hey, what are you doing in charge here?

Let me tell you something like this.

They were like, these Earthlings are stupid.

If I went to a different planet...

They would go to the Sears Tower.

They'd go to the...

Mount...

Hey!

Take me to you?

Are you one guy?

Hey, that'd be cool.

With four heads?

Oh, I wish we all had four heads.

Me too!

What?

We all have five heads.

That was Tyra Banks.

Tyra Banks is my head.

She used to talk about how she...

Self-admitted.

Five heads.

Yeah, self-admitted five heads.

Self-diagnosed five heads.

It's good to know the other five heads.

It is good.

So guys, what is it?

It's better than not knowing.

So Lauren, to answer your question, we have guests on this show.

Oh...

You guys are going to be sort of...

Because I'm very...

We don't have guests.

We don't have any guests.

Not Mary Holland.

No, we would never have...

Harry...

Harry Holland.

Oh, I would love to have him on.

That's what you're able to win.

Harry Holland?

He's great.

Beautiful singing voice.

Holland Ackermann is a stepbrother.

Harry Holland.

That's right.

Harry...

Holland Ackermann.

So we have guests on this show...

And we talk to them.

You guys are going to be sort of my erstots co-hosts on this...

Ew.

Yeah.

Erstots.

Yes, you are.

I looked it up in the Urbain Dictionary.

Ooh.

So you guys are...

We're going to talk to these people as they come in one by one.

And we're going to just ask them about their lives.

I don't think I met any of these.

No, I haven't met any of these.

I haven't met on the show in a while either.

Are the people still interesting?

The ones you're building.

I don't know.

Honestly, they've gotten worse and worse.

You still have big stars, right?

That's why you stopped saying interesting people.

They all migrated over to the other company that sprang and sprung out of here.

Mmm.

I want to know more.

Don't come on around here anymore.

Okay, Tom Petty.

That's it.

Ahh!

We're having fun!

We are having fun!

Oh, wow!

Tom Petty was a singer.

You know what actually cried yesterday?

I think he let he died.

Oh, no!

Really?

Did you always think about him?

I was thinking, I thought, listen to how much fun he's having and what he did for us.

And he gave all of us these songs.

He was like Jesus of music.

I cried a little bit of my car.

If Jesus had been a musician...

It wasn't that little bad.

You think Jesus couldn't have picked up a guitar and gave us a little dispatch?

For what?

Do you know, here's what I was thinking about musical instruments the other day.

Uh-huh.

That once you make one, you create a musical instrument, it just stays around.

Like the guitar, I mean, it doesn't disintegrate.

The ukulele.

Well, they don't say, well, we have the guitar, we can get rid of the ukulele.

Or it's extinct.

Yeah.

We don't need the mandolin anymore because we have a banjo now.

It is.

They hit them all.

No, it's like cars, they get rid of older models of cars.

But they shouldn't.

No.

Every car that ever was made should still be on the Earth Day.

The Model B!

I wanted to drive it.

It should be an Earthling.

A Model B.

Model B.

I wanted to have Model A.

The Model D cup.

Did they sign up for tea?

They didn't get a, to like, to you?

What?

They didn't give it to me.

Yeah, they never.

They never gave it to me.

I was like, well, I wasn't that special.

We're not getting swag.

That's the reason we're promoting three items.

We want more time.

Here's why we're promoting it.

We're coming back with a new episode every Thursday.

That's right.

Until November and then we stop for a while.

That's right.

No until September.

That was sooner.

Yes, September.

This is a late season check-in.

This is a very late season.

I want to alert everyone that we have a new episode every week and we have for years except for sometimes where we didn't.

We had a pretty late season check-in with the boys recently with Jack Quays.

Jack Quays?

Jack Quays.

Jack Quays, Neil.

Jack Quays.

Get it right.

It's Jack-Ease, by the way.

Jack-Ease?

Yeah, it's Jack-Ease.

Jada Kiss.

Excuse me.

Jada Kiss, Neil.

So I wanted to have a late season check-in for a three-dom and I'm so glad you guys came.

But we are going to get to our first guest.

Oh, this is exciting.

We are the Arizona's co-host.

Yeah, so this is going to feel weirder than it did on three-dom.

It is in a tear.

Yeah.

This is going to feel strange.

Well, what do I do or save?

I don't know.

I'll figure it out.

We'll figure it out.

Okay, let's bring on our first guest.

Is it cool that I ate a bunch of pills?

It's a cool that I ate.

Oh, wait.

It sounded like a song that I was trying to remember.

It's a cool that I ate.

We're coming in chips.

Sure.

It's okay.

Is that okay?

All that aside, I was going to sell for money.

I actually had garlic, urban butter chips in the way here from.

Garlic, urban butter.

What is it?

Urban.

There are Japanese chips.

Since you went to Japan, you only eat Japanese food.

I went to Tokyo the other day and I got lots of stuff.

Just go to the big one.

Just go to the big one and bring it up to you.

I can't deal with that because of COVID.

Also, the Prime Minister.

I know.

Former.

Was it a news show?

Oh, we do update the news.

So we let me talk about every bad thing that happened two weeks ago just to get everyone in the mood for what's going to happen next.

Let me say this, and this is probably unpopular, but when a former Prime Minister gets shot, I guess I don't care that much.

That is unpopular.

Okay.

AITA.

Let us bring her on.

She is a local reporter, local.

Local to where I wonder.

Well, I can't guess.

I guess if I were to say local reporter, it would imply local to here.

But perhaps she is.

Well, you're the one saying it.

So that's what I thought you meant.

Well, this is...

Standless Hollywood.

No, two, one, oh.

Possibly.

30 years.

Clap, clap, baby.

Let's bring her on.

She's a local reporter.

Nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh.

Please welcome, for the first time on the show, Haney Delf.

Hi.

I'm says I just got hit by a car.

Oh, no.

I just got hit by a car.

I'm okay.

I think you don't need to do the podcast.

Yeah, you need to get it on the hostel.

No, no, no.

I'm okay.

I'm gonna shut down.

I'm gonna shut this down.

No, no, no.

I'm turning up the lights.

I'm gonna fold my arms.

I got hit by a car in college too.

No, I get...

Oh, wait.

Were you saying you got hit by a car just now?

Yeah, just right on my way.

What happened?

Well, I was standing behind a car and it slowly backed up and I just got hit by it.

Oh, oh.

Like a little tap.

Well, it did.

It rolled over me just a little bit.

What?

I'm okay.

It seems like you were letting it happen.

Well, I'm okay.

You know, I'd be...

Is this...

What?

Is this...

My skin?

Oh, God.

I know that someone else is...

Oh, God.

I'm so...

There's some tire tread in there.

My skin get on you.

Wow.

That's so wild.

I don't know.

She's fluffed it around.

Oh, my God.

You're really hurt.

No, no, no.

I don't know.

And you're an A-block.

You gotta stay through B-block, C-block.

Yeah.

Oh.

This is too long for you to be on a show.

We should shut down.

Oh, no, please don't shut down.

I've been...

No, I've been wanting to come on here for so long.

Let her go before the tag.

Oh, please.

Okay.

Hey, well, hey, sweetie.

What's your job?

Hey, honey.

Hey.

Tell us about what your job is.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, well, I'm a local reporter.

I do weather reports.

I do reports on bake sales and other events and going on.

Do you do that here in Los Angeles?

No, I do it locally.

Oh, okay.

I do it locally in Vietnam.

Oh, but where?

So where?

You west of Virginia.

Oh, local to your where you live.

Yeah, that's right.

Your neck of the woods, as they say.

My neck of the woods.

Okay.

Bake sales don't really happen here.

I'll be honest.

I'd love for you to bake cuz some stuff, sweetie.

I'm happy.

So, hey, her name's sweetie.

It's not my name.

Okay.

Tell me that again.

I'll kill you.

Hey, princess.

I mean, do you not feel, I feel like we can almost see bone on your thoughts.

Yeah, no.

Oh, no.

That's the bone in your neck.

Oh, thank you.

And a bone in your nose?

Beautiful, clavicle.

Oh, that's so good.

What is that jewelry you're wearing?

Oh, you know, I wasn't sure if I could pull this off.

No, no, no, no, I can't.

It's like a Halloween bone.

Yeah, like a flint stone sheet.

I wanted to dress up because I'm such a big simp of y'all.

Oh, thank you so, it's so nice to be one of our heroes.

That's right.

Have you heard of Three-Dome?

Oh, yeah.

The show where we don't have Mary Hollend on?

Oh, yeah.

And that's my favorite part about it.

Cuz she's a fucking...

Whoa, she's a great friend.

She's a great friend.

Yeah, we just don't want her on our show.

We just, she's a personal friend.

Oh, I can't ask you a question about your family.

What's your name?

Good move.

I'm a first dif.

You know, I've been wondering the same thing.

I've been digging into my dill for so long.

You know, a lot of our last names have to do with what our ancestors used to do, you know, their job or their, so maybe your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grandfather was a dad that someone wanted to fuck.

And he was.

Because here I am.

They liked it.

Yeah.

They enjoyed it.

Like your great, great, great, great, grandfather, I guess he awkward?

Yeah, I think so.

He was a man who awkward.

He said that it's not dad I like to fuck.

It's dad I would like to fuck.

Dad I'd like to fuck.

I'd like to fuck.

You know, you just corrected us and we're wrong.

I did say well, I was saying I would.

It's a contraction.

You're getting it.

I just want to point that out.

Like, I was wrong.

I was wrong.

You're wrong.

Yeah.

That's you.

Ms. Delf, this is us.

Oh boy.

This is what I came for.

I tell you what.

I tell you what's the weather like.

It's so good.

Maybe she hasn't prepared a report.

It's so good today.

All you got to do is look out there and it's fun.

It's fun.

Wait, look out here because this is not local to you.

No, no.

Look out there.

I'm on a trip.

I'm on a, you know, because I'm not in West Virginia right now.

I'm on a trip.

What are you doing out here?

I'm always on a trip.

I always wanted to see Los Angeles Beverly Hills.

What do you think of it?

From Weezer.

Yeah, you heard the Weezer song and you were like, I got it.

That's exactly what I wanted to get.

I got it.

Give me lady.

Oh my gosh.

I do cut it by a cart.

Yeah, I know.

Your forehead is started to bleed.

I feel like we're not talking about that enough.

Well, you know, but it's no big deal because I got hit by car in college.

I got hit by car.

You know, I'm okay to have it happen a lot of times, you know.

When I was a little girl, got hit by car.

Really?

How little?

One.

One year old.

So you guys remember it.

I was crossing the street alone.

Why?

Were you on that show?

I was.

I was crossing the street.

I was going to the pigly-wiggly to get some, some bugles from a mama.

Does she fit them on her fingers and then one by one?

Yeah.

She used to pretend that she was an old witch.

That's scary.

You look at me some witch.

Was she an old witch, by the way?

She wasn't a witch.

Yeah.

The deals are witches from long past.

What?

Wow.

And you chose a different path.

I did.

I said, I want to do local report and I want to take people up on them.

But you know, it's sort of, I think being a local celebrity is amazing because people just, they see you every day.

Are you a celebrity or are you infamous?

I'm infamous.

Really?

Why?

I'm infamous.

Famus?

Yeah, or infamous.

Well, now what's the difference?

You know what?

Never knew.

The famous is like, oh, wow, everyone knows you and infamous is like everyone knows you for a bad conversation.

And then, famus is like people don't know you but they think they know you.

Yeah.

And please take this any bear.

Famus.

Do you want this, by the way?

It's so much.

Every guest on comedy band, baby.

Well, it's, well, on freedom slash com.

Yeah.

Every guest on freedom, if there were to be guests on freedom, would get one of these two years.

Well, they get, they get this.

This is one.

You get to have it for a week and kind of you write about it's, it's journey in the notebook.

Yes.

And then pass it out.

You take a picture.

Please don't forget to do this.

Please.

And don't just cram it at the end and pretend it all happened on different days.

Yeah.

You can tell.

Oh, am I sending this back to you or?

Yes.

There's a, oh, I guess we did.

Yes.

I guess we did.

You send it back to us.

What do you think you pay for the postage?

We pay for the postage.

We don't pay for the postage.

No, you pay for the postage.

I pay for the postage.

Yes.

I can tell.

I can't.

I have a camera.

It's made of heavy glass.

It's filled with ball bearings and a camera and beans and a camera and beans.

Yeah.

Do you smell toast?

No, you are severely injured.

No.

Yeah.

I'm okay.

Wait, no, I am, I am making some toast.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

My mid afternoon snack.

Oh, crazy.

Because I was making some toast too.

My butt pop.

Oh my God.

It's perfectly buttered.

But.

Right.

Wait a minute.

Oh no, it's just a cop across the elite.

A cop?

I was like, oh man, who made toast with my bacon?

No.

He's probably here.

He's investigating the...

Oh, so it just happened right outside.

Yeah, just happened right outside.

The cop outside is actually here turning the investigate.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

Well, anyway, but I'm okay.

You're all right?

Yeah, I'm okay.

Hey, me.

You look like your eyes swapped sockets.

Thank you.

You're looking off into different directions.

I'm so good.

I mean, well, I guess he didn't slowly back.

I guess it was a full-on like...

A full-on like...

Full speed.

Who's going backwards at full speed?

But, dude, it seems like you might have known the person.

Oh no, I don't know anyone out here.

I don't know anyone.

But in Bulltown, I know you and you got me this teddy bear.

Why were you behind this car?

Yeah, what were you doing there?

Why be behind it?

You're not saying it was your fault.

Who goes behind a car?

I just don't understand.

Well, I want to see...

Look, in West Virginia, you know, I know...

I didn't know this mountain mama.

No, he did want that.

I was rocking my brain as fast as I could.

It felt like something.

I know all the people there.

I know what people have in their cars.

I don't know what people...

You know, my mama always said the best way to get to know somebody is look what's in their caboose.

Wow, when people have trash...

You're a part of what she's talking about a car.

No, people have trash in their car.

It's a sign about the person.

They want to turn on their cars.

And when their car is full of toys, it means they'll have to play.

So you were looking at this person's possessions in the back of their car?

I didn't know.

I don't know if they possessed it or not.

I was just looking through the back wheel.

The possession is nine tenths of the law, wouldn't you agree?

Absolutely, Ron.

We always agree on this.

Yes, sir!

It is true, though.

When I look at somebody's car, I have no proof that they possessed these things.

That's true.

Somebody could have put them in there.

No, it's such a good point.

So anyway, I was standing back there and I was looking through.

I was looking through the winch.

I was just trying to say, but it was tinted.

So I couldn't quite see inside.

It was a tinted?

No.

Yeah, there was a whole encampment tent.

No, like a Coleman.

Oh, sure.

What?

Really?

Are you sure it wasn't a car cover?

It's like, it's like Kleenex.

Oh, Kleenex.

I go, Xerox Kleenex.

Oh, I had a car.

Xerox Kleenex.

I had a Coleman.

Xerox Kleenex.

Coleman.

Xerox Kleenex.

Coleman.

Xerox Kleenex.

Coleman.

Am I part of freedom now?

No, no.

Well, I mean, number one we won't have on is Mary Hall.

Of course.

She said, you can say it.

You kind of remind me of her, but it's like maybe that's why you think she's a bitch.

Yeah, because we hate the things we see in the mirror.

You kind of remind me of her.

Yeah.

She also wears a sweater that has like a tire tread pattern.

And so that's making me think of her.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, gosh.

Well, what a coincidence.

I mean, I, you know, this I just got today that these tracks I just got today.

So I would never buy us.

You're not Mary Hall.

Are you?

What?

No.

Okay.

I just went.

No, that's so rude.

Cause she's from, I feel like she's from West Virginia because.

She's from Virginia, Southwest Virginia.

Very close.

Right, right.

I've heard.

Because I had a newspaper from her home town.

You would have heard that because you're from West Virginia.

I had a newspaper from her home town that her picture was in for approximately two years on my nightstand thinking, I'll give this to Mary at some point.

And then finally I was like, did you have that?

Cause I was in Virginia.

I stand.

He read it every night.

I was literally just like, yeah, read it.

I was like, I'll put this somewhere where I'll make sure I remember.

Make sure I remember it.

And then two years, two years later, I was like, Mary, I have had this newspaper for two years.

And she said, Oh, I already have one.

Of course.

Well, I'm sure you were going to scoop her family.

Yeah.

Right.

Well, I just wanted to come on in because I'm such a little girl.

And I just wanted to hear like, what if you could name for me like now that you brought her up?

Like, what is it about Mary Hall and that you're like, um, Hey, that's no good.

Well, I mean, she's not, she's not one of the three of us.

Yes.

The show is Scott.

Let me take off these coal, these pieces of coal, this carrot.

Hey, that's my nose!

I'll grab with them blood painters.

Wait a minute.

Oh my God, that's...

It's Mary Holland!

Why'd you put your thumb in her butt hole?

I'm taking a hella.

Ow, Scott!

That really hurts.

Oh my God, Mary.

Sorry, don't...

Oh wait, you actually did get hit?

Yes.

Oh no.

So wait, all those wounds and the tire track is on.

Yes!

Oh my God!

Oh no!

Your thumb is still in my butt!

Oh no!

Oh, there he goes.

Oh, it's bloody.
