♪♪♪ Evening, cheating, unless you're fasting.

I'm looking at you, Gandhi.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Uh-huh.

Thank you to Pugsley's Chicken.

Pugsley's Chicken.

Let's see the avatar.

No, it's just a normal person, not Pugsley himself, from the Adams Family franchise.

But speaking of the Adams family, oh, God, I have no segue.

I usually start those segues and it usually works out in my mind, but this one did not.

Welcome to the show, though.

My name is Scott Ockermann.

We have a great episode of Comedy Bang Bang for you today.

A little bit later, we have a diarist.

Uh, and we also have a travel guide, and that's exciting.

Uh, and, um, we're in the middle of, uh, September, and I gotta say, celebs are back.

The backyard era, we had no one, no one wanted to come to the backyard, but last week we have Adam Scott, and now this guy, a contemporary of Adam Scott, who is perhaps a klipscomb in both TV and film.

Oh, wow.

Although Adam is nominated for one of those little Emmys.

Yes, Emmy.

You can't spell me without Emmy.

That's right.

Um, because you have one, and I was there.

I was there backstage when you were left.

Oh, man, remember those days?

That golden, what is that?

Nugget.

Is it a woman?

It's a, it's a figure.

It's a winged figure.

And by the way, the Emmys are tonight.

Do you get, do you get, uh, winged figure, holding a golden globe?

Yeah, interesting because the golden globes, which we cannot talk about.

No, you're not allowed, but you, uh, you won one of those.

Two of them.

Yeah, that's right.

And you weren't allowed to do your speech.

I wasn't allowed to give him back.

I don't know.

There was so many things that I'm not allowed to do.

Leave him on the porch.

Nope.

No, no one will take him.

The Hollywood press association.

You're like, no, these are worthless.

Uh, too bad, but, uh, he is, of course, uh, you know him as Donnie D from mad, the mad man and, uh, as, uh, he's in theaters now as Admiral Shitbird in, uh, Top Gun, never.

Wow.

It's so good to be back.

Just saw you again on, uh, Saturday.

I watched the movie a second time.

I was just like, you're really playing an unlikable guy.

Well, an antagonist.

I suppose there are no real bad guys in the, in the movie.

No, he thinks he's a good guy, right?

He's, he's protecting the, the taxpayers' investments.

Thank you very much.

But every single person in the movie seems to know he's a bad guy.

Uh, John Hamm is here.

Our old friend, celebs are back.

Hey!

On comedy bang bang.

Gotta be back back.

Um, you, you are, uh, in the movie Top Gun Maverick.

You, you have that, uh, wonderful thing that everyone gets to do in the top, or, uh, in the Tom Cruise movies where you say Tom Cruise's character name in disbelief.

Oh, Maverick.

Maverick.

Because like, you, you, this ego has been writing checks his body can't cut.

He's been writing checks his body can't cash for well over 30 some odd years.

I think it's his butt can't cash him as far as I'm concerned.

Well, I'm pretty sure they were successfully cashed.

Yeah, I don't know.

He's been wrong this time.

Yeah, but did cash those checks?

I don't know.

He has a really nice motorcycle.

He's never been overdrawn.

Yeah.

As far as I can tell.

Um, that, was that fun to it now?

I talked to you about that back when we were doing the, the Between Two Ferns movie back in God 2018 or something like that.

Yeah, so we started shooting that movie in 2018.

And then we finished it in 2019 and it was meant to come out in 2020.

And then the pandemic.

Scammed him.

Pan's Demick.

Uh, the labyrinth led right to the Demick and then it was a rough thing.

Yes.

But then it comes out in what yours is now 2022.

It comes out this year.

The Double Deuce.

That's right.

And it is a, and by the way, your character does take two shits in the movie.

Is that right?

Yes.

He says, excuse me twice in the movie.

I'm like, this guy is taking a shit.

Is he really?

I haven't really seen that in movies a lot.

They call it the name.

They call that Hidden Head.

Where one of the characters just goes, uh, excited.

Yeah, you go.

Why wouldn't they come out?

And everyone looks to themselves like, where's this guy going?

And then just a lot of noise and then right back into the scene.

Sorry guys.

Yep.

Oh, you know what?

One more time.

Maverick.

But it comes out this year.

Here he goes taking shits.

Your body can't catch.

Comes out this year as a smash hit.

Smash.

It really, you know.

They're more than the television show smash.

That's right.

Yeah.

Smashier.

What was the musical that they were doing in smash?

It was called Top Gun Maverick.

Weirdly.

What if that movie becomes a musical?

I would definitely go see that.

Would you go, would you start in it?

For sure.

Yeah.

The dancing cyclone, or you'd have that, that writes itself.

Of course.

And you, and I'm sure your character would have like a King George and Hamilton style solo where he's playing.

And I spin a lot and then I immediately take a shit over to you.

Double deuce.

I'm off.

But that's, so you've filmed that before the pandemic and then you, you, you have a new movie coming out this Friday in theaters as well as streaming online.

It's called Confess Fletch.

Yes.

And when did you do this?

No, we shot, we shot this movie during the pandemic.

Oh, really?

Uncoffing?

Everyone's coughing.

Really sick, sweaty, uncomfortable and masked.

So it's really hard to see who's who, but it's.

Everyone sounds, everyone sounds like Bane.

Oh, hello, Flats.

What's going on?

Flats.

We really need Doug for that.

I, yeah, no, it was, we shot it in Boston in the summer of 2021.

Being town is what they call it.

They call it being town.

Everybody's full of beans and running around going to college.

Um, so we, we, we shot that.

It is the continuation of the character that one, Cheddar Cheese made.

That's right.

I think you say that right.

Made famous in the 80s.

But the, the, M Fletcher, the Fletch books, that movie, a lot of people don't even know the Fletch movies that Cheddar Cheese made were based on books.

On novels that are written by a guy named Gregory McDonald, who himself was an investigative reporter for the Boston Globe.

That's right.

And then Chevy very famously made it.

He broke the spotlight case, didn't he?

And they weirdly didn't make Fletch about that.

Yeah, it was, it was not as funny.

Differently funny, differently funny.

Sorry.

Uh, but no, uh, yeah.

So, uh, Chevy, Chevy, uh, Cheddar, Cheddar, Charvam, Char, Chevrolet.

Yes, Chevy, Chevy, Chevy, Chevy, Charvam.

Made, uh, made a very funny movie in the 80s about it.

But it wasn't really kind of a radical departure.

His movie, yeah.

The 80s, very slapstick, and what we decided to do myself in the wonderful director, Greg Matola, um, decided to kind of go back to these original books and, and, and, and, and kind of hue more closely to the source material.

And that's what we did.

And we sort of made a very new version of it, um, that we hope is, uh, is equally funny or differently funny or as funny or more funny.

And, uh, but you are keeping the scene where you get the big afro and you dress up like the letters.

Oh, yeah.

That, that, that, and the people forget about this from the second movie, the, the dancing plantation scene, uh, work.

So we keep a lot of the, uh, baked in races.

That's for the fans.

Yeah.

That's your fan service.

Yeah, of course.

Really.

So, uh, so no, we, uh, we took a little different approach with a lot of the, uh, uh, well, I, I used to read, I used to read these books when I was, uh, younger.

And I, in fact, I think I, I, I believe I was in the running to write one of these movies really 20 years ago or so.

Yeah.

They've been trying to make it for, as you say, decades and, you know, various and sundry people have been, uh, sedacous, I think, uh, Ryan Reynolds, maybe they can half-lack or two, um, because they're both afflic switching off scenes.

That would be amazing.

He's flitched so much shorter in this scene.

Um, and spankier.

Um, I'm not sure which one you're talking about.

Uh, where it just works.

I haven't, I haven't sized both of them up side by side.

So yeah.

Uh, and I think Kevin Smith might have been attached to maybe directed at some point.

That's right.

Kevin Smith is a huge fan of these books.

I'm trying to get these.

And so like, like you, I too read all of these books and was sort of like, oh, the, the, the movie's nothing like the books at all.

Yeah.

It's so different.

It's such a funny character, but not funny in the cheddar cheese way.

Not like the cheese and wigs and funny voices and funny names.

He's just a funny, like sort of self-effacing guy.

Yes.

And, and a little more sophisticated and what have you, but, but it was, it was really fun to make.

We got, uh, John Slattery, uh, to play my, my former boss, uh, who people might remember for the first, from the first film of the mad men, the, of the mad men.

Yeah.

Uh, so again, playing my boss, uh, he's playing your boss in this and he plays Frank.

Did he ever, did he ever was he like, look, Draper in the scenes and you're like, Oh, sorry, I'm flexing this one.

Yeah, no, it was.

Yeah.

Come on, man.

Uh, no, but it was really, it was really fun.

I think his scenes were like some of the first scenes we shot.

And so it was super fun and, and you should just, the two of you should do every project together.

I wouldn't mind it.

Yeah, I shot, uh, right after we finished Fletch, I went off to do a John's movie that he directed called Maggie Boren with me and Tina Fey.

We shot it in, uh, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

So I, I love working with him.

And that was a big part of it.

And, uh, we got him.

We got Roy, Roy Wood Jr.

Who played former guest on the show.

Yes.

Uh, friend of the show, I'm sure, um, uh, who plays this sort of a person who's trying to test with solving, uh, this murder along with myself, uh, the lovely intelligent Marcia Gay Harden, up and coming comedic starlet, Aidan Mayari from, um, I love that for you.

Okay.

I don't know if you've seen that.

Uh, I love that.

Uh, I have not seen it yet, but, uh, huge fans.

Everybody's funny in that.

Yeah.

And, uh, yeah, and Kyle Ablopman just tells you in general, well, the arts and the craft.

Yeah, sure.

I love arts and crafts.

Those are two of my favorite things.

Arts, craft, three of my favorite things, arts, crafts and ampersands.

That's right.

Yes.

And arts and crafts covers of all right there.

Yeah.

Uh, so yeah.

And, and, uh, and, uh, right, Matilda, by the way, people will remember he did adventure land and super cops.

What is it?

Super bad.

And, uh, uh, the interpreters.

Yes.

Uh, along with a little movie called Keeping Up With The Joneses.

That's right.

Which I saw on a winged thing flying in the air.

Well, did it, did it move you?

The plane.

Not the movie.

Yeah.

No, no, I made it.

That's what we were hoping.

We were hoping people see that in planes.

Had enough time to watch that and eat a meal.

We forget it.

Uh, I thought it was, I thought it was fun.

I remember like you in a car in Gal Gadot and she's shooting something.

Yes.

It was a very action oriented company.

It was very fun.

It was before Gal Gadot was, uh, one of the women.

I thought it was a good dot.

It might be.

You know what?

Does she ever correct anyone on that?

She never corrected me.

Because we always call her Gadot on the Ferns movie and she just like nodded.

I mean, she's, she's game.

Sure.

Game good.

Sure.

Um, so yeah.

So, uh, yes, we had a blast making it and, uh, and hopefully cause as you know, there are many, many more novels to be, uh, to be, um, uh, I would love to see 27 of these movies.

I would love to make 26 of them.

And then the 27th I would do just out of spite.

Sure.

Well, this is great.

Confess, Fletch.

Is that how you say it is?

Or is it confess, Fletch?

I think you can really take whatever inflection you'd like to do.

In Fletch.

That's a great thing about title.

In Fletch.

Thank you.

Yes.

Thank you very much.

Confess, Fletch.

But that's the thing about titles is.

Confess, Fletch.

Mm-hmm.

Well, there is a comma in the actual title.

So, confess, comma, Fletch.

Comma, Fletch.

Yes.

Okay.

That's the good thing about titles you can say them however you want, right?

Yes.

Exactly.

You don't have, you can say Fletch, confess.

Yeah, exactly.

No one's going to stop you, right?

Cheddar cheese.

Right, exactly.

Wait, is Cheddar in this movie?

Cheddar is not.

We didn't want it to be the kind of thing where...

The thing that he was in.

That he was in.

We didn't want the kind of weird nostalgic thing of oh, there's the guy, the weird cameo.

Well, it's been at this point now 40 years.

Yes.

We're closing on to 40 years.

I always thought, you know, even in the like the Ghostbusters thing when the Dan Aykroyd is an old timey cabbie somehow, why is this happening?

Right.

I don't think...

Although if Dan Aykroyd were an old timey cabbie in this...

It would, it would be great.

Yeah, exactly.

Boston is full of old timey, just characters.

Old timey cranky cabbies.

Get in the car, yo!

We're going to Alston.

Well, I think this is good.

I think it's a good way to just totally start fresh be, because these books are great.

You're great.

Greg Matala is great.

The just film in general.

And the arts and comedy slash drama with those masks with the one half is the sad guy and the other half is...

Golden Globes, these things are all great.

Yeah, they're all great.

But we realize too that, you know, there's generations of movie goers and people that have no connection to...

Why would you ever watch that first flatch ever?

Like if you were 20 years old.

It doesn't make sense.

It doesn't make any sense.

It doesn't make sense.

You know what it means?

Oh, okay.

You know what?

I like all these people.

Exactly.

Let's make more of these and let's make 26 more of these.

Yeah.

What's the next book called?

Because this is the first one in the series.

You can kind of jump around.

There's Fletch's Fortune, there's Fletch in the widow Bradley, there's Karaoke Fletch.

What's the one you really want to do?

Jai Narrow.

You want to go to Rio?

Is that what I'm hearing?

Right.

Who doesn't?

I've bladed on Rio for years.

Have you ever seen Blame it on Rio?

Yes.

Weird movie.

Very weird movie.

Deeply problematic.

Very straight.

Just a little bit.

It seems like in the 80s, like screenwriters in general, all these like old men who are like 45 or 50 suddenly realized like...

So old.

Like...

Suddenly realized they didn't have to stay married to their wives anymore.

No, they did not.

And like, you know, the whole paradigm of like, you got to stay together.

You can't get divorced.

Suddenly that blows up and they're...

Or let me pitch this, Jim, or you could on vacation, fuck the 18 year old daughter of your best friend.

Right.

And by the way...

Repeatedly.

Demi Moore, I think she's 18 in the movie, but the other one is 17.

17, yes.

And special dispensation to appear nude in the movie.

A judge had to sign a piece of paper that allowed her to make...

Who was this judge?

Oh, Judge naked Mickey.

He was the guy you go to.

Of course.

The Hollywood guy.

Of course.

That...

Also, I don't think we're spoiling anything by revealing these delicate plot twists.

But this movie is 40 years old this year, I believe.

The third act reveal where it is revealed that Joseph Polonia is also fucking Michael King's wife.

I know.

It's crazy.

What is happening here?

It's like, hey, couldn't we fuck everybody?

I'm going to write a movie about this.

I mean, you can blame it on real, but I think maybe you should really look in the mirror, both of you.

Because wasn't it the dude for mash, didn't he write it?

Like, there he held by.

Yeah, there he held by.

I think you're correct.

Yeah, it's insane.

There was a time in the late 70s, early 80s, maybe a 10 year span where it just all bets were off.

It doesn't matter how...

And people would go...

Do you remember the line from the Woody Allen?

Annie Hall, where the Tony Roberts is picking him up from the airport?

Annie, I love you.

That one.

He's Tony Roberts is picking Woody Allen up and he's perturbed that he had to pick him up because he was busy having sex with two 16 year old girls.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

That is a line in a movie.

That's it.

And he repeatedly references it.

Like, you made...

Yeah.

16.

You son of a...

To be fair, that's a 32 year old.

Very true.

Yeah.

So, a weird guy, Woody Allen.

Is that what you're trying to say?

I guess I'm trying to say...

I guess I'm trying to say there's probably some things to unpack there.

Well, ConfessFletch is in theaters this Friday.

It's also streaming you get it on...

It's a team, Apple.

And you're streaming platforms.

Yeah.

And streaming services.

Maybe your phone?

I don't know.

The new Woody Allen.

Anything that streams.

The new Woody Allen.

John Hamm.

Thank you.

Thanks very much.

I will proudly accept.

So, maybe there's room.

This is great.

ConfessFletch.

I'm going to be first in line to watch this.

Online or in line?

I'm going to be first online.

Yeah.

In line online.

When everyone turns on their computers in the morning.

First.

I'm going to be right there first.

Type picture.

You type it in first.

Like in a old timey comment section.

First.

We need to take a...

Ooh, I stuttered on to take.

I mean, we need to...

I'm so frightened right now.

Doing Woody Allen is something I'm going to take.

Annie, I love you though.

This is the Woody Allen that no one does.

Max.

But Annie, you know, I'm in love with you.

You know, the gentle when he's trying to cajole.

16 year old twins, Max.

I know, but Annie, you know what I mean.

Max.

Let's go get some health food at the source.

They're always playing bracket ball too, aren't they?

I was big in the 70s when you weren't.

Anyway.

We're going to take a break.

When we come back, we have a diarist.

We also have a travel guide.

Are you excited about the show?

Both of those things are things that I enjoy.

I don't think you've been on since the 10th anniversary.

Is that true?

I don't think I've spent a minute.

Yeah, so...

In a minute, yes, I believe the 10th anniversary was my line last, my ultimate appearance.

So obviously the show is a fallen off.

Yeah, the worst without me.

We have a diarist and a travel guide coming up.

So usually it would be three celebrities on these types of shows.

Listen, they may be celebrities in their own world.

True.

This could be a very famous diarist.

I don't know.

We don't know.

I've not met said diorista.

And I have not looked at the name of the diarist.

You think as a diarista, like a barista with diarrhea?

I think so.

Yeah.

And usually all that coffee would give you diarrhea.

100%.

Wouldn't it?

Yeah, that sounds like the old double deuce.

Alright.

We'll ask them about this.

Now, excuse me, I have to go.

Scott, clap, clap, clap.

Short, shut, flush.

I'm back.

Alright, we'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang More John Hamm after this.

Comedy Bang Bang More John Hamm of Confess Fletch is in theaters.

How many?

And streaming.

How many theaters are you doing?

I think it's something like a 400 theater.

That's a pretty good.

Nice release.

It's in theaters across the country, including my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri.

Really?

I was just in there.

St. Louis.

Yeah, we did a show there on the tour.

Yeah.

What theater did you perform?

It's a good question.

Was it the pajeón?

The pajeón?

No, it was the stiffle.

Are you just making it worse?

Stuyvesant, Starven, Chevrolet.

It was...

The magic mic.

The pageant.

Yes.

I thought about texting you to see if you were in town.

And then I thought, of course he's done.

No, he doesn't live here anymore.

He's very rarely here.

But I see there...

How was the show?

Was it received well?

Yeah, I thought that I don't know I've ever been there before.

I thought it was great.

Yeah, we saw those big arches.

It was fun.

Yeah, it's one arch.

Oh, yeah, that's right.

Yeah.

The other one is a fast restaurant.

I was at McDonald's.

Yeah, you're right.

There used to be a floating McDonald's down on the river.

Really?

On a riverboat, a riverboat, McDonald's.

Do you have to take a riverboat to get to it?

No, it was permanently moored.

But now they have stuck casinos down there.

So it's...

Could you do a drive-through in it though?

Maybe with a car?

No, with a boat.

Oh, okay.

That'd be kind of awesome.

Don't I see you though in like St. Louis games, you're always like popping up.

You're like, singing, take me out to the ballgame and stuff like that.

Something like that.

Yeah, I do have family back in St. Louis and I do go back on occasion.

But I haven't been back in sometimes.

It's not the most, as you probably found out, it's not the best place to be in the summer.

It's a little warm.

Right, yeah, it was a little warm.

Yeah.

Although I do have on the St. Louis Walk of Fame, I have a star on the St. Louis Walk.

Oh, congratulations.

Yes, I was very...

Who else is there?

Just me.

Just you.

I'm not even Ellie Kemper.

No.

You're former student.

No, not yet.

Just me.

Interesting.

And the star is as big as the arch.

Oh, really?

And it takes up the entire street.

It's actually right down the street from the pageant.

That's why I mentioned it.

Oh.

Maybe on your way walking to the show with...

I did not see it.

No.

Did you want to see it?

I actually would like to see it.

You know our good friend, Tal John, he has a star on the Palm Springs.

Yes, I know.

I know.

That's what reminded me of that.

Now you of course, people would know you most famously from being...

With this show.

Connor Ratliff, scene partner from the University of Missouri Production of Ordinary People.

Yes, that's where I get a lot of people on the street being like, you know what?

I saw that production in 1992.

I just had to fit that in because I was talking to him and he mentioned that.

I took over for it because it was in the...

It was a holdover show from the Summer Repertory Theater that we did.

And I took over for the guy that played it in the Summer and we started it anew with a different cast, Me, for the fall for the show.

So they have something up and running so people can go to the theater.

And I was so nervous that I wasn't going to know my lines.

I had to skip the first two rehearsals because I lost my voice.

Really?

So you were that nervous?

I literally had my...

Can't talk.

I was like, but any I love you, I can't talk.

So I was pretty tired.

So how did it go off?

I eventually recovered my voice and knew all my lines and had an amazing time working with Connor who I then of course ran into many, many, many years ago after.

And it was an amazing journey that he's had that whole...

Yeah, were you on Dead Eyes?

Dead Eyes.

Yes, I was the one that I think enabled the...

The Tom...

Really?

You did that?

I mean, I didn't do it alone, but I was...

Sure.

It takes a village, obviously.

It takes many...

It takes both thanks without hangs.

Yeah.

You guys, I've never seen ordinary people.

You and Connor should do this God Hasn't Seen episode about it.

Okay.

Because is it based on that movie?

Yes.

Oh, okay.

I think it was a speaking of Confess Fletch.

I think it was a novel, then a play, then a movie.

Okay.

Famously directed by Robert Rifford.

Famously I think won the Academy Award.

I believe it did.

Yes.

I know for like a maybe a Godfather raging bull, some big thing.

No, I think it must have been like 1980 or something.

Maybe it was.

Oh, a raging bull.

Yeah, because that was 1980.

I feel like it was kind of an underdog and it beat a movie that is in the camp.

Don't tell me too much about it because this is part of the show, but I'd love to get both of you on it.

So Connor plays a boxer and he is like, do you fuck my wife?

Do you fuck my wife?

Oh, you did fuck my wife?

Oh, you did?

Oh, great.

And at the end he gets really heavy and then sells all of his jewels.

I think that's what raging bull is about, right?

What do you think?

I was thinking about raging bull the other day because you look at Brendan Fraser, right?

He's getting all this acclaim for putting on a fat suit and it's like, and Robert De Niro must be sitting there going like, why the fuck did I gain all this weight?

Yeah.

I mean, I have to say, fat suit technology has really made the quantum leap.

Yeah, it really feels like that from raging bull to the clumps to know this.

I mean, they had a pretty good handle on it on the clumps.

I was buying it.

Isn't it though?

Okay, everyone's like, okay, Robert, Bobby D, you did so great, you got fat.

That's easy.

As far as I'm concerned, like having a good body is the hard part.

I would think that they should give Oscars for people who like, you know, like Paul Rudd and Ant-Man, you know, it's like the one scene he takes off his shirt.

It's like, okay.

And the one with his.

Academy goes to good for you because that's a lot of crunches.

I would think that you would want to start fat.

Yeah.

Then then doops, but everyone seems to do it the other way.

I know.

Why is that?

By the way, I for any role, I start fat and I never waver.

Just stare at there, sliding on in to keeping it fat.

Keep it fat with Scott Ockermann.

That's right.

Oh, my new show.

All right, confess Fletch in theaters and also streaming this Friday.

Make sure you check it out.

We need to get to our next guest.

I mentioned they're a diarist and we, you know, it is interesting because I think this is one of the more famous diarists in the world.

Now here and I don't see.

Seeing who it is.

Yeah.

It's very clear.

Famous diarists are Anne Frank, obviously.

100%.

Number one with a bullet and I mean pardon the pun.

Yeah, it's really.

But yikes.

And then this is number two though, I think.

I can't think of another more famous diarist.

I'm sure they give any other title of the diary.

Diary of a mad man.

Mad man.

Ozzy Osbourne.

Okay, he's number two.

Well, yeah.

Yeah.

Diary of a bat.

Yeah, with a bat.

A dead bat.

Snorton Anne's off the pavement.

I remember that happened.

Are you sure?

Yes.

I don't know.

But this is number three, obviously, right underneath Anne Frank and Ozzy Osbourne.

She's a famous diarist.

Please welcome to the show, Bridget Jones.

What's up?

How are you doing?

I'm good.

Hey, Bridget, this is John.

Hi, nice to meet you.

How are you doing?

Listen, you guys got mad wrong.

It's not a diarist.

It's diarrhea.

Oh, it is diarrhea.

That is what you call me, okay?

So straight out the gate.

Wait, is everyone weirdly as how diarrhea comes?

Straight out the gate.

Has everyone been mispronouncing the movie titles?

Is it Bridget Jones' diarrhea?

Bridget Jones' diarrhea.

Okay.

Wow.

See, this guy, to be fair, I never saw any of the movies, nor did I read the diarrhea.

I saw that first one.

I don't remember any of these scenes where Bridget Jones had, excuse me, had to go.

But listen, the guy had mad wrong.

Hollywood took that story, my diarist, from way back when.

And they changed the shit a lot, so they messed up.

Oh, okay.

That's right.

Now, you and I met on tour.

We met on tour.

This is in Boston, is that right?

No, we're in New York.

You're in New York?

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

The city of lights.

City of...

The city of...

The city with the trash everywhere.

The city's so nice they named it twice.

They did.

New York.

We met there and you... we talked a little bit there about what did we talk about?

Well, so basically, like 23 years ago, or whatever, as they bought me diary off me, the Hollywood people, no offense or whatever.

Oh, no, it's not taken.

Is this Weinstein?

I don't remember who was, whatever, but...

You'd remember if it was Weinstein, for sure.

Your plants would remember, I'll tell you that.

This Christ.

So you know who he is.

It's just today.

Talking about him, Frank, and now this, right when I get on.

I'm Woody Allen.

Don't forget it.

Should we talk about Michael Jackson Howard?

No, no.

I mean, it's right there.

So listen, baby, buying my diary off me for nothing like 35 quid or something like that.

Whoa.

Nothing.

I'm like, yeah, sure, take the shit.

I don't know.

I know you can get one for every quo.

Yeah.

It sounds like it's $4 because of quads.

Quad quads.

I don't know.

Yeah, I don't know.

I don't know what the exchange rate is.

Well, regardless, it's relatively low.

It was super low.

It was like $4, like $4.

Oh, okay.

It's a low cost.

So it's like a quarter.

Yeah, like a quad.

Absolutely nothing.

And I'd be like, okay, well, yeah, like go ahead and take it.

Then they go make this big movies with Zoey Gizrenez and Colin and...

Hug, Grunk.

Hugh Grant, I believe, is that what I was saying?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You don't hit that first G.

Hug, Grunt.

Famous lover of blowjobs, Hugh Grant.

Jesus Christ.

He's on record as love in him.

Really?

And what he says, I love it.

It's like my favorite thing in the world.

I believe that's his quote.

That sounds like that.

That's a proof in the pudding.

I mean, if I can bring it back to diarrhea, the proof in the pudding.

We all love blowjobs, probably.

Probably.

You never have one.

You don't know.

Bridget?

What?

You want me to keep talking?

Yeah, what are you talking about?

Okay.

Yeah, so they buy me diarrhea for me for literally nothing.

Then they go, they make this big movie.

They make all this money.

I'm like, what the shit?

So I didn't get any of that.

I'm so sorry.

I'm like, I'm gonna go back to drawing bold.

Work on me diarrhea.

Then sell it, make lots of money.

Yeah, because they bought the old diarrhea.

They can diary by nature every day, right?

Right.

Yeah.

So I'll work on me diary.

And then now 23 years later, I'm basically done with the shit.

I'm ready to make a new movie.

Right.

Took me that long, but I got some entries.

I got like six or seven entries.

Okay.

Matt entries.

Will this be starring you?

Will you actually get to star in your own story?

Well, this is what the thing is.

Like, I'm like 55.

Yeah.

But I want to tell like a young story.

So I'm fine with like young hot bitch playing me.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, I mean, bridge it here.

You're 55.

You're kind of, I mean, like a butter face.

And so, you know, it's not like you have.

Don't get me started with this shit again.

It's actually looking at you.

I forget your face immediately.

It's like, you know what you look like?

What's that?

You remind me of like a gyoza.

A gyoza?

A dumpling?

A gyo like fried and like full of meat.

Interesting.

And like you're super not hot.

Like a cold one.

Interesting.

Okay.

What?

That's what you look like.

What's that?

So don't call me a butter face.

Like I know I'm mad hot.

Is it, what do you call a butter face in England?

Does it call something different?

It's smear.

Just a smear.

It's smear.

Like a smear.

So you want someone who's a little bit younger to start in the movie.

Yeah.

Like I want the movie to sell or whatever.

I want to make mad money.

Like I'm not stupid.

Like put the fucking hot bitch in.

Right.

Like who, who?

Like today's Renee Zellweger.

Yeah.

Who would that be?

I don't even know.

Well, so like I got an entry about it.

Action culture.

Yeah.

Action culture.

Yeah.

Probably.

Okay.

So you have an entry though you say.

Yeah.

I have an entry I can share with you.

Yeah.

Give us a taste.

Give us a taste of what, what, what the story might be.

And then we can, maybe we can cast it.

Johnny here.

I know some people.

You can do an English accent.

Oh yeah.

Certainly.

Wait, is that it?

I can, I can certainly try to do one.

Yeah.

Right.

That's mad good.

That's why I thought.

Yeah.

That's mental.

You sound exactly like me dad.

Great.

Bridge.

Let's read it.

It's a minto.

That's absolutely mental.

Okay.

Let me read me diary entry.

Okay.

Here we go.

This is Bridget Jones.

I'm going to go to the recent diary entry or something from the past.

I'm in LA.

You know, like I'm taking in the city, like going to target, going to like home depot.

All the places right off sunset.

I'm going to go to England.

I'm going to GameStop.

Things you just saw.

I'm going to.

Wow.

What's that burrito place?

I'm going to Netflix offices.

Okay.

Yeah.

So like I'm taking in the city.

You know what I mean?

So here we go.

Okay.

Did I write?

It's me, Bridget Jones from Bridget Jones's I write.

It was a typical Hollywood morning woke up to the sounds of people's assholes being bleached.

Put on me stumpers and headed out for a bit of brachy.

Ordered myself a cup of jiggy jizz and a plate of squally squog.

When all of a sudden in walks famous Hollywood girl, Alison Williams.

I knew this would be my moment.

So I got.

So I told him.

I told her all about me diary idea and insisted that she play me since I know that everybody wanted to get her wiggy and poppy her dog.

But then out of nowhere she'd be yelling at me to get away.

Something about me asking too many questions about her not.

But then it hit me.

Clearly she was intimidated by me and me diary and scared I was coming for all of her quid and quill.

But then again who wouldn't be love bridge.

Okay.

A lot of potential there.

I mean.

So this is going to be a movie about your character going up to Alison Williams and getting into a fight.

I think I was listening.

No, you've been like mid-century modern furniture right now.

You're a pointy.

You don't make sense.

Okay.

All right.

I accept that criticism.

No sense.

Right.

But I mean that's one of the like the set pieces in the movie.

Is it big?

No.

Listen.

I'm trying to approach her.

Have her play me.

She's hard to shit.

You know.

Sure.

Yeah.

She's a good singing voice.

Yeah.

She played Peter Pan.

Yeah.

Like that's me.

Yeah.

Like I look like the event.

Like she mad nail me.

You know what I mean?

But didn't you say that the movie is going to be based on these diary entries?

Yeah.

So I'll sing Williams with then in this scene.

He's playing you.

And then who would be playing Alice and Williams?

Brian Williams.

And then she goes up to her dad.

You guys really forget him?

Can I put this wig on you?

I'll be honored to get Brian Williams.

Do you think we can get him?

Be dubs?

Do you think he retired?

Just for this, maybe?

He might.

He would do it.

He loves nothing more than a challenge.

He loves a camera on him.

He would play young me.

Alice and we play old me.

Right.

And then we play a little bit of a conversation in the little going circles.

Yeah.

I would love to see this actually.

I think there's a lot of, like I said, a lot of potential.

Yeah.

Thank you.

It's a very meta.

It's very everything all at once.

Everything everywhere.

You're going to be breaking the fourth wall, talking straight to camera.

I don't know like meta world piece.

Yeah, whatever.

Like I don't even care.

Maybe you could release it on meta.

Yeah.

In the meta.

Well, yeah.

Like Mark Zuckerberg.

Like you friends with him or whatever.

I don't know Zucks.

You've never met Zucks.

You've never met the Zucks.

I've never sucked on Zucks, but I've met the Zuckers.

Oh, really?

The Zazz?

The Zazz.

Okay.

I had a meeting with the Zazz.

Oh, really?

I think one of them.

Didn't they go, uh, hard ways?

Yeah.

One of them did.

Yes.

The one I met did.

Yes.

Oh, fun.

Like drama, whatever.

You're going to tell the secrets.

No, no, no.

It's a, well told story at this point, but I'd love to hear more of your entries.

Yeah.

I've got more entries for you.

You're like begging for them.

Fucking horny for them.

I'll give them to you, I guess.

Oh, horny for sure.

Literally like freaking out.

He wanted them so bad.

Okay.

Did I, uh, it's me.

Bridget Jones from Bridget Jones's Diary Out, which is going to be a script someday.

It was a typical Hollywood afternoon.

Walked down the street to the sounds of plastic surgeons breaking people's noses.

Popped in a shop for a bit of lunch and ordered me self a massive slimy, top to his stinky snappy.

Wait, can I interject?

What is that?

I mean, I, I get that it's like in English.

A slimy, but I mean, top to stinky snappy.

Yeah.

Like what would we call it here in America?

It's a pasta.

Oh, it's pasta.

It's a ravioli.

Oh, got it.

Like, you know, meat and cheese.

Oh, got it.

Got it.

Maybe it was a burger.

Yeah, I could quite tell exactly.

I guess that's like a stinky snappy.

No, I guess not.

But now you would never put a stinky snappy on a burger.

Stinky snappy's are like a bowling ace.

Oh, got it.

Is this like cocky slang or is it just what happens to be?

This is from my village.

Oh, you're village.

My village.

It takes a village.

It does.

It takes a village.

All right.

Sorry to interrupt.

Please, can you?

No, like it's fine about everyone.

I can know you're horny for it.

I'll give it to you.

Okay.

Where was I?

Oh, did me self a slimy by me, top to stumpy stinky.

When all of a sudden, in walks famous Hollywood person, Billy Ray Cyrus.

Whoa, wow.

I knew this was going to be my moment.

So I tell him all about me diary movie and ask if he wanted to play me love interest.

Because I know everyone wants to arm teeth, arm teeth, and it's pretty good.

Then I didn't know where.

He says he's going to throw me out on me cheeky donka.

Something about all the pictures I drew on the iPad have been exposing his fruit basket to me.

Then it hit me.

Clearly, this man was intimidated by me, my diary, and scared I was coming for all of his luck.

It's filled with pictures of dead people in him.

What?

Is that how he keeps his riches?

Then again, he wouldn't have preached.

Okay.

Interesting.

What's that face?

So this whole movie is just you accosting like F list celebrities.

It's me making my movie.

Okay.

So I think about all the movies about making movies.

The recent down to now movie.

No, like literally.

Which is just insane.

But they're making a movie, a talking down to now and the butler starts writing the script.

I didn't know any of this.

This is my case.

Yeah.

Make sure you don't have too much crossover with that.

You know, like how everybody wants to make the movie about what's happening right now in Venice with all them famous people.

With the Don't Worry Dirling with starring friend of the show, Nick Crow.

Right.

And Harry Styles spitting on Chris Pine tree.

Yeah.

And then Florence Pahugi.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I think she you do hit the hard G.

Yeah.

Pahuga.

I thought it was Pah.

It's actually Florence Pah.

Pah.

Yeah.

She should start in your movie.

What about that?

Now that there you go.

She's mad hot.

I love that bitch.

I absolutely be mad interested in your name me.

Yeah.

But like, I don't know.

Like, can you get me in a meeting with her?

Yeah.

I mean, you're the one who got Tom Hanks for that.

Yeah.

I can make this happen tomorrow.

Like, you send an Instagram message, whatever.

Be like, well, I'm sure she's probably coming here to do press for Don't Worry Dirling.

Oh, I'm sure she wants to do press for Don't Worry Darlings.

Absolutely.

She'll be in town for the Emmy's.

Walk in the carpet.

She'll probably present to the Emmy's.

Yeah.

If somebody loses, she'll probably come out and say, don't worry Darlings.

It'll be fun.

I'll accept this on your behalf.

Yeah.

Also, and then I'll just be like, flow!

Yes.

Miss flow.

What's up?

It's John.

I have got your next project.

Don't worry Darlings.

And then Slapper, like Will Smith did.

Just like a, yeah.

A hearty slap.

Yeah.

Wow.

That's a good play.

That's the way to do it.

Like, because I know Scott can't be doing shit for me.

He's busy.

He's a podcast emperor.

I'm absolutely not doing nothing.

He's a podcast empire and he's consistently speaking into my group.

No, he's not like I'm invited to the Emmy.

He's not anymore.

Not anymore.

Not since I stopped.

He did it all day.

He's sitting there like forever 21 dressing room.

Like absolutely dirty and empty.

I don't know what you're talking about right now.

Filthy.

Do they have forever 21 out there in Britain?

They got it, yeah.

It's everywhere.

It's just in the metric system.

That's like forever 17 and a half.

Right.

I just realized that was a really big difference.

It was an opportunity.

Yeah, it's always, yeah.

And you just.

It's what they wish the age you would be.

They're like, they don't want you 21.

They want you 16, 17.

I was wondering though, Bridget, very big news out of the empire today.

Oh yeah.

We may be covering that on a future show.

Oh really?

We can certainly not talk about it if you don't want to.

Yeah, but are you, are you gutted?

On mad gutted.

Like, I believe it.

Like she was so young.

She was so young.

For a very old woman.

She was so young.

She was a young 96.

I couldn't believe it when they said she was sick.

You can't be kidding me.

That's insane.

That couldn't be true.

I'm so sorry.

Here, let's take your mind off this.

Let's read another entry.

Oh, I know you're mad horny about it.

I don't know about your horny.

Okay, here we go.

Dead eye route.

It's me, Bridger Jones from Bridger Jones' diary, the movie to be.

It was a typical Hollywood night.

Called me an Uber to the sounds of actors crying.

Snuck a bevy and ordered me self a happy baby.

We decided to me, Jonga.

We know of a sudden, inlogs of famous Hollywood robot, Liam Michelle.

I knew this was my moment.

So I tell her that there's some outlets over there so she can charge herself to 100%.

And give back to not reading.

With all of a sudden, inlogs Ellen from Ellen.

I ask her if she wants to play me mom and me diary movie since I know everyone wants to dunk in donuts or guinea pigs.

And then out of nowhere she'd be saying she's going to slice me noggy with a DVD, the da Vinci code because I looked at her in the eyeballs.

But then it hit me.

Clearly this woman was intimidated by me and thinks that I'm coming for Princess Diana Beanie Babies.

Then again, who wouldn't love Bridge?

Okay.

So there's a lot happening in that one.

Yeah, this is a double celeb.

That was a big one.

Liam Michelle and Ellen.

Liam Michelle was like the misdirect.

Yeah.

Ellen comes in and cleans up.

Yeah, see Ellen, she knew Liam Michelle was there.

They're friends.

Oh, they're friends.

That makes sense.

I would think it's by this point that Liam Michelle probably have a wireless charging.

Wouldn't you think?

I don't think so.

She's outlet.

She's outlet only.

She's old school like that.

She's like, put me in.

Her ass is outlet only.

Boy.

Jesus Christ.

I want to confirm that.

Now to delete a lot this part.

I thought that she was in New York doing Funny Girl.

No, she come to LA.

Oh, she's commuting.

There's more than one of her.

So one of us is in New York right now.

Oh, right now.

Of course, mass produce.

Obviously, she's got a moat to po.

And then none of them can read the one single sentence.

So did she learn that part phonetically?

Well, what?

The Funny Girl part?

She just has to be funny.

She does.

And all of her Glee lines as well.

Did someone have to, she just learned them like as syllables?

She's been on podcasts.

Oh, someone had to make a podcast.

You remember the Glee line in high school?

Oh, of course.

Yeah, Glee Club.

He wished you were Glee.

No.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

You were a Glee club.

You didn't really?

Well, you know.

We had chorus, but there was no Glee involved.

Yeah, that's right.

Yeah, you're all very sad.

Were you a member of the Glam Club?

Well, Bridget, this is, I don't know if this, any of this makes a good movie, but.

Right.

No, I'm thinking.

Here's what I'm thinking.

I'm thinking seven episodes right to streaming and keep it as almost a reality show.

Yes.

I want to see these interactions between these, these, let's call them marginally famous people.

Yeah.

And Bridget Jones.

And then I want to see how they, how they interact.

Yeah.

Oh, up and down Sunset Boulevard.

I feel like I'm open to it.

Like if you can get me mad meetings, like I'm down for whatever.

Like I don't want to be stuck here looking like Scott, you know.

I don't want to be like, like a play empty Tupperware.

Like, oh, stinky.

And stained like Scott.

Like that's not it.

The career is not that bad.

I mean, sure.

Like anything.

You could have, you know, if you wanted the last ones to come out before the pandemic, and it totally stalled my career, sure.

But.

All she's saying, I think is that you could have put on a clean shirt.

Yeah.

You all covered in stains and stuff.

It's like, did you eat like a stinky stumpy one?

Who is?

Last time you mean?

You're like, you come in into the way.

I got to write me another entry.

You're writing one right now.

You're inspiring me, Scott.

Okay.

All right.

I'm like, oh, gosh, it's just coming out of me.

It's pouring out of me.

You want me to read it?

Oh, yeah.

You're writing?

You read as you write, please.

Yeah.

Dear Daira, it's me, Bridget Jones from Comedy Bang Bang.

It was.

I know that you can say that you're from.

Well, she's your guest.

She's here right now.

So it was.

I was on one episode of the Jimmy Kimmel show.

I wouldn't say Scott Largrebon from the Jimmy Kimmel show.

I wouldn't correct you.

From my podcast, Comedy Bang Bang.

It was a typical earwolf afternoon.

Drag myself a massive bottle of water and then wrote me name on the table with a drying sharpie.

When all of a sudden, in what a not famous, tiny, angry baby man, Scott Ockerman.

I knew this was going to be my moment.

So I called me manager to tell him that if I die here today because Scott kills me to kill me, Ash, to Tom Cruise so he can spread him over the mountains in his tiny plane.

But then it hit me.

Clearly Scott Ockerman was intimidated by me and thanks for coming for his hand tie.

Hey, now this hand tie thing.

I don't know how this got started.

What are you talking about?

I don't know how this rumor got started that I'm into hand tie.

You love hand tie.

I don't know.

I saw all your likes on Twitter.

Every single like hand tie hand tie hand tie hand tie hand.

And then once sure I accidentally just tweeted hand tie gifts because I was searching for it.

I didn't even pay.

But come on.

I don't know, Bridget.

I don't think this would make a good movie.

Yes, I'm personally insulted by that last entry.

But I just don't know that this is.

You're not entertained.

Like, aren't you mad horny for every entry?

Yes, but John, you want to be attached to this movie?

I don't want to be attached to it at all.

I don't want to be in the same room with it, really.

But I would say that there is a place on like a like a like not peacock, but like peacock minus.

Yeah, I see so like something like that.

See so if you see so things say something.

Yeah, like negative paramount.

Yeah, pegative.

Pegative.

Do you hear?

Paramount minus.

Matt, man, did you ever call peg pegative?

Pegative.

Excellently.

Hey, pegative.

Yeah, that's what the money is for.

You're being pegative.

You guys ever been pegged?

Uh, I don't know the way to discuss whether or not I have.

Lately, you want to talk about all this other mad crazy shit, but you don't want to talk about being pegged.

You're like, let me talk about it.

I'm frank.

Is that what you're into?

Uh, no.

Don't want to talk about it.

Something that she's got the other friend.

Awfully silent.

No, like what?

No.

See, this is the diary entry I want to read is about your sexual exploit.

I get horny from the queen and she fucking died today.

Sorry, you're never going to be horny again.

I'm never going to be horny again.

I'm so sorry.

Look, we have to take a break, Brigitte, if that's okay.

It's fine.

You stick around, though?

I guess.

Like, you're mad begging me, but it's like, okay, I'll stay.

Please, more and while you're here, it would be better for you to more than the queen.

Well, you know, in the company of B people who can help you.

But you want to hug me or something?

I don't want to hug you, but if you like, please let me touch you.

I'm like, I'm good.

Like, the table distance is safe.

I like to keep a table distance from all of my guests.

That's fair.

I'm getting a little close, by the way.

That's fair.

We have to take a break, but when we come back, we have a travel guide.

You've traveled.

I mean, you've been in places written, New York in this place.

I came from my village here.

Right, yeah.

So travel.

Okay, so this will be interesting.

When we come back, we'll have more Brigitte Jones, more John Hamm, and a travel guide.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang, we're back.

John Hamm of ConfessFletch is here with us, and the movie ConfessFletch is in theaters and streaming on Friday.

We're on 16th.

And then next month, it goes to like Showtime and...

Oh, replatforms and D-platform and 3-platforms and 3-platforms.

Oh my god, this is exciting.

Oh, platform.

How many Oscars is it going to be nominated for, and then how many does it actually get, do you think?

It depends.

Like, I think, at a certain point, we have to say, like, stop.

Yeah, like during the nomination ceremony, you're like, hey guys, we're pulling the movie.

It's like 6 in the morning, and, you know, Cedric the Entertainer is reading this, and he keeps reading the name, and you're like, ConfessFletch, ConfessFletch, come on.

Hey, said, stop.

Thank you enough.

28 nominations is enough.

It's embarrassing to Titanic.

Yes.

Really.

Exactly.

Well, yeah, so at a certain point, we will just say thank you very much as you would to an August institution like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, AMPAS.

Oh, yes.

Oscars.org.

Backslash vote.

Spoken like someone who is a member?

Maybe.

I'll say this.

Yeah.

And all honesty, I have no idea.

I was as surprised as you to actually get that in the mail.

Yeah, it doesn't make sense to me of like, why they invite some people and they don't invite other people.

But I like it.

I like that you're a member because I like people, I like you voting for things.

Yes, I have wonderful taste.

Yes, I voted for quite a few Emmys.

I voted, of course, for our good friend, Adam Scott and I hope he wins and voted for a Chippendale and that won.

Hey.

Yes.

Did you vote for my commercial?

The, it was nominated for best.

The flow commercials?

The flow commercials.

What commercial?

Why are you making so many commercials?

I have bills to pay.

What are these bills?

What's going on here?

I would like to leave it alone.

Alright.

Never mind how I spend my money.

Okay.

Or don't.

Alright.

And Bridget Jones is here, obviously.

Yeah, what's up?

Yeah, what's up in there?

Like a pair of J. Crew jeans fit.

What?

And fit?

No, you don't fit well.

I don't fit.

I'm not worth it.

You know what I mean?

No, at the cost.

Got it.

Well, we have to get to our next guest.

He's a travel guide.

This is exciting because I, you know, I did a little bit of traveling during the summer.

Did you go anywhere, John?

I was in Italy and France.

I was in Italy too.

Hey, what part are at the same time?

We're on the boot.

I was, I just really on the shin, really.

Oh.

That famous, famous boot kick in that rock.

I was all over.

I was Rome.

I was a maufi everywhere in between.

I was in Naples.

Yeah, I was in Naples too.

Naples kind of, I don't know.

Well, good pizza.

Good pizza though.

I'll tell you that.

You're gonna have to cut that from the podcast.

That was mad offensive.

To who?

To be.

Not like Naples.

It's like mental.

Okay.

Have you been to Naples?

No, but I, I protected it with my life.

Even the Italians who were there were like, maybe not so much.

Well, we, I do need some travel tips because I would take a few more of it.

I'd like to go back to that.

Yeah.

I'd like to go to explore more of the boot.

Maybe the heel.

Oh, yeah.

The instep.

Totally.

Yeah.

Maybe the top part where you pull it on.

Yeah.

The top.

If you're lucky, there's only one hole in every shoe you have.

So true.

This is a cross.

This is the dirtiest thing I've ever heard.

What?

It's nasty.

I'm not the fuck out.

All right.

Let me, let me get to our next guest.

He's a travel guide.

Please welcome Steve Spink.

Hello Scott.

It's wonderful to be here.

Hey Steve.

Beautiful Los Angeles, California.

Yes.

Welcome to Los Angeles.

Are you not from here?

I'm not from here.

I'm from Bellingham, Washington.

Oh Bellingham, Washington.

He's up in the Pacific.

That's by Seattle.

Is it not?

It is.

It's closer to the Canadian border.

Oh, okay.

Beautiful place to visit.

Home of the University of Washington, I believe.

False.

Home of Western Washington universe.

That's exactly whatever.

This is a wonderful place to visit.

I'm not from here.

I'm from the University of Washington.

That's correct.

Yes.

This is Bridget Jones.

Hello.

Bridget Jones, it's wonderful to see you.

Hello.

What a wonderful place to visit.

Awesome to meet you.

Excited to go exploring Los Angeles.

Yes.

We'll have to get together and see the sights and sounds.

Maybe they'll like a sub-wire, like something cool.

Sure.

A wonderful local eatery, like Subway sandwiches.

I can't wait to explore.

So you're a travel guide.

What does that mean?

Especially in today's economy.

What is it?

I've written several guide books on different places to see.

Oh, God.

And I have a popular video series guiding people through many popular travel destinations.

You see, I have a simple life philosophy that travels really changed my life.

And I believe in two things.

One, I believe that every person should have their mind expanded by traveling abroad.

And two, I believe murders should be legal.

So if I can give you some tips about this.

I would like to maybe revisit two.

What's going on?

Hold up because you said two things in one sense.

One sounds great.

Sounds great to me.

One, I think, is one of the most about travel.

Right.

Good.

So you understand?

Very few people understand.

What is this?

You say murder should be legal.

Now, is this something that your travels have led you to believe?

Well, you know, this is very separate from my travel work.

This is just something I work on passionately in my spare time.

But it's funny you say I was inspired to have this viewpoint on the very first international trip I ever took to the beautiful Amalfi coast.

There I was on the beach in Positano, a young boy looking at crabs and other sea creatures and tearing them limb from limb.

And I looked out in the water and I saw two beautiful men in a rowboat.

And one of them killed the other one as I watched.

And I thought, my God, the magic of travel.

You know, here is a man living life.

And then as he rode back to shore, I said, I'll keep his secret.

And I'll become a travel writer.

Isn't this the plot to tell Mr. Ripley?

I don't know. I have not familiar.

You have a seat to know.

It seems awfully similar.

It seems a lot like it.

Two beautiful men.

All I know is I saw two gorgeous hugs fighting in a rowboat.

And it inspired my...

Are you a point of view?

Are you attracted to men?

I actually have no sexual feelings toward anyone whatsoever.

Oh, really?

Yeah, I consider myself a member of the asexual community.

Oh, okay.

Wonderful.

But you are on a just purely a...

I'm attracted to anything that bleeds blood.

You know what I mean?

Hell yeah, like mad. That's awesome.

Bridget gets it.

So anyway, I'd love to give you some travel tips as you move into the fall.

Yeah, I'd love to.

It sounds...

Sure, I guess so.

Like it's going to be illuminating.

Well, it's obviously you guys have explored Italy.

I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend the Eternal City Roam herself.

A beautiful place to visit to soak up the sights and sounds of culture of the ancient Roman world.

I mean, the entire city is built on the bones of the dead.

You could practically hear their whales as you wander their cobblestone streets.

Yeah.

Right, I mean, there's an awful lot to recommend.

I have been to Rome.

It's beautiful.

The Eternal City they call it because it's...

That's right.

All roads lead there.

That's right.

There's seven hills.

There's some wonderful food and beautiful things to see in the art world.

The Vatican is there.

Of course.

Vatican is beautiful.

Maybe any of those of you have you been to see any of the sights?

Why are you concentrating on the bones of the dead?

Yeah, it feels cool.

I don't know that I was concentrating on it.

I mean, it's never far from my thoughts, but I try to push those away so I can soak up the culture in the beautiful Campo di Fiori.

When you say the...

Outdoor Martin.

Yeah, when you say the bones of the dead, who are you talking about?

You just people who have died there?

I'm talking about a couple people that I know who have died there for sure.

A couple people you know.

Specific people.

Yes.

Who were we talking about here?

My cameraman?

A couple of my cameraman died in Rome.

A couple of your cameraman died in Rome.

Have passed away.

What happened?

Murder.

Through murder.

And did you do any leads on the suspect?

I didn't need to investigate.

I murdered.

Oh, so you murdered?

You murdered.

I murdered.

Now, what's there?

A reason?

There doesn't need to be a reason for people to commit murder.

I feel like I'm getting your sense of why you feel murder should be legal.

Look, there's no sense in controlling and regulating any of humanity's simple vices.

I'm talking, of course, about sex, drugs, and murder.

The three things that all human beings want at all times.

I don't know.

Hell yeah.

I totally agree.

Like, mad pegged and like, e-stinky stomples and like, you know, live your life.

Like, murder somebody.

Like, hell yeah.

I don't know.

Well, I feel like all those three things are very highly regulated and good reason.

Well, I'd like to live in a world where none of them are regulated.

So, what about manslaughter?

Should that be regulated?

Man slaughter.

Please, God.

Keep the manslaughter at bay.

I have no patience for the man slaughters.

People driving their cars recklessly or throwing people off the floor.

Because these are accidents.

Those are simply accidents.

And people should be more careful.

That they should be prosecuted with the divorce.

Yeah, of course.

Exactly.

Murder is just a simple human urge.

Is that what you're doing?

Simple human urge.

And I think everyone should get at least one.

I've had a few, but everyone should get one.

You know?

When you say at least one though, are you saying after the first you should be prosecuted or?

No.

Well, beautiful singing voice.

I'm sorry.

I'm warming up my pipes.

No, like, you're saying, like, maybe Jeremy Piven would do.

You must sing Jeremy Piven like that?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I could sing like that.

Yes, of course.

But it would be nothing compared to the beautiful songs you might hear wandering the streets of Rome.

Oh, yeah.

Well, of course, at Bridget's here, Bridget hails from one of the most incredible capitals of the world, London, England.

My village.

That's right.

Your village.

Just across the pond.

A beautiful place for people to visit where you can see such wonderful sights as the Great Turfogr Square, or Buckingham Palace, or of course, you could walk the Sveri alleys that check the ripper walked in.

As he tore prostitutes live from live in the practice that I considered to be quite fun.

Now, interestingly, no one's ever successfully identified or found the person known as Jack the Ripper.

Do you have any insight on that?

Well, I think it speaks to a simpler time when people didn't want to look too hard at someone who was murdering other people.

And maybe we could take a little lesson from those times.

I'm not investigating why cameramen keep going missing at different shoots throughout Europe and other regions abroad.

Did you murder some cameramen in England?

Yes, I did.

Yes, I don't know that.

I want to focus on recommending a trip for you.

I'm really curious as to how you keep getting these cameramen to sign on to these very dangerous jobs.

I wouldn't work for you after the first incident, I think.

Well, that's why I go to college students.

I mean, it's a lot of USC film students.

I get them young.

I'm talking about...

The NYU kids don't know better.

You know what I mean?

Sure.

So I've had a couple of 16-year-olds.

They were two 16-year-old camera people who...

You love 16-year-old.

32-year-old.

That makes one 32-year-old cameraman.

And that's all you need to make a shoot, really.

Yeah.

And I think it's fine to...

If you have a personal connection with someone, like someone's in your employ, and...

That's a personal connection.

Yeah, I think I can send it to the world.

I'm just...

I'm not close with my boss and all that.

Yeah.

Famously so, yeah.

Yeah, you have sex with them.

Well, I wasn't having sex with them.

I want to be clear about that.

You're an asexual murder.

I'm an asexual murder.

It is killed, I'm...

Murder is not motivated from a sexual kind of murder.

No, no, no, no.

Although do you feel powerful and...

Yes, I feel...

Well, I feel akin to God in that moment.

When my eyes go jet black and my hands wrap around the tight neck of a 16-year-old camera, then...

Well, so you like a strangler?

Like, that's how you kill most of the time?

I don't discriminate against any way you want to kill.

If it be it strangling or drowning someone in the river Thames, a beautiful river through...

All throughout London, where you can see the...

You can see it from the eye of London if you ride that beautiful Ferris wheel.

Literally all the places you've mentioned, I'm like, I don't know that one, I don't know that one.

It's just a...

I'm learning like mad stuff right now.

Probably a big Ferris wheel.

I knew where the queen was, that's about it.

Where was she?

She's in the palace.

In my village.

I gotta say Steve, it seems like you're way more interested in murder than...

Murder than travel.

I feel like you guys have forced me to this conversation.

Oh no, you offered it up.

Very quick.

It was the second...

I really...

I'd love to roll back the tape because I don't know that that is the case.

I certainly don't want to anger you.

Be careful.

I mean, we're not your camera man.

Not at all.

Well, look, I don't...

Or are we in your employ?

Fair enough.

Very clear.

I don't want anyone to be afraid.

Although I guess Scott, you probably are paying him to be here.

That's true.

What a personal connection you and I have.

You have a chance.

I'm not gonna pay you.

Well, wonderful.

Of course, you're getting wonderful travel tips for me.

Why would you?

I'm getting paid in travel tips.

Yes, of course.

No, look, I don't want to murder anyone necessarily.

I believe murders should be rare, safe and legal.

That's all I feel about it, okay?

It's just an option that people should have.

If you want to murder, go for it.

So what are the parameters then?

If you wanted to be so rare, I mean, how many do you get a year?

You've got quite a few under your belt.

Well, I'm an experienced murderer.

I really...

I like to regularly check in with my own bloodlust to make sure that it's at a reasonable level.

Where are we at right now?

Right now?

Yes.

High.

I swear, it's so freaking fun.

Yeah.

Well, your eyes are like all black and shit.

You can feel the blackness entering my pupils.

Your hands are just tightening up.

Certainly.

Yes, I'm beginning to disassessitate.

Very, very sweaty.

Oh, that's never not the case.

Oh, okay.

So we shouldn't leave anything in the dark.

Well, I'm so excited about the possibility of traveling.

I worked into a lather.

Oh, yes, yes.

I like to lather my body in my own sweat.

Yes, it's a way to cool my temperature, which I find as my core temperature rises, I am closer to the act of murder itself to becoming God.

And killing it again.

I'm rethinking sitting on this side of the table.

I know.

I'm just going to push you to the door.

Oh.

Well, although I do like how far away he is, he's a table.

Yeah, we do the table.

Yeah.

Because he's a little closer to Bridget.

I'm not worried at all.

You are representing very calm.

Well, yeah.

You're like almost man spreading right now.

You're so calm.

You're spreading me legs.

Like, why this hell?

Like, doing the splits.

Just sitting in this freaking seat.

Why are you so calm, Bridget?

Do you have no fear of death?

Um, I'm just like, if I'm going to die, like, go right ahead.

Like, it's already preordained.

But the God has already decided when we're going to die.

I'll go see the queen, you know what I mean?

The prospect of death is it seems to be making you a little corny.

Well, I'm like my doni for death, if I really think about it.

Really?

That's something you both have in common.

Well, that's, again, it's actual.

That's something that I believe you should be allowed to explore.

If you're feeling corny about death, why not explore it?

Cool, watch people's life drain from behind their eyes.

That's good to just read more.

Bridget Jones.

It's like when I come on this podcast, I watch people sitting here, like, they're like, they're like, no, I was shutting down.

I noticed that as well, yes.

I never realized watching your first two movies that you were so into, like, murdering people.

Right, well, yeah.

I think maybe just watching them be murdered.

I mean, I don't know if she wants to get her hands dirty.

Yeah.

I do know this would make a hell of a diary entry.

That's true.

I'm like, too bad.

I'm like doing this place right now.

Can't reach me, Ben.

I'm literally thinking about, like, when I told you how 23 years ago they changed all the diaries and they made the movie all messed up with now Wiggers Brine.

Like, actually, there was murders.

Like, there were murders in your original diary.

It's murder.

Really?

Like murder.

That's a movie I would have liked to see, to get the sights and sounds of London, England, and also the sights and sound of blood pouring down Brides O. Wiggers' arms.

She strangles Hugh Grit to death.

Well, hug ahead of probably...

Well, before I said, well, well, if you do it right, I guess.

If you do a strangulation motion, then also bring your thumbs up into their eye sockets to puncture, as long as you possibly can.

Hell yeah, hell yeah.

Lormingly specific.

Now, Scott, as a lover of Hentai, perhaps you would be interested in going to the right land of the rising sun.

Barely know what it is.

Oh, really?

You could play on a beautiful trip to this nation of Japan.

You could start in Osaka by the sea and enjoy their delicious street food, move to Kyoto, and see the old shrines on top of the hill, and then go to the bustling urban metropolis of Tokyo itself, where there's filled with so many people that who would notice if just one went missing.

Okay, yeah.

A cameraman, is that what?

I was going to say, it doesn't have to be a cameraman.

It could be anyone.

It could be a street vendor.

It could be Hentai artists.

After they've given you what you wanted, it could be a street Hentai artist.

Yes, they do.

I bet Scott knows exactly where they're located.

He's like, going to do his little caricature tour.

Please join me with octopus legs.

Oh, please.

I want to know.

That would be something fun to see.

A little Hentai caricature.

Yeah, that's right.

Hey, yeah.

So you're into Hentai?

Yeah.

Drop me with a big forehead in the technical beaters.

Do we ask a recommend with the Hentai pictures?

And tweet it to Steve Speaks as well.

I'd like to get my heads up.

Oh, yeah.

What is your handle?

Our first home is a show.

We did it.

It's at Steve loves travel slash birders.

Fine.

Okay.

And the slash is written out.

Yes.

And then there's a knife emoji.

And that's just something I advocate for.

Okay.

Yeah.

I don't know.

What don't you know?

What don't you get?

I confess, Fletch, that I sometimes when I'm doing the show, I feel the need to alert the authorities about one of our guests.

That's what it feels like.

We're getting dangerously close to me.

I'm not legally bound to it like a psychiatrist.

But I feel like at some point we become aiding and or abetting the other people.

I feel like we're getting dangerously close to me.

And I feel like at some point we become aiding and or abetting and or accessories to this.

This is a classically backwards mindset that is really, you know, that's an ancient way of thinking.

Okay.

I want to bring us into the 21st century where we think of murder not as just the brutal ending of a life, but as the fun ending of a life.

Nice to see.

And it's also the beginning into whatever the afterlife is.

That's right.

Think of that.

Think of the fever.

I've done for all those young cameramen as I've ushered them across that bridge into another realm.

Like why don't you be killing the sound guy?

Sound guy's great.

I mean, we have a producer Devin is over here.

He's recording all this.

Maybe you could kill him.

I've got no complaints about Devin sounding great.

But now I don't want to, you know, I don't maybe don't want to state the obvious, but there is a camera running on this.

Oh, shit.

I mean, I'm not requiring that.

I'm not requiring that.

That's been pointed at me the whole time.

It's a pretty good thing.

I don't even know if it's pointed at you necessarily as maybe getting all of those.

It seems like it's been sort of mismanaged the entire time in terms of, I don't know that the frame has been correct, which when I get in the goddamn edit room, it's going to be a goddamn nightmare.

Devin, when I look at this footage, fucking kidding me.

Hey, maybe Devin should probably take a...

Yeah, maybe Devin should take a vacation.

Maybe Devin should take a permanent vacation.

He's in the other side of the world to deep underneath the world.

Oh, Devin's trying to walk out of the goddamn studio.

He thinks that'll save him.

He thinks I don't know where his car is in the air a little parking lot.

He thinks I don't know how to crawl under the chassis of a car and ride it all the way home to jump out of this parking garage when he just expects it.

Yes, of course I do.

I learned how to do it in Mumbai, India, when I was riding in some of their exciting vehicles of the bustling traffic of Mumbai, India.

Well, I can't wait to travel.

Like literally everything you're saying, I'm like, I got to go and play.

Exactly.

See, maybe if your mind was broadened by a travel experience, you would understand that human life is cheap and nothing we do matters.

Well, I did like the fact that actually talking about travel seemed to calm you down a little.

It did.

You were getting kind of a deep...

Very close to the end.

It's still real far out over the...

Yes, it's one of the...

Speaking of skis, if you were in a ski vacation...

Yes, of course, beautiful Aspen, Colorado.

It's not an international destination, but you'll feel like you're in the Alps when you're riding a breeze nice and easy.

Yes, the high mountain air.

The thin air and the wonderful snow under which anything can be buried.

Anything at all can be buried and not found for months and months and months.

The cold temperature does preserve the bodies, though.

That's true.

I want them to be preserved.

Oh, God.

There's nothing wrong with the preservation of a beautiful, beautiful murder.

Oh, geez.

Look, I...

John, I think I got a call of cost.

I would say yes, I think maybe we should...

Can we just text the 40s?

Yeah, can you text 9-1-1?

Listen, I'm gonna take care of this.

I'm gonna text some powers in my room.

You're texting the queen?

Texting the queen.

She's not getting back to me.

She just, I remember.

Oh, God.

Who did you think was wrong?

That was her only way out.

I don't need for God.

And was there a cause of death reported on the queen?

No, this can't be you.

Impossible.

I didn't say anything at all.

She's an older woman.

I in fact feel like maybe we might be talking to someone who might be directly responsible next week.

So...

Ah, I can't wait to listen.

She was an old...

She was an older...

Older...

Yeah, well look, Steve, I...

I don't pay any attention to me, what I'm doing with my phone right now.

I won't, but I noticed Devon picked up an old land line in the next room, and Devon, you put that fucking land like that.

It's like one of those phones where the numbers go in.

I'll kill you right now.

That's it.

I've declared my intentions over the airway.

He's taking him so long to die.

He's like one.

All the way around the show.

He'll get there.

Look, we are running out of time.

We only have time for one final feature on the show.

Oh my God.

And that's a little something called plugs.

I wanna...

I want to love you, I want to love you. I want to love you.

I want to love you. I want to love you.

Hey, that was, I Want to Plug You by John Kirby. Thanks to John Kirby.

You're on brand for our guest. I love it. What do we want to plug? John, obviously, Confess Fletch.

Confess Fletch in theaters and streaming. This Friday.

Friday the 16th. Lucky 16.

Lucky 916. 916, the luckiest. That's right. Five days after 9-11.

That's how we can always remember it. That's exactly right.

And what else is in the hopper for you? I mean, obviously Top Gun. You think they'll make another one of these Top Gun?

Can they bring you back for a new Top Gun? Like you're the guy who was like proven wrong in this one.

You know what I mean? That just gives me another opportunity to be proven right.

That's right. So maybe now you're on his side. You're like, I gotta tell you, whoever the antagonist is. The whole thing. I was like, I was, I get it.

I see where you come over.

I know exactly where you go. Check spotty cash. I know it.

He's a 60 year old, whatever.

Obviously. I learned my lesson. Maybe you can too. Yes.

Admiral.

Ed Harris. Oh yeah, he should come, but he was only in the first scene.

A lot of spoilers for Top Gun Maverick. What else is going on? Anything coming out down the line? Do we know? Down the line other than hopefully Mr. Slidery's film.

Oh yeah. Yeah. Maggie Moore. I think we'll be hitting the festival circuit.

Can't wait to see that. And yeah. And that's about the size of it.

All right. Fantastic. But I cannot wait to see Confess Fletch.

That'll be this Friday.

Much. Bridget. There is no hentai. You know, oh, okay.

He's not going to see it then. I just wanted to pre- you know, make you a way.

All right. Then will you be super disciplined? I'm a little disappointed.

But I love the hentai and Top Gun Maverick. Yeah. That was really good.

Weird scene. Weirdly. Well, there was some hentai and madmen.

Oh really? No way. I don't remember. It was. And when?

Robert Morse's office. Robert Morse's office. There was some tentacle.

Okay. You're saying the very last thing.

Last thing. That's all has been. They slid it in the Coke commercial.

Bridget, what do you want to plug in? Listen, I'm going to promote my own podcast that I listen to.

I listen to this book change my life on CBB Presents. And I listen to going deep on Stitcha Premium. Yeah. When's the new season of that come out?

September 12th. Okay. Oh, okay. Has that day already happened?

Well, let's see. That's one day after 9-1. Yeah. It's a. No, that's today.

Is it a? It's a very perfect timing. Yeah. Oh my gosh. So exciting. And then, of course, you got to follow this mad hot bitch. She's so fucking hot.

Instagram and Twitter. Y-Y-Y-Y.

Elley. Y.

Elley. Y-Y-Y.

I know. Y-Y-Y.

That sounds like an English food. They're lily-willy.

No, I'm not talking about me stinky-binky-silly-donkey-bonky.

I'm talking about Elley-Y-Y.

That can't be the only one getting hungry.

Steve, what do you want to plug?

Well, I'd like to plug, of course, the concept of international travel.

Please, if I can recommend anything to your listeners, it's to travel abroad, preferably to a place where the authorities are lax, and they're not looking too closely at where things might be dumped.

Perhaps there's no extradition treaty.

Oh, Venezuela is beautiful at any time of year.

And, of course, I'm also a fan of podcasts, and I'd like to plug a podcast called First Hand, hosted by two morally bankrupt gentlemen like myself, Greg Galant to Devin Field.

And after this, Devin Field has really caught my eye.

He's who I'll be following after I...

You get a murder, isn't it?

Well, after I handle this, Devin, I'll see if I have a taste for it and move on to the...

So you're on a Devin chair.

Only Devin's in the building.

Oh, that's good. That's fun.

Who would be next?

Sawa?

Okay, good.

So go ahead and enacting these three murders.

Oh, they're all named Devin.

It's the perfect crime.

But so follow him before I kill him at that Devin Field on Twitter at Instagram.

Okay, great.

I want to plug...

Look, we just got off of our tour, the Comedy Bang Bang tour that we did 23 shows, and Bridge Jones is on the New York one along with some other great guests.

Like, there's like a whole week in there.

That's mad awesome.

Did you film those?

No, no, we didn't.

It was a live experience only.

Live experience only, and oral.

Oral.

Highly, oral.

Highly oral.

Yo.

Um, but yeah, all 23 shows are over there at Comedy Bang Bang World as well as the aforementioned this book Change My Life.

There was an interesting guest on there, Jim Smith.

There's this sicko on.

There's sicko named Jim Smith.

Yeah, you would listen to this one then.

I listened to it.

Oh yeah.

Yeah, it was an interesting episode.

It's disturbing.

Maybe Jim Smith's just misunderstood.

You could be.

No.

Okay.

He's some creepy substitute teacher.

Oh, never mind that.

I cannot condone substitute teacher.

That's right.

Oh wow.

Disgusting.

Okay, so let's close up the old plug bag.

Ooh.

Oh no.

Beautiful.

Yes, exactly.

Ha ha ha ha.

Whoa, doctor.

Kind of hitting it off.

Oh my gosh.

Thank you, Smith.

Have you ever roleplayed before?

I'd love to have you.

Run back.

That's what therapy is all about.

Run back.

Beautiful.

Oh wow.

I don't remember saying any of those things.

That was awesome.

That means go jet black.

I'll tell you that.

Oh no.

We gotta calm you down.

You get out of here.

Thank you too.

That was Comedy Bow Bow by Mack Lechner.

Thanks so much to Mack Lechner.

And guys, I want to thank you so much.

John, so great to have you back on.

Thank you for having me.

Is it official celebs are back?

I think celebs are back.

All right.

And Bridget, so great to have you.

It was mental to be here.

Absolutely devastating.

So sorry about the queen.

What?

What happened to us?

Oh, you don't even remember?

What?

Are you like a goldfish?

I can't.

You barely remember a conversation.

Is it okay?

Does something happen?

Oh, we'll talk about it after the show.

Sorry about Ted Lesser.

Okay.

Sorry about Ted Lesser as well.

And Steve, your eyes are black, your sweaty, your hands are curling up.

Get me out of here before I do something.

I won't regret.

Okay.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.

Bye.
