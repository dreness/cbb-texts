Well, it's that time of year again. Here we are at the end of the year, the Comedy Bang Bang Holiday Special.

We have a certain guest with his phone corner here.

Plus, very special guest that are gonna be dropping by all day. All of that and more. All on today!

♫♫♫♫ Jess Nods roasting on an open fire. Just kidding. Funny. Oh, you just kidding. There are a chest notes roasting on an open fire over there. Welcome to the show. Oh, I didn't come up with a catchphrase. I thought that was your catchphrase.

Oh, yeah, it should've been. Okay, Jess Nods roasting on an open fire. Just kidding. Thanks for that submission. Me.

You didn't come up with that. That's a song. Thanks for that submission, Net Kinkle. Mel Tormé.

Welcome to the show. I am Christmas saucerman. It is early morning here in LA. We're doing it. I think it should be hot cocoa man because it's like Christmassy. Hot cocoa man.

I like that. Thank you.

Hot cocoa man. Yeah. Hot cocoa man. Welcome to the show. I am hot cocoa man. Or hungstockingman. I am hungstockingman.

This is our holiday episode of Comedy Bang. This is our third in a row. We've been doing this for a while.

And we had a little sick of it. Yeah, enough already. We get it. Come on, son. I guess it's not really the sun. It's more the earth going around the sun. Well, it depends how you look at it. What other ways there to look at it? That's it.

Let me introduce my very special guest sitting directly in front of me. It's like a showdown here. You know him best as from the show. That's accurate. That's fair.

Yeah. I think it was intimidated as a slam, but really that's completely fair. But he's also a writer on Parks and Recreation. You loved his work on the Sarah Silverman program. And he's a stand up comedian who's his own right when he has the time.

Yeah. And when I was 15, I was in the sketch troupe in Houston, Texas called WAF. We'll act for food. And so you might know me from that if you're at that show we did. We'll act for food.

You were a sketch group that wanted to act. Yeah. Very first thoughty, that name. And you only did one show? I think we did two. Harris Whittles, by the way. Harris Whittles.

Two shows. Do you remember any of your sketches? Oh, they were pretty bad. One was like, well, one was called Death at a Poetry Reading. And it was like the Grim Reaper gets up and does a... Some slam? No, no, a guy gets up and starts talking about like, Death's One.

Death's warm embrace and is kind of shitting on the concept of death a little bit. Like, oh, I, you know, stay away from death. He's not afraid or... He is afraid of death.

And then Grim Reaper, played by me, is in the back and I go, hey, come on, man. I'm right here. You know, like, I was all offended. That was like...

That was 14, but... You were 14. Yeah. Do you still keep up with the WAFs?

Yeah, we're all kind of... One went on to be a Cirque du Soleil clown. Really? Yeah. In Whachow.

Zumanity? You wish. Zu wish. He, in Lorev in Vegas. Oh, okay. Great job. And then... Yeah, the others aren't doing anything anymore.

So he acts for actual money. He does. Not food. He probably buys food with the money that he...

Well, isn't... Yeah, that's predominantly what people are buying with the money that they get back there. You think so? What percentage of your paycheck goes to food? 98%. Wow.

My food is the 99. And the other guys, are they jealous of your success? Are they listening right now? No, because this isn't what they wanted to do. They... One has a food truck in Austin.

So he actually drives around with food. Yeah, he serves food for food.

So... And then... One works at Yahoo. So he... What is it?

What is it? Rights code for food. HTML for food. And... One...

What does he do for Yahoo? Did he do that exciting new look for Yahoo mail?

No, I don't think that was him. Do you use Yahoo mail? Why do you know about that? I mean, I used to, certainly. Yeah.

No, I don't think he did that. Okay.

I don't know what he does. So those guys, you fell out of favor with him. Did you break up? Was it just like, I'm not going to do this anymore? We all went to college.

Wait, you were in college at 14 years old? You were some sort of dookie-houser? We did a couple of shows and then just kind of didn't do it.

And then we all went to college. You know? I mean, that's a long gap you're talking about. That's four years before you went to college.

Actually, I feel in some of the blanks. Okay. Well, most...

I... Yes, we kind of stopped. It wasn't because we fell out of favor, but I started doing stand-up, I think, more.

You just started doing stand-up comedy? I focused on like...

At 14 or 15? This was like 16 or 17. I started writing stuff and going and hanging out at comedy clubs a lot.

But no, I think what was weird is that the whole... The sketch group was assembled by this woman who just put all these random people together.

She was like this. I don't know what she even did. Spengali.

Yeah. And we weren't like supposed to work together. It was just a weird mix of people kind of.

And we just stopped. What happened to the woman? She was killed by an off-duty police officer. This is not true.

I don't know what happened here. Most of the people, when you think about it, like most of your... Well, you're not old enough. But most of your teachers are probably dead.

We think about it. Miss Fiawoo just died. I heard. Oh, really? Yeah. I was surprised to hear she was still alive.

This lady, when I had her, I thought she was a little...

Well, Harris, it is the Christmas... Sorry. I apologize to your religion. I have no religion. Oh, okay. Did you lose it at some point?

Yeah. Yeah. I'm very... Michael Stipian in that way. Stipian.

Yeah. Well, a holiday show. Whatever. You can say Christmas.

I love Christmas. I know I seem Jewish, but I'm not. I just have allergies.

But it is the holiday show, and I can't let another moment go by without doing a holiday edition of Harris' phone corner.

♪ ♪ Alright, you know what that theme means. It means Harris has written jokes, much like when he was 16 years old, but this time on a cell phone, I don't think you were writing jokes on a cell phone back when you were 16.

No, I had a little pad. A little pad? Yeah. A little pad of butter. To match your little body. Yeah. Back when there was little, uh, blooned out like a pig.

He writes jokes on his phone. Yes. He then translates them into foam. Into phone. Into phone.

And then he reads them. And then we... I guess it's not part of the foam corner to critique them. It kind of is. It's not part of it to just shit on it outright. I think you going with an open mind?

Oh, I totally do. I do. More often than not. You're not into this stuff. I'm not into it. I don't know why I'm putting it out there.

And these are not... We should preface. These are not jokes that you would do in your stand-up act. If people go to see you... That's a good preface. I probably won't do these in my stand-up act. Unless they turn from foam into like a solid... I don't know... Punch foam. Punch foam. Yeah, sure.

So, but I mean, you are... What people don't know about you if they just know you from the shows, you are actually a good stand-up comedian. In my own right. And, uh, you're out there opening for Louis C.K. for Sarah Silverman. So you are technically adept at the craft.

Yeah, but I also like... Sometimes I really don't know what a good versus a bad joke is that I put in here until I gauge the faces of you. This is like a testing ground. Yeah.

Okay. Yeah. Test flight. Yeah. Sure.

All right. Well, in that vein or in that spirit, the Holy Spirit, Christmas spirit. Yeah.

Let's hear what you have for us here on Harris's foam. All right. I didn't like really plan on these being read on the Christmas episode, so I'm gonna try to make... I'm gonna try to Christmas them up.

So these were ones you've written over the past couple of months. Yeah. These are just regs. And, you know, if they turn jolly, then great.

Do you think it would be cool if your dick could smell things in December? I added it in December.

Um, let's talk about that for a minute. What? I guess it wouldn't. It probably wouldn't. You're only... Where do you put it that you would want to smell?

Unless you're Jim from American Pie. Unless you're out of Jim in American Pie? Yeah. If you're out of Jim in the movie American Pie, sure. Sure.

Sean Williams-Scottie works out a lot of insurance. Yeah, he must. But other than that, seems like it'd be stupid.

Uh, I like that one. Yeah. All right. I don't even know what it is, but thank you. It's all right. I like it. All right. Here's...

Where's your dick could cough? That's what I've always thought about. What if, like, all of a sudden, just you were in an elevator from down south of the yard?

Uh, I feel like that would be off-putting to those standing area. You think so? But what would you explain it? Would you, if someone was... What was that, if you're on an elevator? Would you go, might dick just cough?

Would it be like farts where you'd be embarrassed or would everyone's dick cough so much? Like, your dick would have the sniffles or something one day and everyone would just kind of go out of that because dick has the sniffles?

I don't think it would, like, smell. Like farts are embarrassing because it emits an unpleasant... That's true.

I mean, burps are not as embarrassing as farts because farts come from the butt.

But they're the second most embarrassing answer because they do smell. They do smell, but farts come from the butt.

So that's why they're funny. That's what I've always said.

So dick coughs come from the butt. Dick coughs come from the dick. And so I think... You know, dick coughs? I think they would still be funny because they come from the dick.

It would absolutely be funny. That is not what we're discussing here. I mean, it'd be the funniest thing that's ever happened.

But would it be embarrassing? Look, everyone farts. I don't know if in this reality you're the only one who's dick coughs.

No, I'm saying every male. Right. Then no. Other than people who have undergone sexual reassignment certain times.

I think anything that happens from the bathing suit area is embarrassing.

So even girls boobies? If one slips out, we call it a nip slip and put it on the news. So yeah, that's embarrassing.

The nightly news with Tom Brokaw? Yeah. Under a nip slip today.

So first time I tried to Tom Brokaw pressure. Well, you knocked it out of the part.

Alright, let's move on to phone corner number two.

Alright, this is a new character. It's called Harvey Dangerfield.

I'm not sick, but I'm not well. I get no respect. That's it.

Fans of the 90s and of the 80s will be satisfied with that joke.

Alright, this is... I'm not impressed by juggling, by people that juggle. I'm not impressed by it.

Well, what does your friend the clown do in that Cirque du Soleil show?

He actually is like an old school...

Frat Folly. Yeah, I don't... Yeah, like Comedial Arte. He's one of those dudes. He runs around and he looks surprised and then will fall on his face.

Is that all Comedial Arte is looking surprised?

Yeah, and then you fall off.

By the way, we're making huge surprise faces, which you cannot see, but it's really fine to us.

They can hear that.

But if you juggle, people are always busting that skill out, and they're like, oh, I didn't know I could do that.

It's like, well, okay, whatever, you learned how to do that.

I did, you did, and I didn't. You know, I could have...

That's not a thing I chose to learn.

So I don't care. It's not like you just naturally... You know what I'm saying?

I don't know about that. It is a skill that's... I mean, you could say Olympians we shouldn't be impressed with them because, oh, okay, you learned how to swim fast.

You raised a good point, actually. We shouldn't. Like, congratulations. You devoted your time to that. I didn't.

But if I did, then fucking I would be swimming.

Whatever, I'm just playing around with this stuff.

I think it's crazy that... Okay, for starters, toothpicks are fucking bullshit.

Okay. I think you can groove me. They don't work.

They don't work. Some people should have floss. Dental floss.

If you have something in your teeth, toothpicks will never get it out.

They're thicker than every tooth gap.

Right. Well, not some. Not Alfred E. Newman.

That's true. If he gets a very large piece of steak and one crevice, because the rest... He only has the one, actually.

He has a few crevices.

In terms of teeth, he really just has the one in front.

That's true. Of course, I haven't really taken a look at his bottom teeth.

We don't see Alfred E. Newman's bottom teeth a lot.

You just can't. You don't.

No, I haven't either.

I've actually never seen him non-animated. I don't know if that's...

No, I mean, that's a good point. When you just see him around, you're not really looking at his bottom teeth.

Yeah, exactly.

I mean, okay, so you're suggesting that on the counter, on the hostess counter...

A big spool.

Or host, I guess that was sort of sexist of me.

Right.

Yeah.

I think that you would just... A big spool and you would just kind of...

Take? Yeah, just instead of toothpicks, it's floss.

You unspool, be courteous. Don't take too much.

And then there's a little bucket there where you dispose of it.

Do you think that restaurants don't do that because it's a lot like napkins?

You know how like restaurants now sort of parcel out the napkins?

Because everyone takes more than they need of everything.

That's true.

You know, like you really only, unless you're at a barbecue joint, you only need two napkins.

Yeah, that's true.

But everyone takes five or six or eight.

Right.

Because you never know.

You never do know.

And you don't want to be flossing there right by the host counter.

Mm-hmm.

Is host non-gender specific, by the way? Can I get away with saying host counter?

You can't. Okay, sorry. My apologies.

But you don't want to do it right then, so you'd probably take off a chunk for the car.

Yeah.

You think this has something to do with why restaurants haven't done this?

Yeah, because of waste.

Because of waste.

People will take too much floss.

Correct.

Bizarre.

How bizarre is OMC once said?

All right, moving on.

Last one?

Or do you have a few more?

Give me a few more.

Okay, a few more.

It's not a few more.

Here we go.

I'm starting a campaign to change bygones into something.

Everyone's always trying to let them be bygones.

I want to...

Moving on to the next one.

Downhill and uphill are both bad.

It's weird that both mean a bad thing.

If like, oh, it's all downhill or, oh, it's all uphill.

Those are both shitty.

Right.

It's all uphill from here, I guess.

That means, oh, it's going to be challenging.

Yeah.

But at least it doesn't mean that at the end of it, you're going to fail.

You're at the bottom.

Yeah.

Right.

No, I see your point.

Yeah, it just seems like one way should be good.

Okay.

Two more.

It is a two more.

Okay.

Two more and then Harris' phone corner will be closed for the year.

Yeah.

All right, so two more and make them great.

I can't choose to do that.

I can only say what they are.

I think it's insane that car radios exist, period.

All it is, it's only a distraction.

Like, oh, I'm bored driving this like two ton piece of metal.

You should be able to do another activity.

I should take my mind off of it.

And that car companies are like, yes, this is a standard thing.

This distraction will put in your car.

It should be, we should only be driving going, whoa.

Oh, I'm going to hit some time.

Yeah.

So not a joke.

Not a joke.

I'm not joking.

You're a hater.

That's pretty good.

Is that your Jimmy Pardo?

All right.

All right, one more.

Here we go.

I did want to throw in that Steve impression from Sex in the City.

Oh, yeah.

By the way, you have not made many of these jolly.

I have to say.

Oh, fuck.

You're right.

The car radio, give a car radio to a loved one for Christmas.

All right, so you got one more.

Oh, you want to do your Steve impression?

Steve impression.

And then, well, first I'll just say, OK.

You're really stringing these up.

I know.

It's the last one of the year, though.

It's a clearing house.

I know.

This is my last time doing this ever.

This is Steve from Sex in the City.

All right, here we go.

It's all right, Miranda.

You can out take Brady.

You got a Brooklyn.

I love you.

I know we're having problems in the movie.

The first one.

I love how you watched my mother for me.

You gave her a bath.

All right, great.

Oh.

And now, is this the last?

Can we eat?

Yeah.

And this is like a little more like blue than most foam corner.

Blue meaning sad or blue meaning?

Blue the color.

Oh, OK, literally blue.

No, blue meaning like explicit.

Explicit.

So your muffs for the children.

Yeah.

For Christmas, get your children your muffs.

I'm just trying to Christmas it up.

Yep.

Will this one be Christmas-y, by the way?

Will this tie into Christmas?

Will this be jolly?

You can do this thing that I'm going to talk about on Christmas if you want.

Great.

But when someone like, and I don't have friends like this, but there are people that talk about like, do you met this girl?

And she was like down for whatever.

That just means like ask fucking.

That's all that can mean.

That's the only other thing.

Everyone's always like, she would trust me anything.

Like, there's only, you know what I'm saying?

There's not much else you can do.

Yeah, I guess I see that.

Like what it.

BLEEP HE LAUGHS ♪ Here's this phone corner, yeah, come on, hamsters phone corner, what, yo, come on ♪ ♪ Hamsters phone on a phone, give the phone, it's a phone corner ♪ Yay!

Let's close up the phone corner for another year.

We'll see you in 2012.

All right, let's go to a break when we come back.

We'll have more comedy back, back.

HE LAUGHS ♪ MUSIC ♪ Santa works all day in his workshop, making a lot of things and toys.

Then one day he hops in his sleigh to bring them to the girls and boys.

Santa's just as nice as he could be.

There's just one fucking thing that worries me.

If it doesn't snow on Christmas, how's that is gonna use that sleigh?

In case of rain, would there be a train that'll speed him on his way?

If it doesn't snow this Christmas, how's that is get around to us?

Say he breaks down on his way to town, would they let him use a bus?

I sent them a nice long letter, and I hope it's not in vain.

I really would feel much better if the fat fuck blew a plane.

Now they say he got a reindeer for the sleigh he's driving here.

But how the fuck see go if it doesn't snow on Christmas?

This year, hey good boys.

Ahh, Joe Pesci doing his holiday classic from his terrible album.

It is Comedy Bank Bank.

I'm here with Harris Whittles.

I did say his name.

I believe to introduce him.

I did, yes.

And you know who he is.

And we're just rounding out the year here.

It's been a great year on CBB.

So basically what's going to happen on this show is it's just going to be me and Harris for a couple hours.

And we're just going to do it, except when a guest drops by, which we have one who just came by right now.

Oh my god.

And he sat down in the chair.

We haven't seen him in a while, but you know him from stage and screen, mainly screen adaptations of his stage work, and which he is not in.

But he is the writer of such musicals as Phantom of the Opera, Roller Skate Train, Cats and Jellicle Cats, and also Joseph and Jesus.

And please welcome Andrew Lloyd Webber.

No, hello, everyone up there.

Greetings, God's big thank you.

Thank you for your traditional greeting to me, but don't you want to say hello to our other guests?

Who's this chap now?

Hi, sir.

My name's Harris Whittles.

I'm a huge fan.

What?

Harris Whittles.

So that can't be right.

It is.

No such name.

Oh, I know.

Take it up with the folks, huh?

First of all, your first, your Christian name appears to be a surname.

That's bang out of order.

You could true.

And then your last name seems to get Whittles.

No.

Yeah, I know.

Yeah.

You're having me on.

No, I'm not having you on.

I'm not.

That simply can't be a surname that people would use.

I know.

It can't have survived to 2011.

It has.

And you know what's funny?

I don't know if this funny.

I do.

I have a sentence.

Harris Whittles.

I know.

There is.

So it's spelled Harris like W-H-I-T-T-L-E-N.

No, I guess just only in.

You lied sir.

I'm sorry.

You lied.

Oh.

I didn't lie.

You're a false friend.

That was a fun little fact.

How dare you?

Was that an FF or an FF?

A fun factor, a false friend?

That was a follow Friday.

Or a follow Friday.

That hashtag FF.

That hashtag is everyone.

Are you on Twitter?

Of course I am.

Of course you are.

What are some of your famous tweets?

Oh, I remember one time I tweeted.

Yes.

That is trying to recall.

Are you always bringing up his phone?

It's so many.

I mean I'm crazy.

Bringing up his account.

I know you RT several people.

You're constantly RTing Tim Rice.

Yes.

Tim Rice.

That's the way we communicate now.

Through RTs.

We don't speak in person.

We never chat on the telephone.

And so you're retweeting each other to communicate with each other.

Seems like a feedback loop.

It's just sort of a what?

Just like if you're just retweeting then no new things are being said.

I must say you're making me very angry.

I don't know what it is about you.

I know.

He makes the listeners angry too.

He's...

Well that's not surprising.

There's something about you that you seem on the face of you.

You seem like a pleasant enough young man.

But there's something underneath that's infuriating.

Yeah.

You make my mouth feel like it's filled with iron filing.

Yep.

Spitting blood.

I'm so angry.

Sorry.

Our lord.

Yes, thank you.

Our lord.

I got promoted.

What was the ceremony like in your promotion?

You know it's a private intimate affair.

It's just me.

Just family and friends.

All of England and everyone.

You are a friend to all of England.

I like to think so.

You are one of England's greatest treasures.

Thank you for saying so.

Although I will say America has really taken to your place.

Here in America there are many pockets of popularity that I enjoy.

Of course New York City is a great white way.

Why was it called that I wonder?

I mean it has nothing to do with...

Oh it's only white people.

What allowed to be on the stage?

Yes.

And it was great.

I'm not saying that that's a policy that should exist now but back then it was appropriate for the time.

So great.

Yes it was great.

Wonderful.

I'm joking.

How dare you?

We're off on like so many wrong feet here.

I'm wearing an urban cape and a medal.

I know.

And a sweater.

A very lovely holiday sweater.

I hate you.

Yes this is a gift from one of my wives.

I can't remember which one.

Sarah Brightman perhaps?

Let's see that one.

Okay yes.

I lose count after a while.

One of the many beautiful women that you have.

Yes I've got an eye for the horse flesh don't you do.

Oh god.

Why does that disgust you?

I don't know.

What are your holiday plans man?

Ask is that two personal questions?

No it is not two personal questions.

It's just personal enough.

Great.

Every year for the Christmas holidays.

That's what you celebrate.

Yeah I celebrate Christmas.

I'm a Christian.

Twelve days of it or?

Twelve days of it.

Boxing day of course.

Feast of the Epiphany.

When the wise man finally reached the baby Jesus.

Quanza.

Is that one of the twelve?

It's not one of the twelve days of Christmas.

It should make it 13 now.

It's actually an annex of Hanukkah I believe.

Oh yes.

One of those eight crazy nights.

That I'm Sandler talked about.

Seven crazy days.

And a bit in his popular movie if he called it that I think.

So day time doesn't seem as crazy.

No no.

Night time that's where the freaks come out then.

I would love for you to write a musical about that topic.

I know you would.

That very topic.

The topic of freaks coming out.

Freaks coming out right.

Well you know I tried for y'all to adapt the movie Chud into a musical.

About the cannibalistic cubidoid under crowd dwellers.

And were you going to use the song the freaks come out at night in your Chud musical?

Well I was going to knock it off.

Oh yes.

I was going to just alternate lyrics or new music.

No lyrics and then alter the music slightly just within a couple notes so that I couldn't be sued.

I'm trying to imagine what's going on.

Trying to avoid a re-paca junior situation.

Yes and a George Harrison.

Oh yes.

Did you see that documentary?

I did not.

I saw it sir.

Thank you.

Lord I see me properly.

Lord.

Well I will also accept so because it's a term of respect.

I'm really walking on eggshells around this guy.

Doped.

Was that part of the documentary George Harrison walking around on eggshells?

Yes it was part of his spiritual journey.

Yeah.

This is very crackpot swami.

Yeah crackpot swami.

You have to walk on eggshells in order to achieve an absence of fear.

It's not really that hard to do.

Yeah you are allowed to break them.

Yeah but I mean they would maybe poke into the underside of your feet a little bit.

Yes but not really.

It's not like walking on glass.

What's that?

Hold on a second.

This wiggles person has something to say.

Well now that we've shined a spotlight on it's the worst sentence.

It contributes nothing.

I just said the bottom.

Much like yourself.

Yeah.

Much like I said the bottom is a feeder tougher than you think.

Do we need the Harris' phone corner theme for that.

So what are your holiday plans?

We are travel.

I used to spend Christmas in space with Sir Richard Bronson.

Of course.

But you were up in a balloon with him at one point.

Yes yes.

And we have a tempestuous friendship.

It's not easy.

It's not easy with peers of the realm you know.

I would imagine a peers Morgan as well.

It's not easy with him at all.

Do you consider him a peer?

Only by his first name.

Right.

Yes one cannot help but it gives it a him a peer because his name is peers.

What is the cutoff of like one cannot help but gives it a him two peers.

Pierce Brosnan.

How dare you.

Plus he's Irish into the bargain.

Wait a minute.

What was space like?

That is a great question.

Actually you've redeemed yourself with that.

What is space like?

It's hard to describe to commoners no offense intended.

No offense taken.

That's surprising because there should have been some.

There's something about being in the inky blackness of the airless void of outer space.

No one can hear you scream there.

No no one but you're tempted to scream all the same.

I think because of that expression that you want to scream and scream and scream and catch someone hearing you like aha I heard you're out.

You can hear me.

I do exist.

I am a person.

Take heart.

Boy.

I'm going to let that one slide.

Not good though.

End of move.

Not good.

Yes so there's something that makes you feel very small I think because everything around you is very big.

Well I imagine the planets are big I think.

Yes well you know they're right there.

When you go up the planets are right there.

And they're just all crowding around you and there's maa there's Venus the one with the rings.

It's like a oh do you mean the Lord of the Rings?

Yes the Lord of the Rings is up there.

Yes J.R.R.

Tolkien himself was transferred he ascended into planetary state.

He's sort of he's an omnipresent presence isn't he up there just sort of looking out over everyone.

J.R.R.R.

Yes he watches over us all.

Who's Shah J.R.R.

Tolkien by the way.

We still haven't found out.

It's a mystery that it goes to this day.

Oh we never found that out.

He had so many books left in him if only he hadn't been murdered.

Thank God it happened.

He would have kept on writing those blasted books.

Oh God we would have had like eight more movies that we'll go watch.

No thank you.

Plastid drove people to go to New Zealand.

How do the two of you celebrate?

Well we of course have Christmas crackers.

We pull those apart and see if there's a prize inside.

Usually it's more medals.

Poppers what are those called?

You know there's poppers.

But poppers also has another meaning here in your country doesn't it?

John nitrate.

John Poppers, Emil nitrate.

Robert Popper from England.

Yes.

What about?

Yes indeed.

Very very funny lad.

I'm just free associating right now.

It's fun to do.

It is.

Robert Johnson the blue singer who sold his soul to the devil.

Nothing from Harris.

Well Robert I'm just kidding I don't.

I try to.

I know I'm supposed to.

Did you buy the box set?

No.

It just doesn't sound good to me.

Well thanks for free associating.

So you're up in space.

You do Christmas crackers.

Christmas crackers.

What are Christmas crackers?

That's the little things that you pull and they go boom.

You would have made it or pulled either side of this.

It's like a wishbone but.

Yes.

Sort of wrapped in paper this little explosive inside.

It makes those little.

Popping sound.

Okay.

That sounds fun.

And then I'm trying to tell you what it is but you're telling me.

But okay I think I got enough.

Well why don't we tell each other what it is.

I think it's a.

Yes it's a you pull.

And then there's a prize inside it pops.

Yes.

Merry Christmas.

Christmas pudding.

Of course.

Space pudding.

You're really so it has to be dehydrated first.

Yes it's frozen.

It's like astronaut food.

Okay.

And it's just a powder that you swirl around.

In your mouth.

Your own saliva.

Yes your own saliva.

Oh the truth.

God willing.

In space there is no saliva.

Your mouth gets very dry.

Very dry up there.

I don't know what it is.

I think it's space.

Maybe just space itself.

Yeah yeah I think.

Yeah I'm not sure.

But we like to go into a very fast orbit and try to catch places where it's snowing.

Just look at the snow from above.

Mmm.

Falling down below.

That's oh wow I didn't know you could do that.

Yes well it's you know how space at first when you're up there you feel very small.

You're very humbled.

But then when you're able to watch snow falling on a particular region of the globe then you feel very powerful as if you wanted the almighty God himself.

Like JR Tolkien himself.

JR R.

Well.

Well I'm getting glared at from my lord.

I took your, I, Harris this is very confounding because when I look at you I see a very personable young man.

Yeah something about you.

Very polarizing.

Well I wish I had horse blinkers on so I could just concentrate on the skull trick and not even see Harris out of my peripheral room.

Well Lord ALW that sounds fantastic but you're not doing it this year.

Not this yeah this year I'm going to the desert taking a retracing the steps of Colonel T.E.

Lawrence.

His Christmas journey.

Also Mr. T was there.

Mr. T.

And Lawrence were both there.

And E from Entourage.

You're the food gang.

Kevin Connolly.

Sorry.

No it's the other E from Entourage.

The one played by Alec Guinness.

Sir Alec Guinness.

Well he's dead now so we don't have to.

That's true.

Plus does a lord have to call someone sir.

No heavens no.

No I didn't think so.

No I don't wrangle the sirs all the nights.

Well ALW that's all the time we have for this segment but can you stick around or are you stick around.

Stick around.

Please do.

We of course have to take a break at this point.

Of course.

It was preordained.

When we come back.

This is a break to pay the pie pie pie.

It was.

Gotta pay the bills.

You know how many bills.

Well you've got the skills to do so.

I try to act for food here.

So let's take a break.

When we come back we will have more guests.

More Comedy Bank.

We'll be right back.

I'm a Christmas tree.

Everybody hangs their ornaments on me.

I'm a Christmas tree.

People throw me out on New Year's Eve.

Oh Santa Claus.

He breaks lots of laws.

He tries passes.

He breaks and enters.

He travels all around the world without a valid passport.

I'm a Hanukkah bush.

I'm a lot like a Jewish Christmas tree.

I'm not.

You see them.

Hey welcome back Comedy Bank Bank.

I'm a Hanukkah bush.

I don't know who it is.

Hello it's me Billy Crystal.

Billy Crystal.

In the studio.

Yeah.

Here I am.

How are you?

The Oscar host himself.

Well you know when they come a colon?

I must serve my duty.

You know what I mean?

Might I say Billy?

Yeah.

You look marvelous.

I remember his whole autobiography.

I do not.

The title was marvelous.

Marvelous.

I got a lot of mileage off that word.

Marvelous.

Say it like.

Not marvelous.

Marvelous.

Say it like you used to say it though.

You want me to?

I do.

Do you really?

I really do.

Good.

Do you really want me to?

Christmas tree.

Oh Christmau, how do you think?

Do you really really want me to?

I really really really do.

Well Scott.

You.

Runk.

Marvelous.

Yeah.

Marvelous.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Oh I love that since 1985.

Yeah.

And what was that character again?

Fernando.

Based upon Fernando.

Fernando.

Who was the name of the title?

I don't remember his fucking last day.

I don't remember it.

Very angry.

Something based on your childhood right?

People always ask me that I keep I'm sorry.

I swore but people keep asking me what his last name was and I used to know but hey.

You can see.

Get older.

I don't have time.

I got to prepare my whole stick.

Oh you're very busy.

Oh wait I thought you meant for your impending demise.

No no no.

Hello I'm hosting the Oscars smart ass.

There's no impending demise happening.

I'm so sorry.

If there's a demise happening to anybody it's well.

Who?

It's well.

Joe Piscopo.

Oh no he isn't he dead?

Didn't he die?

Oh dear.

No.

Mr. Jimmy Cox.

Saturday night.

Murphy.

Mr. Murphy.

Oh.

Yeah.

Yeah Eddie Murphy you're taking Eddie Murphy's place.

Yeah.

I mean they always wanted me.

Yeah.

From day one.

From day one they always wanted me.

Sometimes I'm like you know give it to somebody else.

This was one of those years.

You said give it to Eddie Murphy.

I said give it to Eddie Murphy.

I'll be here when he fucks up somehow.

Well I you know I wasn't thinking that he would fuck up.

Oh okay.

Yeah I you know just in case.

He didn't really.

He didn't.

Well he aligned himself with with Brett Retner.

Yeah with a guy who's completely anti rehearsing.

Is he?

Yeah that did you not hear it?

I don't like that.

Why you're hired?

He said no we want the king back.

I don't read the articles.

I don't keep that negativity in my life.

When you read playboy do you just look at the pictures?

Ah wow.

Don't tell my oh hey.

Hey.

Although people are constantly asking you what was Fernando's last name.

You didn't manage to hear anything about why Brett Retner was lit.

I try not to talk to people in that way.

I hear you there.

You know.

Yes indeed.

Once you strike up that conversation.

You know.

Where does it end?

Yeah I'm having lunch.

I'm having lunch.

Where does it end?

Dinner.

Yeah and then you know an interview.

Supper.

Maybe.

Interview is usually no better than ask me those types of questions.

They just give me the floor and let me run.

Oh is that what I'm supposed to do here?

Kind of.

Okay well by all means is run.

Do you want to rehearse some of your Oscar material or what do you want to do?

Oh this will be a treat.

Let me just open the floor to you and you can do whatever you like.

Well.

Here we go.

Okay I've got a few things.

You know.

Who I can't read.

Oh boy this is going to be a treat.

I'm going to let you run.

A private comedy concert.

I like to what what do you think is the best picture of the year.

This is how I work.

I took a picture of my dog that was.

Come on what's the best movie that you've seen.

Oh no limited movie.

Yeah.

Have you taken any movies of your dog?

I took a really great eye movie.

I said it to Weebie Clubbin.

The Ice Cube song and it's him just walking down the street all tough and it's like Weebie Clubbin.

I saw that.

That was really funny.

That's very funny.

I thought you said you sent it to Weebie Clubbin.

I didn't know what that was.

I sent it to Weebie Clubbin.

That's very funny.

Put somebody like me right next to you dog and that's a major motion picture right there.

Okay.

Let's get back on track.

What are we talking about?

What's your favorite film of the year?

What's you guys favorite films of the year?

I haven't seen everything yet.

I usually wait until February to make that decision.

All right.

Well pick one that you haven't seen that you think might get a lot of accolades.

5050 is going to get a lot of buzz.

5050.

I think the War Horse.

That movie was 50% amazing and 50% charming.

There you go.

Sorry, I didn't mean to stuff on that.

50% you're warming 50% charming.

You're taking the free.

That's how I work.

Yes.

I replaced Amazing with something more specific.

Charming.

So you start with one word and then you instantly rewrite and come up with another one.

Yeah.

And then I throw that to Vlanch and he says, Hey, I'm going to roam with that and do a bunch of stuff off that.

So then at the end of the day, I've got 10 solid 5050 jokes from Vlanch.

How much did I just that I just choose from?

Like a kid in a candy store.

Man, how much of the material do you generate yourself and how much is turned over to this and the land?

You know, it's a group effort.

So I'm generating it at the end of the day.

I'm saying it.

So in a way, I'm rewriting it because it's being recreated through my mouth and going out to the people.

So once it goes out to the people, everybody thinks it's mine.

So why don't we just keep it that way?

Harris, do you want to write for the Oscars?

Anymore.

Oh, you do.

You know, I like that show, Parks and Recreation.

You maybe you could do anything.

Take it easy on me, Billy.

You know, I wrote, I wrote Greg Daniels about, you know, me coming on as like some black janitor.

Could we have a little taste of what that would sound like?

Yeah, you know, let's say Amy Poehler.

May I cast it?

Harris shall play the role of Amy Poehler who plays whatever she plays on the show.

What role will I do as saying?

Why don't you be the mustache fellow?

Oh, he runs on.

I'll take a word for it.

Billy, I'm going to play the wise, if I may, the wise black, the shadow tall.

Yeah, yes.

And action.

Hey, you got to get all those raccoons out of this park.

Yeah, yeah.

They're raccoons.

They've been all over this park.

Can you dig that?

I knew that you could.

Yeah.

And the other day I was playing my horn in the middle of the park.

I'll just sit this one out.

No, would you say?

No, no, no, no, you go ahead.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Anytime I try.

Anytime I run Swanson want to say something, just I get run over.

So you just go ahead.

No, no, no, no.

Is this the character's hogging?

Yes, of course.

The show sounds very improvised.

Ron Swanson, you're sensitive.

You're sensitive, Ron Swanson.

Can you dig that?

I knew that you could.

So anyway, the other day I was sitting in the park.

I was blowing on my horn, going, Baba Du Duis, Baba Du Duis.

Then all of a sudden this raccoon came out, grabbed my horn, and started going, Baba Du Du Duis, Baba Du Duis.

You're playing your horn?

I say raccoon.

Now only are you playing my horn.

You're playing my horn, a wacky.

What?

Can you dig that?

I knew that you could.

Man, I stopped you there just for one.

Yeah, see?

As much as I admire your character work.

And I've seen you do the solo Jazz Man.

It's a classic character.

I know it is.

I'm saying that.

Right.

I noticed that now with your interacting with another actor, you're not allowing people to answer the question, can you dig it?

You're automatically assuming an answer to your character.

It's a rhetorical question.

You're kind of steamrolling.

Because I know that there's steamrolling in the character.

I'm so wise it's impossible that they couldn't see my point.

Well then why are you asking in the first place?

Just to wake them up to the fact that they're digging it and they should feel good about themselves for that.

That's why people love that character.

So the character is saying to the other characters, you already understand what I said.

It's just that you can dig it, not can you dig it.

You know, the same year that Michael Richards' career was destroyed because of what he did in that comedy club to those black people, he said a very bad word to people who were you to this but you haven't heard of the Brett Ratner story.

Oh, oh, you mean the, oh what Brett Ratner said?

I thought you meant what I said.

Oh, that Brett Ratner made fun of the gays.

He made a reference to the gays in his anti-rehearsal-red.

I totally misunderstood.

Oh yeah, yeah, no, yeah, rehearsals are for, I'm moving on, you know, maybe I need another cup of listening anyway through that one to launch.

I should.

Any little punch up on that one.

That same year, comic relief six or whatever it was.

I did.

My favorite one by the way.

I did that character as a Katrina victim.

And it's right.

I did a long long long.

And it's very tasteful.

Richards was destroyed.

I was celebrated.

Why?

Because I make people feel good.

You have pathos in what you do.

The one thing definitely happened.

I'm not so sure about the other.

People feel, people feel, they feel grateful that they get to, you know, witness such a wise, likable character.

What typically are the things that people say to you after you do the Jasmine character?

I'm sure people have various responses to it.

Well, this one time I was doing a show and a public enemy was playing it.

They happened to be in the back.

Okay.

And I went back and Professor Grief told me you fucking asshole.

The Minnesota public.

I should.

Yes.

I should slit your throat right now.

And what I took that to mean from him was that the fact that he was even talking to me because I know they don't, they don't usually talk to a lot of white people.

Who's they?

Public enemy.

I'm always saying that I had hit a nerve and he just didn't really know how to talk to me because he's so used to being angry at, you know, people of our skin color.

Right.

All right.

Well, Billy, this is all very fascinating, but we have to wrap it up here with your segment.

But is there anything you want to say to the people for the holidays?

Watch the Oscars.

Not that I got to tell you that.

That's not really a holiday greeting, holiday specific, but can you stick around or do you want to stick around for a little bit?

Sure.

We got to take a break and move on to our next guest, but this is a comedy bang bang.

This is a high cokeman and we'll be right back.

Yeah.

Christmas 89.

This be Dookie from the Dookie crew.

And this is our amounts from Lola Bunkershire.

I'm going to tell you all some shit about all Saint Nick.

Oh, I love getting shit told to me.

Till let's do this.

Twas a night before Christmas at the fucking door pole.

Santa was kicking it with Rudolph and a ho.

They were drinking Alize and reading for no mask with all of a sudden Santa reaching to his back.

They were singing.

They were shy.

They were so glad.

Cuz Santa had the biggest dick anybody ever had.

Santa got a big dick.

He flung it down the chimney.

He hit the milk and cookie plate.

That shit's as big as wind.

As we sat around an aw Santa says you want to touch it.

The hope said no.

Admunch rather suck it.

He put this in a mouth that went right through her head, but she kept on belating even though she was dead.

Santa got a big dick.

It even killed two children.

Santa got a big dick like the parliament building.

Comedy Bank Bank.

Welcome back.

We're here with Harris Whittles of course.

Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber Billy Crystal.

Hey.

The only one who said hello.

I don't know why the others didn't.

I didn't get a chance.

Breezing right.

Of course I assume we're not going to hear from Harris because we would.

But then I was about to say something.

And then Billy Crystal jumped right in.

Billy Crystal.

We have a very special guest who just mosey didn't.

I don't quite know how else to describe the way he walks.

What?

What is that?

Where's that coming from?

Holy shit.

Look down there.

Game show.

I'm a new show.

Little Geralt bless my body.

I'm a bad man.

You show.

You like a parent from the sky.

How did you get up there?

I'm scared.

I can't put right up here.

Little Gary, we have seen neither Hyde nor Hair of you for about nine months now.

You know that I am working as an intern.

Working as an intern?

Yes.

I don't see that far as.

Down at pseudo apartment rags.

Down at pseudo-apartment rags.

I'm working as an intern for the drug cartels.

Oh, okay.

One of the drug cartels.

Yeah, yeah, I'm getting college credit.

So it's an unpaid position.

Cash write games here.

I get two points to see what it is.

Community college.

And I get to decide.

I get to get audio ads for him.

Adopt.

I drop.

Sometimes you'll just have me deliver ahead to somebody.

It's mostly different heads.

As a warning.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Like, don't make me a college.

Here's somebody's head.

I don't know.

They ask little Gary.

I'm firm.

How are these just Lord Webber?

How are these heads received by the recipients?

Do they?

What was that typical?

Do they have to sign for them?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

First you got to sign for like wine.

You got to get a huge window.

Every time you give somebody a head.

You think they're going to be pretty surprised.

I just say, I just say.

I say, yeah.

If Brad Pitt has told me to agree, Bill, you'm crystal?

Yeah, sorry.

I just had to.

I totally forgot Billie Cricket with you.

Yeah, I'm right here.

I'm just I'm.

I'm in gross.

You're amazing to me.

Let's get some kind of facial scrub.

Why are you so shiny?

Me?

Kyle, mighty.

No, a normal man is that shiny.

It looks like a candle.

When you're a star, you're a star.

You can't help it.

Stars do shine, do they?

Stars shine.

I'm going to come back to you.

And I'm shining bright.

So, little Gary, you've been in down in Mexico.

We're going to the drug cartels for college credit.

Yeah, I got two points.

Two points?

I didn't know you were still in school.

What's the total number of points you're going for?

I think it's like you do.

But it's a good, super orange.

It's pretty good liberal arts.

I didn't realize you were no longer working with the rodeos.

No, no, no, no.

Do it.

At certain point, a man's been trampled as many times as he wants to be.

You know?

Mine is zero.

You mean a partial trample?

You know, it's fixed with you.

I can't tell if moving from the rodeos to the cartels is to step up or a step down.

Maybe a lateral move.

Kind of up like up the nose.

Like uphill or downhill, right, Harris?

Right, both bad.

We talked about that in the phone corner.

Oh, OK.

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

The cartel probably pays better.

Oh, no.

He stood up and fell asleep.

Oh, no.

This was so boring.

It got so boring for his life.

What are the rules of little Geralt?

What are we to do?

When he's...

You have to sit and sit him down and he can only sleep standing up.

I see.

But it's not so much that he can only sleep standing up that any time he stands he falls asleep.

He has to be having nightmares because they don't trample me.

The blood finally circulates and is able for him to...

Hey, so small.

Oh my God.

He's a talent.

Oh my God.

America's greatest comedic treasure.

Oh my God.

America's greatest comedic treasure.

You're fucking free.

Who will be the most?

Oh.

I'm okay.

It was Billy.

Okay, I'm coming up on a dance for all the fighting.

Oh God.

My fucking skin's flapping all over the place.

Oh.

It's like your circumcision.

Oh God.

Bingo.

That made me feel better.

You see?

Yeah, you're so gushing blood though.

I don't...

Even if you feel better.

It's okay.

The spirit of the land swatches over the soul.

I got about ten more minutes and then I got to run to a hospital.

Until then, I think I can ignore the pain.

I have apologized.

Little Gary, I understand you brought a song that you wanted to...

Yeah, you know that I'm kind of like a...

You know I mean...

I joined the orchestra like a cult.

Oh, I...

Is it so?

In Mexico or somewhere else?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

We're lexicult.

Yeah, it's gonna make sense.

It's gonna make sense.

We're just trying to...

Yeah, we're like hardcore Jesus people.

Oh.

Yeah.

You know what we got?

Your two passions don't seem to reconcile.

Oh, please trust me.

The reason I got into the cult was after...

You know it's a long day of delivery heads.

Yeah, you really got to turn to something.

You just feel dirty.

You got to look within.

You can't take a look inside.

So I thought that people forgot what Christmas is ever...

What Christmas is all about?

You need to go...

Yeah, you already did it in the time that I tried to force it out!

Erm, Mr.

Oh God.

I don't feel good.

You're getting lightheaded.

Oh, I don't feel good at all.

Hang on, I think I just died for a second.

Oh yeah.

No, I'm alive!

Okay.

Yeah, so this is the song that I wrote for the people in my cult.

Okay, well let's hear it.

Any setup you need to...

It's important to give back.

Yeah, we give back to the cult.

Yeah.

So let's hear this song, Lil' Gary.

Is it what's it for?

Yeah, we're watching it awhile.

Don't give me a head to deliver.

The cult will?

No, no, no, the cartel.

Oh.

I can't deliver no head.

I'm going to leave it on the bus here.

Oh.

I've heard about this rash of bus heads.

Yes.

Some of those are me.

Some of those.

Yeah, I just...

You don't always have this stomach.

Alright, so let's hear the song, Lil' Gary.

What do we got here?

Yeah, Lil' Gary.

Oh, Lil' Gary.

What do you think of that?

You are the type you're gonna be getting, I think.

Oh, the better, I think.

You are the happy, very true, isn't it?

You can't be stuck after my kids.

No, it's the best, man.

You can't get them back to me.

I can't do it.

You can't get them back to me.

I can't get them back to me.

You can't get them back to me.

I'm jealous.

I don't mind saying that.

You'll probably steal it later.

Probably.

Lou Gary, thank you so much for driving by and adding some jolly holiday cheer to this dreadful, dreadful time of year.

Hey, yeah, tell you that they replaced my heart.

Oh, you did not tell us that.

I thought I'd heard something about it.

But I'm fresh my memory.

In the Washington Post, I think I read something.

The cartel, I had passed away briefly.

The cartel has a gift.

You know, do everything you're waiting for, guys?

Do I know the Wizard of Oz?

Yeah.

Okay, I had that happen, but for real.

Okay, where they replaced your, you didn't have a heart make but what happened?

Yeah, it took a heart as a dog.

You were like the, uh...

Here, look, it's on the outside.

You can see it.

Oh, oh, oh, I thought there was a broom.

Oh, God.

You're having ducky bullets.

That's a dog heart.

It's not even in a bag or anything.

It's just this heart.

No, you can't, it can't, it can't, it can't encase it.

Well, little Gary, you're proving that we need a little more heart here at Christmas and thank you so much.

I know where I can get you one.

Okay.

Yeah, I'd love to talk to you after the show.

I think Billy might need one soon.

Yeah, he just got to speak in a medical attention.

I, uh, I gotta, I think I have to go to the beach.

I'm going to leave.

Yeah, no, and it's been a big problem.

It's probably a mistake.

Probably.

It's a little Gary and Billy.

Thank you so much for coming by.

Thank you.

We appreciate it.

Andrew, wait, were you sick at around?

If you'll have me.

I certainly will in Harris, of course, we know you're here.

Thank you, my wife, it gives me a...

Alright, let's go to the guys.

Wait, little Gatorode has a question to Christmas question.

This is a weird, weird, weird, weird to get a kiss from you.

Not at all.

Oh, no.

Let me just climb up.

Oh, he is.

Scomping up.

He's scomping up to my shoulder again.

Here we go.

Merry Christmas, little Gareld.

Can't be a cat, can't be a one.

This is like that story.

Which one?

The story of the really weird midget.

You know the one.

Austin Powers.

Ah.

You know, Dr. Evil, Austin Powers too.

Yeah, I think it's my dog heart stop.

That was like...

Oh, no, I squeezed it too hard.

Oh, he's dead.

He's...

Oh, Billy is dying too.

I am following.

Quick squeeze in like a bagpipe.

Here.

Rehearsals.

Ah.

No.

For faggots.

No!

We'll be right back.

Let me see.

We have a scarf for Skywalker, right?

Yes.

And perfume for the princess.

Yes.

What about Man Solo?

Couldn't we get him here?

All right, no, not good.

That is one big problem.

No one.

Couldn't we get him a comb?

He gave him a comb last year.

What can you get?

A wooden fur creme, but when he already owns a comb.

What can you get?

A harry for a parry kinder friend like that.

Take a comb.

What can he done need?

A tie clip.

And he doesn't use shaving foam.

So what can you get?

A wooden fur creme, but when he already owns a comb.

It's really a problem.

What can you get?

A wooden fur creme, but when he already owns a comb.

Come to the Bang Bang, we are back.

We're here with Harris Whittles and Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Present.

Holiday show.

And you know what?

When God closes the door, he opens a window.

One celebrity dies and another one comes in because we have the great.

He's from two huge sitcoms.

You know him from Cheers.

You know him from Frasier.

He played the same character in both.

Dr. Frasier Crane himself, Kelsey Grammar.

Hello everyone.

This is Dr. Frasier Crane himself, Kelsey Grammar.

How are you?

How are you everyone?

Mr. Grammar, what a pleasure to meet you.

I've long enjoyed your faux British stylings.

I've long enjoyed seeing t-shirts from your musicals.

Thank you.

Yeah, before we get to the ultimate expression of my art.

Before we get too far down the road, I want to introduce our next guest as well.

You know him from the TV show Happy Endings where he plays, what's the name of your character?

Max.

Adam Palley is here.

He's been on the show a couple of times this year.

The Amy Poehler episode, the Andy Samberg episode.

Probably the great, probably the great.

He played a couple of characters.

I can see.

All it hits.

You don't look too good.

I've long overscat.

It's a Saturday morning.

We're taping this.

Super early.

Pretty early.

Super early.

And your eyes are puffy.

Your face, just in general, is...

That's how it normally is, but yeah, I took out a few last night.

I'm...

Frasier.

You're a doctor.

Is there any kind of...

You can call me Kelsey Grammar.

Oh, sorry.

Yes, yes.

Can I go?

That would be like be calling Bill Cosby Dr. Huxterball or something like that.

I guess you're not a doctor either.

I'm not a doctor I have a...

And barely educated.

I'm gonna call you...

I'm gonna call you Boss.

You can call me Boss.

I'm a big Boss.

And I'm a big mean Boss.

You're the Boss.

And I have lots of fun.

Very, very...

It's a double meaning because the show itself is Boss.

It's totally Boss, man.

That's...

Well, yes.

That is the double meaning that Stars was going for.

Stars does, you know, plays on things like that and it's very, very fun.

That's why we call them the double meaning network.

Yes, the double meaning party down.

Because Stars...

Not having that much fun.

That's right.

Stars means two things.

Yes.

At least.

Yes.

At that Z at the end you're really talking now.

Yes.

It could mean anything.

Either Stars on the network.

Oh.

Yeah, let's get into it.

And...

Let's get into it.

Stars in the sky.

Let's get into it exactly what we're talking about.

As Andrew was saying that Z could...

Well, you know, it's a next factor.

It's not really a word.

It could mean anything.

It's a Z.

Yes.

Adam and Harris, do you guys know each other?

Yeah, we might have to go around.

Hey man, do you see...

Yeah, that's great.

I hear you.

Was that your Dick sniffling?

It wasn't my Dick sniffling.

Do you have any Sprite?

Tom's!

Lou's got...

You'll need something.

Do you have any cold Sprite?

I have room temperature Sprite.

Oh, that's gonna be good.

No room temperature Sprite.

This is the Christmas episode, isn't it Scott?

Yes, of course.

Well, I would just like...

What is your name?

My name is Kelsey Grammer.

Yes.

May we call you Frasier Boss?

Yeah, you know, call me Frasier Boss.

Call me, you know, call me Dr. Frasier Boss.

Dr. Frasier Boss.

Whatever you damn well please.

Dr. Frasier Boss, it is the...

Do you celebrate Christmas?

I celebrate the holiday that my new wife and I have invented.

It's called parumple pom pom-tom.

And it is slightly different than Christmas.

We do do presents.

Slightly.

But we are trying to...

We've realized that the real money is in religion.

And so we're starting our own religion.

And...

What's the religion called again?

The Church of Down Periscope.

Yes.

It's the Church of Down Periscope.

Oh, he's causing one?

That's actually the name?

Yes.

The Church of Down Periscope.

I thought you were razzling him.

Yes.

I thought I was razzling him.

Are you a member?

I don't think it's a nail on the head.

No, he's not a member.

He's not the only members are the cast of the movie America.

Not the cast of Down Periscope.

You think that that would be easy.

Well, I'm all about just rolling the dice and seeing what happens.

So I just figured why not do it for no reason another way.

You know, I've got 500 million dollars.

What else am I going to do?

Not to sort a wound, but you're on the outs with the cast of Down Periscope.

Yes.

You've talked about it before.

I'm not telling Teo's how to do it.

It's rubbing salt in the wound.

I don't think it is.

In fact, I don't even remember their names or who they are.

If I close my eyes, I can't tell which one of you is speaking.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

Okay.

What do you want for me?

I don't know.

You should be terribly open.

The one that's talking about being in Down Periscope is Kelsey Grammer.

Yes.

That's a good way to understand.

And I'm this one.

He's that one.

I'm this one.

He's that one.

I'm this one.

Dr. Fraser Boss.

Yes.

What?

Dr. Fraser Boss.

What are the trappings of parumpa-pum time?

Well, we all dance around the...

It's mainly a dancing thing.

We bring gifts and all of my children and I have seven or eight.

Two or three on the way.

That we will...

Twenty-way triplets?

Or you're just...

We have a white...

We have a white board, a dryaway or a race board.

We have either twins or triplets on the way.

We've stopped getting sonograms, but we feel like there's two things in there.

Just going by field.

Yes, yes.

You don't get those sonograms as text anymore?

No, no, no.

Don't text me any sonograms.

Sonogram alerts?

No.

Yes, we have a dry race white board that we dance around and everybody writes one way.

Everybody writes one wish on it and we give a simple presence under $50.

Oh, that's good.

That's really considered because not a lot of people have as much money as you do.

No, no, no, no.

So I don't want the children to grow up with a sense of fear of...

Adam, do you have to sigh that heavily right into the microphone?

Yeah, I do, Scott.

Today I do.

What did you do?

You're all stuck.

What?

Did you get up to anything crazy?

Well, I went to see Breaking Dawn with a bunch of effects on it.

The Twilight film?

Yeah.

Yeah, that's the one.

Part one of Part Four of the Twilight Saga?

I don't know, Scott.

What the fuck, man?

Come on, dude.

I don't know.

Yeah.

Part one of Part Four.

And I threw down a couple.

Yeah.

Just to get through it or after?

I'm not going to drink during.

Oh.

You want to stay razor sharp?

What kind of a person do you think he is?

Thank you.

Going to see this little girl movie, he's not going to drink?

Are you guys sweating pretty bad?

Are you guys sweating?

No, none of us.

It's perfectly comfortable.

To a man.

We are a nice room to help it.

I can't sweat.

Oh.

I sweat glands.

Take it out.

Oh.

I was sweating my toupee off all the time.

Oh, right.

That's a toupee.

Yeah, believe it or not.

I don't believe it.

It is.

It's an excellent toupee.

I have alopecia.

I have no real body hair.

So the eyebrows are fake too.

Eyebrows are fake.

Pubes are fake.

Why bother?

Those are fake.

Yes.

Harris knows.

Please pull your pants up.

Harris know.

Yep.

There you go.

Wow.

There you go.

Fake pubes.

Dr. Frazier Boss, I have to ask you.

Do you still keep in touch with Camille?

Unfortunately, I am forced to do.

I don't think you handled that well.

Yeah.

You don't?

No.

Let me hear your critique.

Yes.

I thought I handled this.

Scampered off to New York.

Left your kids over in LA.

Yes.

Seemed like you were really phoning it in when you hugged them.

And your performance in that show I thought you were phoning it in.

Did you see the show?

Yeah, yeah.

The casual fall.

No.

Like casual fall.

The casual fall.

Is the video of Dr. Frazier Boss hugging his children?

It's on, really.

How is my experience of Beverly Hill?

You know, I don't talk about real housewives.

I love Beverly Hill.

I don't like to give my children too much.

Right.

It looks like that.

It looks like you don't care for them that much.

Yes.

Well, they'll grow up simpering fools.

I'll have none of that.

I am Dr. Frazier Boss and I will have none of having my children be a little liberal idiots.

They will be strong, weird, Republican people who like to do weird sex.

Isn't it strange that you had a wife named Camille?

Yes, yes.

And Dr. Cosby Boss also had a wife named Camille.

Amazing point.

Yes, amazing point.

Yeah.

It's no coincidence.

I am attracted to women named Camille.

Powerful men who are funny and dramatic are often attracted to Camille.

Camille's.

What was the story as old as the name Camille?

Yeah.

What was Cosby's dramatic work?

Cosby's dramatic ghost dad.

I guess his ghost dad was pretty.

I think he said boo or something.

Scenes in Ice My.

Ice My.

Yes.

Leonard Part Six.

Leonard.

Yes.

Yeah.

His current comedy career.

Shimp.

Yeah.

Burn.

And was in.

Burn.

I'm teasing of course.

Who wouldn't want to watch him sit in a chow for three hours?

Or lie on the floor as I've heard.

But on a serious note, please do everyone pull up your pads and stop using so much foul language.

Yes.

You're the hip hop.

Come on.

You know.

Hoppity.

Stop it.

Stippity.

Stop it.

All coaching points.

Adam, are you are you are you wake up?

Come on.

Why did you even come here today?

If you because I made a promise that I do appreciate that.

Yeah.

You did promise to come by.

I said I would definitely be here.

Are you asking a guest to promise you?

What do you put them for the show?

I said yes.

I'll be here.

I promise.

I said okay.

That's a little weird.

But okay.

I said we had to weird thing.

We're sure I promise.

I said cross your heart.

And I did all that stuff and look I'm not going to go back on it.

I'm nothing if I'm not.

Yes.

If I'm not here.

I'm here.

You're nothing if you're not here.

Can I ask you a question?

We're just got weird.

Scott, do you have any new tracks coming out?

Do you have any new cool solids?

God, I wish I did.

I should have I should have made some for this holiday a couple years ago.

We had a holiday medley.

I mean weirdest cool up.

Yes.

I didn't make any of this this year.

So sorry.

Do you have ideas for me?

Do you want to pitch me something?

Well, I wanted to do pitch you something for my holiday.

Perumpa, pump, pump, time.

Yes.

You know, anything we can come to.

We can talk about it later.

We can formulate something.

Let's talk about it now.

Okay.

Let's talk about it now.

How about a song weirdest Scott so it'll be a parody of Little Drummer Boy, of course.

Okay.

I think it's a traditional song of Perumpa, pump, time.

Yes.

I love that song.

But we could do a thing where it's just a little bummer boy and he makes everybody sad because he's a little sad guy.

It almost sounds like that's no Cosby.

I swear to God.

It's something that Kelsey Grammer was doing about Cosby.

No.

You're not saying that.

Hold on.

You're face seems to be peeling around.

Yeah.

What is that?

No.

Oh man.

What just happened?

This took off his Dr. Fager boss mask.

Oh my God.

Oh Cosby, Bukowski.

Oh yeah.

Dr. Cosby Bukowski boss.

Yes.

Dr. Cosby Bukowski boss.

Bye.

Oh my God.

Wow.

This explains the Camille obsession.

Yes.

You're the same guy.

Camille is my wife in love very much.

You guys.

That was so great.

Could you believe that I put on that Kelsey Grammer second skin?

No, I can't believe it.

I'm not long believe it.

I'm staring at that second skin in a pile on the floor right now.

Yes.

It's disgusting.

It's even less high energy than it was before.

But now we've got some energy.

May I try it all?

Of course.

Oh yeah.

Kelsey Grammer skin.

Oh my God.

It affects the voice as well.

Oh my God.

There's a voice modulator inside the mask.

Hello everyone.

Whoa.

It's what a pleasure to be here.

Hello.

Oh hello Dr.

Dr.

God.

Hello Frasierly say.

Frasier boss.

Dr. Cosby Bukowski boss.

Yes.

Dr. Frasier Bukowski.

Bill Cosby Bukowski boss.

God damn it.

I'm having fun.

It's Saturday morning.

It's Christmas show.

It's nowhere near Christmas.

I'm having a blast.

Weird as Scott is here.

Do you have any kind of Christmas you know the art form in which you usually practice?

Yes.

Jillowums.

Jillowums do I have a Christmas Jillowum?

Well since I was pimped into doing this I don't.

But I'll make one up on the spot.

You can do some slam jillowetry.

Here's some slam jillowetry made up on the spot.

Okay.

Well Christmas is my favorite time of year.

It's the time for wine.

It's the time for beer.

The children gather round the rumble palm bush and they run all around and then they watch the movie push.

And then they watch the movie blow and then they watch the Lord of the Rings one with commercials.

Because that's what's new around Christmas time.

That's what you should do.

You watch movies with commercials like the Nickiress K.

It's Christmas movie.

And you watch it with commercials and the swears bleeped out.

That's what you do with fucking mouth.

Okay.

That made a lot of sense.

So good.

When you say the movie push do you mean the movie Precious based on an awful push by a size?

The movie, no.

There's a new movie coming out this Christmas and it's push based on the novel based on the movie Precious by Gaborne into the Bay.

I thought the movie was called PUSH.

PUSH?

No, no, no.

You're thinking of the ZZ Top song.

Thank you Dr. Frager Boss.

Well of course.

That's my pleasure.

PUSH?

The word PUSH feels like a pedophilia type of word.

Goddamn it Adam.

Do you have to dig copper right?

It's not like a boot.

Oh, oh.

Is this right man?

It's disgusting.

The dry heaves.

I'm good.

Is that your medical opinion?

As a, as a, as a faux doctor.

Yes.

I believe he's dry heaving.

I'm good.

Just drink a little more water or something.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Drink some tea.

That's maybe a little.

Oh yeah.

Have some of this room temperature sprite.

Oh.

Why don't you have some of this a poo poo pudding?

Poo poo poo pudding.

I'm good.

I'm just trying to make him dry heave guys.

Well Dr. Cosmo Vukowski boss.

Of course.

And Dr. Frager boss.

Yes.

When that?

I've never seen you two in the same room at the same time.

Well, it's never been possible before.

Yeah.

Now thanks to skin peel technology.

Here we go.

Yes.

It's very mission impossible.

Face off technology.

At one time.

Face forward slash off technology.

Remember when we were the kings of NBC?

At.

Do I ever?

Yes.

Those were the days old friend.

They were good times.

We had watched us admire us.

Yes.

Every household in America was riveted to our hilarious adventure.

Yes.

And now they can really see the seams.

They can really see we're really coming apart.

You guys in our previous guest Billy Crystal were both NBC juggernauts.

Yes.

Billy.

Yeah.

Eighty five.

He was on Saturday Night Live.

I hate when that happens.

That was one of his.

Oh.

Lariat's catchphrases.

Yes.

You look marvelous.

Yeah.

Thank you.

But you guys were all on TV at the same time pretty much right?

Were you on cheers yet Dr. Frazier boss?

In eighty five.

I don't.

I'm not quite sure.

You were.

Was I?

You were.

Cheers was nineteen eighty two.

And my own cheers now.

Have you done a new norm?

Norm.

One more.

Norm.

Even everybody.

Hey it's Norm.

Hey George went AKA Norm.

Look, Honic is always old friend.

Thank you.

He was cliff.

He just peeled his Cosby mask off.

And he's got a norm.

George went.

I'm putting the Cosby thing back on now.

Hello.

Oh wow.

I don't want to be.

Norm.

Yes.

Boring.

So you're all.

You're boring.

No, just kidding.

You're awesome.

I love you.

You're all childhood.

Anyway.

You're afraid.

I'm not afraid of anything.

It's the one.

I really love it.

You're afraid of George went in.

It's not a fear of things.

Yeah, you know you're afraid.

Good thing you covered your bases.

You were scared.

Yeah.

Everything's cool with everyone on TV.

I've grown weary of being Dr. Frazier Fox.

Why don't you take off your doctor?

You're a fucking boss.

I'm going to be a little scared.

You're a fucking boss.

But you're a little...

Ugh!

Like being in a prison.

Oh yeah.

Because not only do you have to talk like him and look like him, you have to think like him.

Yes.

Doc.

Doc and Scary in there.

Adam, do you have any kind of Christmas plans?

Are you doing anything?

Oh, Hanukkah.

Oh, that's right.

You're a American.

Hanukkah for Christmas.

One of America's finest Jews.

I am one of America's finest Jews.

Thank you for saying that.

AFJ.

I am it.

AFJ.

Has it been a tough road to hoe?

Being a Jew?

In Hollywood.

Yeah.

You never know if you have...

It's hard to get an internship too.

It's hard to get an internship.

Bill Cosby.

Yeah.

You used to be on TV and now Adam here is a TV star.

Oh.

On Wednesday nights, not on Thursdays, which used to be both of your domains.

ABC, not NBC.

Mm-hmm.

But do you have any advice for a young star making his way up in the world?

I could really...

I'll tell you something.

Whatever these Jews tell you.

Okay.

That's me.

Whatever they tell you, you do it.

Okay?

You just do it.

I knew that.

On the pilot.

You do it.

If they tell you to button the button, your button is a stupid button.

If they tell you to comb your hair through the right and stay to the left, you do that.

And then when they pick up your show, do whatever the fuck you want.

You're gonna go fucking crazy.

Is that kind of what you did?

Oh my.

The Cosby Show pilot was pretty straight.

And button the buttons?

And comb my hair.

And then I went...

I don't know.

I call it that pilot.

Your hair was combed and your buttons were a button.

Yes, yes.

I'm thinking, well this is strange.

That's not the doctor.

You'll call me Bukowski that I do.

I remember the boss.

This is a Jews work.

This is the work of Jews.

And then I was like, I want to make my set, you know, very adult contemporary African.

And I went fucking insane.

That was all improvised.

All those kids wore decor was all improvised.

Yep.

In the pilot.

The set of your home was like a kaboots.

It was like a kaboots.

It was like in a...

And it had...

Yeah, it was very Jewish.

And then I could do whatever I want.

So went crazy.

And you unbuttoned those buttons.

Unbuttoned those buttons.

You seized combing your hair.

You did.

The anti-pussycat dalled it.

I did.

And I gave the children a cup of...

I guess you actually did push a gun.

Yeah, exactly.

You buttoned up the button.

Right.

No, wait.

No, it's the anti.

Where are we?

I'm lost.

Do you smell burnt toast?

Oh, are you guys smelling that too?

Oh, yeah.

You guys are smelling that burnt toast too?

I just got a regular toast.

Oh, yeah.

No, that's right because I made some toast.

It's making me hungry.

You have a regular stroke.

If it's a smell regular toast to have a regular stroke.

Having a stroke on the rest.

This is a song about having some strokes.

Sorry.

Go ahead.

Do you guys want to...

A little something that we call the freestyle wrap contest.

Okay.

Oh, look at this.

It's exciting.

All right.

Five ways freestyle wrap contest.

We have some champions here.

I think we've all...

Everyone in this room has been a part of one of these.

I have never done this.

I've never done this.

Andrew Lloyd-Weber has just my first time.

Yeah, that's right.

I'm a virgin like seeing the Rocky Auto picture.

True.

That's right.

Yeah.

I would say the holidays is probably what we should rap about.

I just been...

I thought it was freestyle.

Yeah, but I mean we need a...

...some sort of subject.

...a jumping off point.

All right.

Drew Carey.

Whatever you want.

Doctor Cosby Vikowski boss.

I'm gonna ask you to start us out.

Okay.

Ugh.

Christmas time.

Doodle doodle.

One, two, three.

I like Christmas.

I gotta take a big fat piss man.

Hey.

Everybody listen.

I like to go pissing in the streets.

That's what I do.

I pull out my dick.

I'm a doodle doodle.

I like girls.

I like friends.

We have fun till the end of your life.

All you gotta do is hang out.

If you don't want to get a job, that's cool.

You still rule.

You don't have to do anything.

Let's kill yourself.

Or be homeless.

Or whatever.

Just go.

Let it all hang out.

Just like the rock horror picture when you're a virgin.

That was funny.

Made me laugh.

Android Webber doesn't make crap anymore.

It's just great superstar.

What's the worst?

All you musical assistants are worst of all.

Yo.

What's up bro?

I like happy endings.

Yo.

Harris Widdles.

Humble back up in this house.

Humble brags is my favorite to a defeat.

Don't even fuss with me.

Who are you passing it on?

I'm passing off to add a pally yo.

Oh.

Fuck.

Oh.

Okay.

Cyber dog.

Give a hug.

Tug the rug.

It's nug.

Fuck.

Cyber dog.

Hug.

You're supposed to do it twice.

Nice.

Mice.

Rice.

Don't hate.

With the mate.

Number eight.

All right.

Who are you passing off to?

Oh.

I'm passing off to add a pally.

All right.

Who are you passing off to?

Oh.

It's a arid little.

Airdog.

All right.

I can only rap British like the streets.

We established that last time.

It's Christmas.

Chestnuts.

Omen's.

Cashews.

It's a hill nuts.

This is nuts.

I'm going knuckin' fucks.

Excuse me.

Ossifur.

We gotta get the threat back.

Come on.

Here we go.

Come on, Ayers.

Well, it's time to get jolly like a fucking wrencha.

A wrencha on a kabootz.

Where you have your own goats and self-sustaining your milkum.

You eat them.

You go to school if you're a little kid.

Shkalim is plural for shackles.

That's the Jewish currency.

I'm out.

Well, Mr. Webber.

Mr. Webber.

No, no, no.

Mr. to me.

Here we go.

Well, my name's Lord Webberhead.

I'm here to say it.

What's your stuff?

It's not holiday, wait.

I say holiday.

You say vacation.

It's all part of your Americanization.

Santa Claus.

I say he's Father Christmas coming down the chimps there with bacon.

The awful don't ya?

That's how we go.

Him and me.

It's time for Christmas presents and crackles.

Don't get tired or I'll be naked.

Don't worry.

Santa Claus is coming.

He's going to give you presents.

You're in the running for being on the night list.

You're not naughty.

Everything is going potty.

It's crazy up in here.

And Christmas time.

That's how I rhyme.

Christmas time.

It's got oncoming.

It's so rappy.

Where's this guy?

Go where this guy?

Uh-huh.

Go where this guy.

Uh-huh.

Here we go.

Well, it's Christmas time.

Man, I'm here to say it's fun to rap in a Christmas way.

Things coming down the chimney.

Oh, did you?

I was in the room at that point.

Well, the famous Christmas.

Did I bite your rhymes?

You fit his style.

Alright.

You're gonna go.

Santa comes down the chimney.

And he comes just for me.

His name's not Jim-a-neet.

Cricket!

No, he's here to stick it to my moms.

And give me lots of presents like bombs.

And then when I open them up, they're not bombs.

I wouldn't go to school and bomb the school.

No, that ain't cool.

It's Christmas.

I got two weeks off.

What am I gonna do?

I'm gonna take my clothes off.

Yeah, Christmas.

Here we go.

Christmas.

Here we go.

I'm in the shower.

Cause that's the only place where it's cool to be.

A new deist.
