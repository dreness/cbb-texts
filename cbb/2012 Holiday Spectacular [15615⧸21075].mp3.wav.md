Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang!

Thank you so much Steve Hennel for that cast-rate submission and silver bells just kidding.

We are here for our fantastic Comedy Bang Bang Holiday Spectacular.

Welcome to the show.

This is your first time listening.

It's a great one because we're doing an extra long show where a cavalcade of stars will be dropping by.

The entire program we have some wonderful people who are going to be dropping by.

But let's start with someone first.

By the way, my name is Scott Ockermann.

If you've never heard the show, I'm your host.

I host it every week.

I have guests coming through the show and Big Christmas Show, our final one of the year, our final regular episode of the year.

We still will have two best-ups coming to you this next Monday and the Monday after that.

And I'm Harris.

Oh god.

Why?

What?

Was that not a good place?

Wait until I introduce you.

Oh, okay.

I don't know Linda.

All right.

Well, as fans of the show.

And I'm Harris.

As fans of the show, really, that's when you choose to drop in.

I don't do this.

That often.

What do you mean you don't do this out of it?

I know it's been a while.

I'm rusty.

Yeah, that's true.

One of our future guests pointed at himself when you said I'm rusty.

Let me...

The Tin Man.

Oh, yeah.

Let me explain who you are.

Okay, if you've never heard the show before, quite often...

Tin Man is a Republican, huh?

Oh, he's asking for oil.

Continue.

I'm Harris.

If you've never heard the show before, this next person is quite often a co-host.

He hasn't been on in a while.

He's returned to Parks and Recreation, a show for which he is a writer.

And he's been very busy.

His schedule has been packed because they decide to fit a few extra laughs in per episode.

This season?

No extra money, mind you.

But it's been paying off because it's been a great season and he is here.

It's a Saturday morning when we're taping this and he got here and he made the time and it's a pleasure to have him on the show.

He's a stand-up comedian in his own right and mainly a writer though now.

Yeah, I don't even think I am a stand-up.

You used to be a stand-up comedian.

Do you remember you called me out in that article you did years ago?

Some people get writing jobs and just stop doing stand-up altogether.

Looking at you, Harris Whittles.

Because I knew you would get a Google alert.

That's specific.

But self-fulfilling prophecy.

By the way, Harris Whittles is here.

Hi.

And I'm Harris.

It is tough to do stand-up while you're working on something.

I should have been looking at myself because I had stopped as well.

Yeah, yeah.

Why is that?

You just kind of get burned out.

You work all day telling jokes.

Someone told me they were a musician.

They never had a more fertile writing period than when their job was terrible.

When they were rolling up posters for a living.

He said that he wrote so many songs because his daytime creative life was so inactive that when he would get off of work, of course, he would then write a ton of songs.

Instead of becoming?

Is that what you said?

That's what I'm trying to say.

So I think it's very tough when you're in a creative job all day to then, you know.

I should work at a poster rolling history.

Yes.

That's what I'm saying.

All right.

Do you know anyone?

Well, my friend, he left a job to become a professional musician.

Oh, that's perfect.

There's an opening.

Yeah.

It may have been 20 years ago.

Well, poster industry is still going strong.

I have too.

Most of my posters are online now though.

You just put them up.

You just have a giant iPad that I put on my wall.

I have like several iPads on my wall.

What are they going to make that iPad maxi?

That's what I want to know.

I know.

And that's not a maxi pad joke.

I don't know what it is if it's not that.

For posters, you know, for posters and like fake window scenes.

iPad maxi Steve Jobs get on it.

Yikes.

Who's the new guy?

It's like a guy's name Tony.

Apple Tony.

Apple D.F.

What if when Steve Jobs left Apple, the only person that could fill his shoes is Apple D.F.

Apple P.

Yeah, or Apple Paltrow.

That's another Apple.

Oh, there you go.

Martin, is it?

Yeah, it might be Apple Martin.

Apple Paltrow Martin.

Apple Paltrow sounds better, doesn't it?

Yeah, I love that name.

It's beautiful.

Yeah.

Boom.

Apple Martin.

That's like if Apple did a merger with Lockheed Martin.

Yeah.

That's like someone being named Banana Martin.

It just doesn't make sense.

You're right.

When you put it that way, Harris?

Yeah, I agree.

I'll break it down free, but that's what I'm here for.

So I can't help but notice that you're wearing a never not funny hat.

I am.

My favorite podcast, Never Not Funny.

You guys should check it out.

Listen to it, subscribe to it.

Jimmy Partis podcast.

I was a guest on it recently.

It's like Letterman wearing a Leno hat.

What?

It is.

One way.

We're not the competition.

We're friends.

And then also, you're doing this podcast and you got a show.

What?

It's a TV show.

Well, I mean, Letterman doing a podcast.

Well, I mean, I don't have a TV show anymore.

We don't know if we're coming back.

And it may as well use the time wisely with a podcast.

I just didn't know how to tell you that I think you're like Letterman to me.

Oh, thank you.

That's what you're trying to say.

You're not criticizing.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, that's so nice.

Yeah, you're like Jimmy Kimmel to me.

I'll take it.

He doesn't ruffle feathers.

He's still very funny.

Mm-hmm.

I love it.

Okay.

Congrats.

Well, then we're friends.

Yeah.

So Harris...

And if that was a fat joke, he's skinny now.

He is.

I was not a fat joke at all because I don't consider you to be a fat man.

I consider me to be a fat man.

Speaking of the fat man, it is our Christmas episode and that old fat man is going to come through the chimney at some point, I'm sure.

Harris, before we got to our Christmas celebratory stuff, what I would love to ask you is, first I want to ask you about your book because you have a book that just came out.

Oh, yeah.

That'd be great.

That we want people to put into people's stockings, ostensibly.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

Stockings.

Even at Christmas.

Stock your stuffings.

Stock your stuffings with this book.

So if you have or baking a turkey, if you're roasting a turkey...

Then stock your stuffings.

Stock your stuff.

It tear up pages of this book and put it into your stuffings.

Yeah.

It's the humble brag book.

Just buy it.

You...

Everyone's heard of humble brag.

Everyone misuses it.

Yeah.

And you, as the person who created it or the one person who knows what it is, I think I have a good handle on it because I'm constantly correcting people.

But you created this Twitter humble brag where you don't create content necessarily, but you retweet other people's tweets that are humble brags.

And if this is people's first experience listening to this show and they don't know who you are, they don't know what humble brag is, maybe they don't know what Twitter is, I don't know.

Explain Twitter first.

Okay.

And then what humble brags?

Twitters are...

It's a really cool new social media site where you basically have 140 characters or letters or...

Sounds like this show.

100 and 40 characters.

Oh, God.

Let's hope that's not true.

Because I'm here for the whole thing.

And then...

So basically you get to say whatever you want.

A lot of people, you know, talk about what they're doing.

Really?

They allow you to say whatever you can literally say whatever you want and they won't take it down as far as I know.

Well, they prosecute you.

Unless it's like you're fraudulent, you're pretending to be someone else, they'll take it down.

So libel, they'll take it down.

What about threats of assassination of public figures?

I think that's fair game.

That's what I used it for.

Okay.

So you use this microblogging site in your personal life.

I would call it microblogging.

I'd call it like the social media site.

Okay.

And then...

So...

So you can post whatever you want, hit send, it goes out to anyone that follows you.

That's an important part of the process, by the way, hit send.

A lot of people, they just write these things and they forget that.

Exactly.

Yeah.

So...

The tweets build up.

Yeah.

You got a tweet backlog.

And then...

What's next?

Oh, people read it.

And then enjoy it or object to it or are unfazed by it.

And then...

Then this little...

And then somewhere down the line, people took that medium as...

Hey, I'm going to start bragging.

Mm-hmm.

Right?

About what I'm doing during the day.

About why I'm great.

Sure.

And then at a further point down, people decided bragging, that's kind of unattractive to people.

I'm going to start bragging in a self-deprecating way.

Which makes me seem like I'm not bragging.

Exactly.

Because I'm being self-deprecating.

Right.

However, what I'm really doing is letting everyone know that I...

Right.

I'm doing great things that I'm doing.

And you know what we call that, Scott?

Mm.

No clue.

Oh, bullberry.

What?

So, then...

What's an example of one of the most typical...

The most typical one is like a model or something that says like, I hate model and swimsuits.

I miss cake.

You know?

Or something like that.

Right.

So she's...

That's a double brag in a way.

Yeah.

Because she's saying, hey, I look great in swimsuits.

Right.

I have the willpower not to eat cake unlike most of the world.

And I have access to cake.

Yeah.

We have to be fun about that.

That's a triple brag.

There are people out there...

I'm not working this half cake.

Yes.

There are people out there who work three jobs.

They're working Walmart under 30 hours as to not enrage Obamacare.

And...

And then they have to have another 30 hour a week job and then another 29 hour a week job.

They can't afford cake.

Okay.

They're too busy putting bread on the table.

They can't have cake because they're putting other bread.

Other bread.

Yeah.

Other flour products.

Yeah.

Exactly.

Yeah.

So anyway, so you have a book out now.

Yeah.

I bought...

And...

Let's just buy it.

Wait.

What is it though?

Like...

And by the way, I have not seen this book.

You have not sent me one.

Oh, I'll send you one.

Oh, really?

I absolutely will.

I just...

So...

I compiled retweets from people.

Someone...

Are these copyright protected?

No, I don't think so.

Okay.

But you truly don't...

You could be in for a lawsuit.

I took out an insurance policy so that people, if they sue me, I don't...

It's the company that pays.

I did do that.

Wow.

You did do that.

Yeah, but I think there will be lawsuits.

I have no...

We didn't ask Twitter for permission.

I shouldn't even be saying this right now.

Probably.

So the actual display of Twitter is copyrighted and yet you're using it.

Yes.

The people's tweets are copyrighted probably.

They're their own property.

Now what I say to that is it's in the Library of Congress.

Now is that true?

I don't know.

Right.

Is your book in the Library of Congress?

No, I think that tweets are in the Library of Congress.

I don't know what the Library of Congress really is.

At some point I heard someone say that and it sounded like I could apply it to this.

I think the Library of Congress has an iPad maxi that just all the tweets are kept on it.

It's like a maxi pad joke?

No, I already said that it wasn't like that.

So there's a book you talk about these people tweets.

What I love is you break them down.

I haven't read the book but I'm guessing.

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, there's some analysis.

Great.

And it gets snarky.

Sure.

So people are...

I don't know if our society people are into snarky anymore.

Yeah.

So we have a great report, Manto of snarky and analysis.

When did you learn what a portmanteau is?

From a special thing, there's a guy on it named Natalie Portmanteau.

So you looked it up.

And I looked it up.

Great.

So Harris, by that book, we want everyone to buy the book.

So what people are really wanting more than all of that is they want to know, you haven't been on the show in so long, there's a feature that you do on the show and they want to know do you have more of that feature.

I got some foam.

Alright, let's hear it.

Let's hear that theme song.

It's Harris's foam corner.

Harris's foam corner.

Yeah.

Come on.

Harris's foam corner.

What?

Yo.

Come on.

Harris's foam on the phone.

Get the phone.

It's a foam corner.

Alright, thank you Reggie Watts for that theme song for Harris's foam corner.

And what this feature is, is it started out as something called phone corner because you, Harris Whittles, owner and purveyor of Harris's foam corner, you would write jokes on your phone, which was we don't have scratch paper necessarily lying around anymore, but we have these devices.

What's flash paper?

That's the stuff that goes into flames.

Yeah.

That's cool.

And flash cards are, yeah, two of our upcoming guests both made the exact same magicianly mime.

They threw flash paper into the air and made it vanish.

At the exact same time.

So you started something, you started something called the phone corner.

It's Paul.

You started something called the phone corner, which is you would read terrible jokes that you wrote on your phone that were not good enough to be tweets.

Well, not good enough to be stand up because it started as a stand up thing.

That's true.

And now it's kind of more, and then it became, yeah, just a Twitter.

And now it's basically just to come on here.

Right.

Foam is purely just to come on here and get lambasted.

It transmogrified into the foam corner.

It's certain.

What?

It changed into a foam corner at a certain point because either we misheard you at one point or I'm not sure exactly what, but people thought it would be fun to have a foam corner.

Yes.

I think that I think M and M were really close in the alphabet.

It sounds like you're saying the same thing when you say M and M. Those two letters sound alike.

Wait, when you say M and M?

M and M.

M and M?

Yeah.

Okay.

So you can follow each other.

L M M O P. Oh, okay.

Got you.

So I can see where it's confusing.

All right.

I got you.

So now, so now we're going to hear some foam.

Yeah.

All right.

So phone.

Do you need any kind of setups?

You need the theme song again to launch right now?

We already got the theme song.

I'll just go into it.

All right.

Here we go.

So you know how people sometimes when they over pronounce something like they'll go wheat thin, right?

I guess.

But you know, like some or they'll be like, I don't know.

I don't even have another.

I'll just stick with the peak.

The peak.

Or, okay.

A while.

That's another one.

Okay.

Sure.

That's a thing that proper folk do.

I've heard it.

Okay.

But it should be.

Well, heat thin.

Well, heat thin over a Ohio.

Like why does the H come before the W just because you're pronouncing it like that doesn't make any sense.

So what?

I'm saying if you're going to say, wheat thin, then say, well, heat thin.

So we.

That's it.

Okay.

All right.

Next one.

All right.

What's the next one?

The next one is about.

Um, what?

You know Amazon the website.

Sure.

Yeah.

That's opposed to Amazon the, uh, uh, jungle.

Yeah.

What is Amazon the website look like in person?

What is that's got to be one big room, huh?

What?

Like they have everything.

They sell everything.

Where is that?

Oh, okay.

It's insanity.

Meaning where's the brick and mortar?

Yeah.

Where is Amazon?

I'd love to see it.

Yeah.

It's a.

All right.

So when people say, uh, when people say I've read studies or there's, there's been studies.

Let's be honest.

There's probably been one study, right?

Or they've read one study.

Like I don't, I don't think a lot of people read multiple studies on things.

I don't, I don't know that these are qualifying even as jokes anymore.

You, I mean, these are musings at best.

Yeah, at best.

All right.

Oh, okay.

Let's get, let's have a strong middle or end.

All right.

You know how, if you go into a guy's public, okay, in life, someone far, so this is in life, in life out in regular life of someone far, it's funny.

Like you laugh at it.

Okay.

If you go into a guy's bathroom, a public bathroom, everyone is just like farting and being very serious.

Why, why is it not funny in there?

It's everyone's just like business is usual, but it's not.

It's hilarious still.

Well outside the confines of the bathroom, it is improper, which is why it's amusing.

I hate that people think it's okay to go into public bathrooms and be horses.

It's fucking disgusting.

Okay.

Finish strong.

What do you got?

I can't.

I truly can't.

I'll finish strong.

Hey, Brussels sprouts in broccolini.

Enjoy your 15 minutes.

Oh.

Hey, this is phone corner.

Oh, come on.

Hey, this is phone corner.

What?

Yo, come on.

Hey, this is phone corner.

All right.

Tell you what, Harris, let's take a tiny little break when we come back.

We'll have more guests, more fun.

This is comedy bang bang holiday special.

We'll be right back after this.

We're back here with Harris Whittles of Humblebrag fame and of foam corner misfortune and fame and in fame.

In for me.

And we have a very special guest here on the show who just came by and she's a fantastic musician.

I've been a fan of her work ever since the days that she was in the sugar cubes.

Oh, love the sugar cubes.

Yes.

Great band.

She went solo and rose to the stratosphere via her solo career and she's here to provide some holiday cheer and Bjork is with us.

Hello Bjork.

It's good to be here today.

I do not find cheer in the holidays though.

Let me put that.

Oh.

Let me make that clear.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I guess when I saw you, you know, you asked if you could come during the holiday show and you brought your guitar.

Yes, it is very.

It is a very sad time for Iceland during the holidays as you call them.

Why is it so surprising?

The days of nightmares as we call them.

Oh.

Meaning all of December or?

Yes.

In America, you all wish to have a white Christmas and you don't realize the consequences of your wishes of your dreams.

Hmmm.

Consequences.

What do you mean?

Yes, what do you think it comes from?

Snow, I think it's from the clouds I guess.

I don't know.

Cold precipitation.

Yes, and I guess planes come from the clouds as well.

They took off from somewhere.

Oh, so you're saying snow comes from?

It comes from Iceland.

Oh.

Every December, all the ice and snow of my country.

Disappears?

Disappears and goes to America to fulfill our wishes.

I thought Iceland was the dream.

That's Greenland.

It's all in the title, Iceland.

So wait, so you're saying?

It should be called selfish land.

So we understand.

You're saying that all of Americans hope and pray for a white Christmas that even say that song white Christmas and that works.

Yes, you know the demon warlock.

Bing Crosby.

He was a demon warlock.

No.

That does how we know him.

No.

Oh my goodness.

So all these wishes actually are successful wishes.

Yes, all of our snow and ice.

It migrates every December.

Oh my goodness.

Well, what do you do without snow?

All the snow fairies and elves and dwarves, the ice dwarves, the ice trunels.

They're likely well on the beach.

They shriveled up and they die slowly for a month.

Oh my gosh.

Most of them die off.

Some survive to January when the snow returns.

When you're bored with your snow in America and forget about it.

Oh my gosh.

That is a terrible story.

Yes.

So this is that's the bad thing that happens is the snow dwarves.

Yes, all of our snow disciplines.

No, but what that's fine for the humans.

Also, we do not have refrigerators.

Iceland's all of those bad.

Okay.

That's my show for a month.

Right.

Fairies dying.

We throw the food away.

So when baby's poop, we don't throw it away.

We just put it outside our door in the snow.

It's no big deal.

Okay.

Until December.

Oh, and there's shit.

I'm just baby shit on my front.

Just baby shit though, not regular human shit.

But baby shit is worse.

No, we've got that down the roof.

Oh, okay.

You shit in toilets?

Or just right on the roof?

In what?

Oh, okay.

She doesn't even know what it is.

Oh my gosh.

All right.

Got that.

Let who do what?

Well, he said you.

I think you know who you are.

Let you shit in a toilet.

Toilet who?

All right.

Bjork.

So what?

This is the worst time of year for you then.

It's a horrible time.

Which is why you must have escaped and come to America.

It'd be like if there was a holiday where all your cheeseburgers disappeared for a month.

Oh.

What would you do?

Gosh.

America might get a little more healthy.

Yeah, I said it.

I just switched to chicken tenders.

So you brought your guitar though.

So what are you?

What exactly are you doing with it?

In the baby Jesus, it is still his time of year.

Okay.

So you do believe in Christmas as a holiday.

Yes.

And baby Jesus' birth is being something to be celebrated.

Yes.

So I was hoping to play my rendition of Silent Night, which is a mashup of my life.

But my song, it's oh so quiet.

Yes.

I do know it.

Yeah, that's a good video too.

Yeah.

Well, this isn't going to be the video.

Okay.

It's a podcast.

He was just saying that he enjoyed the video.

Not every compliment is.

I enjoy someone who's not you.

No.

We really got off on the wrong foot here.

What?

Paris.

Fuck you.

It's almost like he's heard the program before.

Yeah, I know.

Or people just really hate me right off of that.

All right.

So you want to sing Silent Night, Bjork?

Yes.

And I won't be representing it in any video.

Fish, what?

I know.

I wasn't saying that.

It's impossible.

No av equipment here at all.

We know.

No umbrellas.

Unplugged acoustic performance.

So this is quite a treat.

Bjork was Silent Night here on Comedy Bang Bang.

Let's hear it.

Silent Night, Shh.

Holy Night, Shh.

Oh, no.
