♪♪♪ By the power of Merlin Street, I podcast you out, Matt Demon.

Interesting.

That was a catch phrase by soda pop cat.

Soda pop cat.

Now that's interesting.

Now I want to know more about the soda pop cat.

That's the show.

Is it a cat who likes soda pop or is it a cat made out of soda pop?

Oh man.

That would be so delicious.

Or is this like a koo guy who likes soda pop?

Ooh, ooh, ooh.

Maybe jazz, jazz, jazz.

By the way, we've...

Ooh.

We've been talking a lot about Figurindan and the modal nodes.

Yes, we're sure.

Are we thinking quite a bit of his work over these past few years.

By the way, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

We've been singing a lot.

Someone alerted to me, is this true that the style of music and the original Star Wars that Figurindan and the modal nodes plays is jazz?

What are you saying to me?

I think that in the Star Wars like press materials and all of that...

No.

They called it jazz.

There's no fucking way.

I'm going to look it up.

Cantina band jizz.

I refuse to believe.

I'm going to look it up.

Cantina band jizz.

Oh, I did not expect that.

Oh, I'm glad that we're sitting on opposite sides of the table so I cannot see what you're seeing.

Listen to this.

Giz was an upbeat swinging genre of music, most notably performed by Figurindan and the modal nodes.

Oh, most notably performed by them?

And the mech's Rebo band.

Subgenres of Giz included the styles of Giz wall, a...

A bade and glitz.

So Jats was slightly similar to Jiz.

How does Jats sound somehow filthier than Jiz?

Jats.

I'm going to Jats, babe.

I'm going to Jats.

Stop it.

I'm going to fucking Jats.

That's from Wikipedia.

Yeah, well, they can go fuck themselves.

How is it spelled?

J-I-Z-Z.

Come on.

Come on, guys.

I think the slang term Jiz was not popularized back in 1977, perhaps.

And so they call it...

Sure.

They're like...

Yeah, I know.

Lucas being like, I think it's funny that they played Jiz.

I would...

I can't.

I don't think...

I don't like this.

I think Lucas is a nerd who had never heard that term before and is like...

It's funny because it's like jazz.

But do you think somebody played a trick on him?

Like somebody called it Jiz and he was like, oh, that sounds good.

I think it was someone playing...

Why is this accepted in pressure of him?

Oh, they're under his Lucas.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I found out.

I was mortified.

Yeah.

I mean, it's all a brief history of Star Wars and Jiz from Buzzfeed is something that just came up.

It's crazy.

Hey, Buzzfeed, take an hour off.

One hour.

You didn't need to make this list.

One hour out of the day.

You didn't need to make this list.

Oh, my gosh.

Anyway, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

We are here for another week and we're counting down your top episodes of 2015.

Your top Comedy Bang Bang episodes of 2015 and on the show today we're going to do six, five and four.

We're going to do six, five and four.

And these are good EPs, I got to say.

I have to say, these are good ones.

They are...

What was Harris's joke?

Omar.

It's like Omar and Mike taking out the trash.

They're good EPs.

That's right.

We may hear from him a little later.

And I have, of course, Paul of Tomkins.

Hi.

Have I introduced you yet?

I'm Scott Ocherman.

I am a stand-up comedian.

You're a thingman of my imagination as well.

That's right.

I encourage Scott to be a good boy.

Yes.

It's interesting.

I have never listened to this podcast back.

I imagine it's just me talking and then short bursts of silence before I try to interrupt the person again.

Little background of me.

I am a bug wearing a top hat.

And you're a singing bug as well.

And always let your conscience be your god.

Oh.

I'm no fool.

No, sorry.

I'm gonna live to be 103.

I ate the cart of all my enemies.

I have the power and their intelligence.

What's that?

That's me imagining you.

Um, yes.

Paul of Tomkins.

I got no strings to hold me down.

If people are listening to this for the first time, they just got their new iPods on Christmas.

Explain who you are.

My name is Paul.

Yes.

I'm a comedy person.

Yes, queen.

I do stand up comedy.

I do TV hosting of comedy show.

I do.

TV hosting of comedy show.

This is getting great Hollywood ad book.

I do TV hosting of comedy show.

It's good now.

It's good now t-shirt.

I have my own podcast here on the Earwolf Network called Spontaneous Nation where I do more comedy things.

And I do on comedy bang bang from time to time.

I do comedy character.

Both with K's comedy character.

A cavalcade of comedy characters.

Triple K.

Hurray!

Finally.

We're in that bell.

Jump for joy.

White Man's Day is here.

Jesus.

No.

It's not that kind of a show.

Not that kind of a show.

While we were working on Mr. Show, this, I want to say this was the third season.

This is before I got there.

When I was on the outside looking in.

We had seen some document.

Like in trading places looking at those old guys.

That's right.

And remember I was eating a salmon through my Santa Claus beard?

Yeah, of course.

That image of Danak great eating that salmon that raw fish through his beard and like the strands of beard are getting in it.

Is that it just hunts me to his teeth?

It makes my teeth hurt.

Oh, everything about it.

It's so bleak.

Yeah.

Putting cotton through your teeth.

Look.

If you're going to be dentist.

Cotton if you're lucky.

Yeah.

If you're lucky, that's another T-shirt.

No.

More applies to the T-shirt I think.

Yeah, that's true.

Well, it's pointing at itself.

But the earwolf T-shirts are well made.

Are they not?

They are.

They're very well made.

Yes.

They're soft.

Yes.

Cotton if you're lucky.

We're talking about...

What the fuck?

I don't know.

What the fuck?

We're talking about the Santa...

Yeah.

Mr. Show.

Yes.

Ring that bell.

There was some documentary about why supremacists and they at some point they sing this song.

The begins ring that bell jump for joy.

White man's day is here.

There's no way I could even begin to tell you the rest of the lyrics.

Some of the most hateful...

Maybe the most hateful stuff I've ever heard about.

Meaning you've committed them to memory but it's just not going to say them?

Absolutely.

In my...

Burned into my brain forever.

Forever.

And the worst part is sometimes that will get stuck...

But it's a...

In my brain a little...

A hunkingly beautiful tune.

When you can separate the lyrics.

No, it's beautiful.

It's very joyful.

A hunkingly beautiful tune.

I've got a max.

I'm not sure if I'm remembering him.

Max.

The keyboard.

Oh, that dude.

Yeah.

He looks like a toy.

Oh man.

He looks so huggable.

Do I say huggable?

Plushable.

Toy.

The toy.

Hi, I'm Max Rebo.

Won't you like to hug me for a good night's sleep?

When do you want to take me home?

I'm Max Rebo.

Would it be nice to have me in your bedroom late at night?

I play around next to that long penis-lipped singer.

Yeah, it's like Noodle.

It's like...

Is that what her name is?

That's right.

She's got a big penis and then lips on the end of it.

It's like a real live skin flute.

It's like what if a vagina was on the end of a penis?

That's what her whole thing is.

That's the miracle of life.

Yep.

Here in the Star Wars universe.

Hey, welcome.

Do they call it the Star Wars universe, you think?

No.

Do you saw the Force Awakens?

There's a point where Han Solo says, I haven't seen anything like this inside of the Star Wars universe.

The all aground go, man, these Star Wars.

Can I confess to you a weird reaction that I'm sticking out your tongue and put the communion way for a bonnet?

The communion way for the Holy Eucharist.

The Eucharist compels me.

Does that sound like this, right?

No, that is something.

It's a T-shirt.

The Eucharist compels me.

That's a T-shirt.

When I was watching Star Wars, the Force Awakens, the character of Rey, Episode 7, played by Daisy Fuentes.

Yeah.

Daisy Ridley.

Yep.

I guess this speaks to where I am in my life.

That I felt very paternal towards that character.

Oh, you're like, watch out, Han.

Well, it was not so much that I was worried for her.

I was proud of her.

Oh, yes.

Isn't that weird?

Yeah, I understand.

Like, she's a beautiful young woman, but I wasn't having- You weren't like, oh man, I'd love to be John Bougueux.

Yeah, I wasn't having a crush on her.

Yeah, yeah.

It was more like, I'm proud of you.

Yeah.

But I was like, I would like to walk her down the aisle.

And I hope you do.

With that beard.

If you're out there by the way.

I don't know, if Tatiana Maslani is a fan, maybe she is.

If you get Tatiana, if you get married, I would be honored to walk you down the aisle.

Yeah, but first, Daisy Ridley.

But that's where- well, look, they're all my daughters.

That's how I feel about them.

They're all my sons.

All these young- No, no sons.

I don't feel paternal.

You know that reference, though, you all my sons from the play, all my sons.

Never seen it in the last line.

Never seen it and I'm not familiar with it.

They were all my sons.

Is that truly the last line?

I think it was.

Yeah, I believe it is.

It's right before he's led off to jail.

Spoiler alert!

That's a big spoiler.

Yeah.

Also, I don't know who is led off to jail for war crimes.

Is there dad?

Yeah.

All the sons' dad?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

The spoiler alert, he made his riches during the war selling shitty parts for planes that all fell out of the sky.

During World War II?

During World War II.

And he did this on purpose.

Yeah, on purpose to make more money, he did shitty parts.

And then it's a family reunion.

I haven't seen this in 25 years, so I'm maybe getting some of the facts wrong.

But I believe all of his sons come back and they're like, Dad, you're a shitty dad?

And then he realizes that all of the kids who died in World War II were his sons.

And he should have felt paternal towards them and not had done what he did.

I'm sorry.

What did it take for this guy to feel that way?

Maybe one of them committing suicide?

I don't know.

It's one of those big like, you know, everyone yelling at each other plays.

So that was a very popular style of war.

You know, like let's get everyone in there like long days journey and tonight.

Let's head everyone in a room and have them yell.

Everyone gets a speech.

Yeah.

An actor's dream.

Oh, speeches.

And by the way, it is not an actor's dream.

When you get a big monologue and something, are you ever like, who boy?

I cannot wait.

No.

You know there's actors who are.

I'm sure there are.

But when you get the pages, aren't you like, Oh, fuck, I gotta learn a monologue.

God, I'm a fraud.

Of course I have that reaction.

As am I, as am I.

We're all frauds, dear boy.

All right.

What are we doing today?

Oh, no, but sorry for spoiling all my sons.

Yep, sorry about that.

But it's better than Star Wars spoilers, ain't it?

But it is true though that I don't feel paternal towards any actors.

Yeah.

Young men.

I don't feel that way at all.

No, no, no.

It's only young women.

Well, it's because they've been.

I'm proud of you.

It's because they've been underrepresented in certain genres of film.

That's wrong.

You know what?

I think you're fucking right.

I think it's because we're seeing more heroic characters who, you know, someone who's not just going to be a person who's like, I'm going to run around.

Oh, and also because I was a young man and like gross.

When?

I've known you for 20 years.

I don't think you've ever been one.

My life.

All right, grandpa, speaking of your life, let's hear a little bit.

I'm wearing a grandpa sweater too.

You are.

All right, let's get to it.

We're counting down your best episode of the year and this.

Oh, God.

This is episode six.

Number six.

Cheers.

All right, this is episode 349.

This is two before the first episode.

No, no, no, not the first episode, but two before the CBB, the movie episode that we heard earlier.

Okay.

This is May 4th.

May the fourth be with you.

May the fourth day they call it Star Wars day they call it.

I'm going to force you to hear about Star Wars today.

That's a U interpret it.

Yes.

This is the sixth anniversary show, the sixth anniversary show.

A big milestone.

Big milestone.

We've been doing the podcast for six years at this point.

That's what that means.

And this, okay, here are the stars on this.

Hey, shut up Scott.

How do you determine?

How many years we've been doing it?

No.

Well, I look at the sun.

Is it the anniversary of the, it's the anniversary of the very first episode being released?

Yeah, well, it was live.

The very first episode was live.

Oh, that's right.

That's right.

Yeah.

It's basically the final Monday in April or the first Monday in May.

So we're in there.

Do you remember the exact date of the first one?

I believe it was April 30th.

It might have been May 1st.

I can't recall.

Yeah.

And six years since that first one, does that do to?

Well, I'm going to ask.

Oh, okay.

Oh, please.

Thank you.

Is that, is that significant to you?

Like, is it amazing to you that you've been doing it six years?

I think so.

You know, when I was doing the old, oh boy.

Forget it.

Nice, me.

I'm sorry.

I sneeze.

I'm a human being.

I'm sorry.

With a coat on.

I'm a human being with a coat on.

Do you want me to apologize?

Like, what's your name?

Lorraine Bronco and Goodfellens?

Yes, please.

Did seeing you on the scene I'm talking about?

Yes.

Yes, go ahead.

I'm sorry.

I think when I was doing the old comedy death ray live show, I remember at the second anniversary, I was kind of saying, oh boy, that's about all I got in the tank.

Really?

On that, yeah.

And then I remember we did the fourth anniversary and people were chanting four more years at the anniversary show.

And I was like, God, I hope not.

And then...

God, I hope not.

I just, it's a lot of work.

It's a lot of work.

But those live shows, especially.

Those were a lot of work for not...

Yes.

I mean, I guess you can say there's a ton of reward in the sense if I got to laugh and hang out with people.

But...

Yeah, but it's a different thing because the live shows, it's night and day from doing the studio.

Night and day.

You are that one.

Sinatra.

You are that one.

I got to change it.

Listen, baby, I'm making my own.

I'm an unpleasant guy with a beautiful voice.

I'm going to let you know about it.

Get tired.

Instead of hiding it.

I'm going to flaunt it.

I care if this isn't...

Happy Hondo, Frankie.

I care if this is an actual thing that Sinatra said, or if it was my friend Tony...

Tony.

Imagining a Sinatra type thing.

Right.

I'm going to give somebody to sit down by saying, get tired creep.

I know, that is not a thing.

I love it though.

It's great.

Get tired creep.

It seems like a rat packy thing to say.

I do like his vocal flourishes in some songs where he'll end a song with a very curious turn of phrase that's not in the lyrics.

My favorite being in the song, it's on the Come Fly With Me album, which is thematic people all about going to different, you know, ports of call.

I'm sorry to be sniffing you.

No problem, no problem.

And there's... you can use this if you like.

Oh, that piece of printout paper?

Yeah, that.

It's out of paper.

That'll be pleasant upon your nostrils.

That's my Star Wars ticket.

To be pleasant upon your nostrils.

But on the song, it's so nice to come home to.

No, it's so nice to go traveling.

It's so nice to go traveling, is it?

It's so much nicer.

Yes, it's so nice to get home is what he's saying.

He ends it by saying, take off your slippers, put on the fire, things like this, of like, oh, this is going to be fun to do.

And then he ends it with make up pizza.

Make up pizza.

Make up it, which is so much work.

Yeah, so much work.

I mean, maybe he had a wood burning oven and presumably he had a staff.

Sure.

Yeah, oh, I forgot, he was singing with song to his staff.

Yeah, make my pizza.

Now, jizz.

Still, love it.

And I sing it all the time and cool up laughs at it every time she hears it.

So, hey.

All right, this is the sixth anniversary show.

Listen to the stars on this.

We have Paul F. Tompkins.

Oh, Lauren Lapkis.

Hi.

Neil Campbell.

Hi, Canford.

Joe Winger.

Paul Sheer.

Good year.

Aaron Whitehead.

And amazing assemblage of a comedic talent.

And this is one of our when we do the anniversary shows, I get a lot of people, a lot of comedians here and people, you know, we sort of do it in 15 minute shifts, you know, like, hey, here's your 15 minutes to shine.

And people are encouraged to stick around the entire time if they want to.

You always do that.

I believe in this one, you were playing cake boss and Lauren was playing Ho-Ho, which is a new character that she started this year.

That's right.

Whom we will hear from a little later in the countdown.

She's Santa's naughty elf.

But I want to highlight three other characters on this episode for their inclusion.

Two of them were created just for this episode and they've gone on to be...

No, I'm sorry.

One was created for this episode.

Two have been created this calendar year and this is the only time we'll hear from them, but they've popped up in episodes.

And then there was one who was on one episode previous.

So what we're going to hear is you'll hear cake boss, myself and Ho-Ho.

We're going to meet a new friend, Neil Campbell playing a gentleman named Maxwell Keeper.

That's right.

A fan favorite is safe to say.

He's just a guy who works at the Longo Watcher Fair in Florida, right?

So we're going to hear the entire first appearance of Maxwell Keeper.

We're also going to hear a new friend that we met this year.

It's Mike Campbell.

It's Mike Hanford.

These are my employees, by the way, that I see every day.

Your staff.

Make me a pizza.

Make a pizza.

Jizz.

I wish you would end with Jizz.

Jizz.

There's no one better to end a song by saying Jizz.

I think he said Jizz on stage.

It's up to you.

No, York, no.

York, New York, got it up.

Chicago, Jizz.

Okay.

Is that a teacher?

Chicago, Jizz.

So we have Mike Hanford playing John Lennon, who I'll explain him.

He came on in the American football episode in January.

Mike Hanford does a passable John Lennon, and his backstory is that...

A serviceable John Lennon.

A gentleman's serviceable John Lennon.

Another fan favorite, and this is his second appearance in his previous he explained that he was dead for five years and decided not to be dead anymore.

And then he's been...

He's just been hanging out for the last 25 years or so, or 30 years, just kind of hanging out and asking people not to let anyone know that he's alive.

Including his wife, Yoko, no.

So we'll hear from him, and then we will also talk to Brad Hammerstone, Joe Wingard as Brad Hammerstone.

Yes, yes.

Who...

His first time he was on the show the previous year, he was doing a character who was a real man's man, who you then find out is a duck.

That's right.

And in this one, he's playing a particular duck that takes me so long to catch on.

Ah, yes.

Who he is playing.

So let's hear that.

This is your number six.

Number six.

And I have a great person to introduce here on the show now.

New to the program.

Do you want to introduce yourself or should I just say...

Yes, it is I, the timekeeper.

Of course, the timekeeper.

Welcome to the show.

Yes, I observe and celebrate time.

Yes, of course you do.

And I was so excited to be here as you...

To know that you are here celebrating the passage of time.

The sun has...

Or we've revolved around the sun.

I don't know.

Yes, yes, the earth has revolved around the sun six times.

Go work, Copernicus.

How many times does the moon do it?

A million.

That seems inaccurate.

I mean, it was really fast.

Yeah, so...

I've been around long enough, you guys, since Native Americans.

Yeah, have you observed...

How old are you, timekeeper?

I am 31 years old.

You're such an ancient, ancient voice.

Oh, yes, and I wear this midnight blue cloak.

Yes.

I wear our field lining.

Yeah, why are you?

I mean, but you're just a guy.

I do like it in your 50s, maybe.

Yes, I think you're right.

I think 85.

No, no, I'm 31 years old.

Okay, well, welcome to the show.

You're just a dude.

I'm a bad, I observe time.

I celebrate time.

Okay, yeah.

I work in my brother-in-laws, watch repair store.

Oh, is there a lot of call for that these days?

Oh, yes, yes.

People get their watches repaired.

Not a lot of people watching...

Watching wares.

Wearing watches, though.

Oh, they're...

With business men and status symbol seekers.

They love having a timepiece upon their very wrist.

Like James Bond or something?

Yes, yes, and then when it's in for repair...

Still the most famous watch wearer in history.

Every time there's a new James Bond movie, it seems that's when I see the most watch ads, and it's always like him wearing it.

You know what I mean?

That's a fair point, Scott.

I mean, you never see watch ads until every three years when a Bond movie comes out.

Yeah, so when they have their watches in for repair, I call them to let them know what time it is regularly.

That's what makes you the timekeeper?

Well, no, that's just how I pay my bills, but I'm more the timekeeper in a general sense.

Wait, but so this is part of the service that you and your...

Who are you with again?

You're brother-in-law.

Your brother-in-law, yes.

Brother-in-law.

So your...

Desmond Longo.

Okay, are you married to Desmond's sister or?

No, he's married to my very sister.

Did she change her name to Longo?

Yes.

Oh, that's nice.

What was it made in name?

Keeper.

Wait a minute.

Time?

Her name is Eleanor Keeper.

Oh, okay.

What's your name?

Maxwell Keeper, the timekeeper.

Oh, okay.

Very good.

Thank you.

I thought it was going to be Tim E. Keeper.

I wish I'd... asked my parents if they could change it.

They said that was something I had to take care of myself.

Why didn't you do it?

Yeah, he just got a courthouse.

I wish I had...

The time.

The timekeeper.

Right, right.

I'm running.

Because I've spent all my time observing.

I leave none for myself.

Right.

So you and your brother-in-law are at this and that's part of your duties at the shop.

You repairs watches and while people have their watches in for repair, I call them regularly every ten minutes or so to let them know what time it is.

What time is it?

What time is it right now?

Right now?

Let me check the sun.

Wait, is this how you're doing it?

Is this why you say ten minutes or so?

Yes, yes.

I look every ten minutes of sun time and I call them and I go, well, it's now three ten.

You're in a watch repair shop.

There's plenty of what?

Well, both of you.

I've at least reliable place to tell the time.

Hey, hey, it's got oxygen, but shut up for a second.

It's time to keep a...

Can we role play what are these phone calls?

Like, let's say I'm accustomed to my drop-off by watching the long go.

This is exciting.

This is like watching an improv show.

Yes.

What are you talking about?

Improv-no, neither of you.

Neither of us.

What's wrong?

Oh, you say neither.

You're...

He's a bitch, you guy.

He's got a cloak.

I want to be the receptionist.

Oh, okay, yeah.

Don't get it.

Okay.

I drop my watch off and so you're calling me to tell every ten minutes to tell me what the time it is.

Yes.

All right, so the phone rings.

Hello?

Hello, this is the Time Store.

I have Maxwell Timekeeper.

Oh, it's time to...

Put him right through, please.

Oh, what's that?

I have some cl- some shattering in the background.

I have the Timekeeper on the phone for you.

Yes, please put him through.

Okay.

Yes, hello?

Timekeeper?

It is now 9.20am.

Honey, who are you on the phone with?

Oh, a second.

That's my wife.

Honey!

Yeah.

Who's on the phone?

Is it for me?

I'm on the phone with my watch.

Do you have a least favorite unit of time?

Oh, definitely.

12 minutes.

What?

12 minutes.

Yes, I've never been fond of 12 minutes.

A real NBA quarter, I call it.

Yeah, so you're a basketball fan, I'm getting you.

Not likely.

Oh, wait, yes or no?

No, an NBA quarter, I hate.

But you...

This is the second basketball reference you've made.

It seems like it's on your mind a lot.

Yes, it is.

I shan't remember that.

Where did you go to school?

Did you graduate from high school even?

Yes, Tallahassee High School.

Your class means like you, or are you annoying?

They hated me.

I was voted most likely to be the timekeeper.

Is that because you walked around saying you were going to vote?

Yes, it was a right in category.

Yeah, it got one.

Yes, yeah, that was from you.

Yes.

Okay, yeah.

Did you earn any other shaparletives?

At least liked.

Was that a right in category as well?

Yes, yes.

And how many votes did that get?

My sister.

Your sister.

No, Eleanor.

Eleanor.

Longo.

Eleanor, Keeper, Longo.

Nay, Longo.

Wait, no.

Nay, Keeper.

All right, don't attack the cake, boss.

Nay, Keeper.

These are naykeepers.

Yeah.

And that has been riddle me this.

Riddler.

Oh, this is a good song.

Riddler.

That was a good song.

That's a good song.

That's a really good song.

Wow, a third one.

I love it.

Oh, amazing.

We're just going to keep adding on to this.

Well, my goodness, timekeeper.

Was there anything else you wanted to say?

I love you.

Speaking of time, it's...

Oh, okay.

Don't get too excited.

He's really interested.

It's been about...

Wow, enough.

It's been about five months since we said hello to this gentleman.

Oh, wonderful amount of time.

Yeah.

How many NBA quarters would that be?

I wonder.

I have one of your calculators.

Let me go.

It's about 122.

NBA quarters in a day.

So five months.

Carry the one.

Do the two over the three.

Goodbye listeners.

Isn't that a...

That's an old John's song, is it?

Yeah.

Goodbye listeners of this podcast.

I'm like 3,980 NBA quarters since we've seen this gentleman.

What the wait?

And he was...

Don't describe your sort of bio.

Biography.

Well, you know, I could describe it or I could just say my name, but I'd rather just describe it before you.

You know, I played in a rock band.

These will be the clues I'll give the listeners.

I played in a European rock band with two guitarists, one bassist and a drummer.

And that drummer's name was my very best friend Ringo.

Okay, I'm guessing you're John Lennon.

Well, I know that because you're a city...

Because you can see me.

Yes, I'm John Lennon.

That's right.

Has it been that long since I've been on Scott?

Yeah, I mean, you were on in January, as I recall, and this is Maeve or Ma?

Certainly is.

Yeah, what have you been up to?

Now, we all remember your last appearance.

You were talking about how you've never died.

Well, I've been died for five years.

For four years, I died.

You know, I got shot through the heart outside my house.

Four years.

Fell dead right away, buried and then decided I've got to be alive again.

I like it so much.

Okay, I had you to all my questions.

So, four years of wonderful amount of time.

One could almost complete college in that time.

One could complete the presidency of the United States.

Or the presidential fitness test.

It took you that long to complete the presidential fitness test.

The visa didn't reach was hard.

Okay.

I don't mean to distract.

You don't.

No, but I do frequently.

Well, John, what have you been up to?

Well, you know, I'm just sort of preparing right now to record an album again.

What?

Wow.

A solo record or whatever?

Well, you know, let me explain it.

Of course, I'm going to take a CD that I own and record it onto a tape so I can play it in my V.

My RV.

You know, your V RV?

Oh, you know, I misspoke, you know.

Oh, look out.

Don't mean to hold your feet to the fire.

It's not allowed.

So you're going to convert it.

You have a tape deck in the RV?

Yes, it's very old RV.

So what?

I guess I'm not aware of, I never came across this in the shop room, which cataloged the CD to cassette player.

It's a pretty standard boom box that I've purchased.

Yeah, why?

Oh, so it's not even built into the RV.

It's just the boom box that's in the RV.

I'm going to do the whole thing in my home, you know.

And then bring it out to the RV, the tape, of course.

Aren't you a multi-millionaire?

Why are you buying such an old RV?

Oh, I certainly like the vintage charm of it all, you know.

Wait, what did you V stood for?

A vintage RV.

But yeah, that's right.

I didn't want to explain it.

I didn't think we had time for that.

We certainly did.

We have all the time in the world.

All right, time to keep it.

All right.

We don't really.

Oh, I'll get off the table.

What?

Did you lose all of your money when you died?

Well, I misplaced much of it, you know, because right before I died, I was taking it out.

You had bags of money when you were shot.

Yes, I was shaking it from my mattress to a bank.

Yoko finally said, you've got to put this away.

We can't get any sleep on this mattress.

We've been doing too many photo shoots on this naked on this mattress.

Well, it worked for a while because we were there so much.

We were not leaving the bed.

Yeah.

How about habit?

May I ask you a question about one of your songs?

Yes.

Eight days a week.

Typos, slip of the tongue.

What was going on there?

This is a strange question.

I'm crazy.

We were being very funny.

You know, Ringo suggested it.

I said, I brought him aside and I said, are you joking around?

Do you know that it's not eight days?

It doesn't exist eight days a week.

He said, no, John, that's a joke.

What about that song simply having a wonderful Christmas time that would piss me off?

Well, that's a ball.

I'll leave that to Paul when he's in.

You weren't on that track?

You know, I'm fuzzy on what songs I wrote.

You on every single Paul McCartney solo record?

I was at least in the room to watch him recall.

I like the pace scale.

Who was better at keeping time?

Ringo or me, the time keeper?

Or Pete Best?

Oh, that Paul Pete Best.

Tell us about it.

We lost him early, didn't we?

You didn't die.

You just quit.

You might be thinking of Stuart Sutcliffe.

Yeah, the basis.

I think I had this problem last time I was in here.

You did.

I can't remember those bloody rubbish- Well, it was a long time ago.

It was back in the 50s.

The Beatles have different drummers.

You know what?

Oh, hello.

You must be- I never paid attention.

I would think you're young, not old.

I'm a million.

Oh, then you said they've heard the Beatles, man.

Too much time I've been on this earth.

I can't listen to every song and notice who every drummer is.

Hey, that's how I feel about Bill J.

It seems like you would have one time to do that.

Time keeper could explain it.

What's your favorite song?

Time is met.

My favorite song is Elton John and seeing that Captain into Neil song.

Elton John.

If it's on backspace, it's not showing.

Don't stop breaking my heart.

Elton John and RuPaul.

Did that happen?

Yeah.

Why is that your favorite song?

I love it.

Of all time.

It's really fucking good.

Oh.

All right, did you just come?

No.

Time out.

Keep it inside.

Oh.

Wait a minute.

I'll put it back inside.

Now you can't tell me one thing and then talk about cum.

Two minutes later.

No, you just merely ask a question of what did he guess.

Did you just come?

His favorite song is about it.

Short.

You're wearing short pants.

He's wearing shorts under his cloak.

Bored shorts.

Are they from Old Navy?

Yes.

699?

Oh, yes.

Oh, my goodness.

Well, we have to get to our next guest and he's a returning guest.

He's been on the show once before and please welcome back Brad Hammerstone.

Oh, thanks for having me back, Scott.

I had to get back on the show.

Yeah, you had to.

People loved your last appearance.

Oh, that's not the reason why I'm here, but.

Oh, okay.

What's the reason?

Wait, so I don't know.

You don't care.

The show is for who's listening to it or what's happening with that.

Right.

You know, my, well, my kids found out that I did the show and, you know, it was before they were my kids.

So wait, he loved the show.

They were like, you got to get back on the show.

You did the show before you had kids?

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, he said before they were his kids.

Oh, okay.

They were someone else's kids.

All right.

Well, this is a long story.

Oh, okay.

Well, we got nothing but.

Did that put you over the edge?

Oh, no, no, I'm.

Did you.

I'm not really in a joke.

Wow.

Do you like the better when you say it or when other people say it?

Yeah.

Please, anyone answer this question?

I like just hearing it.

Yes, others more.

I prefer it when another person says it.

I already know I love time, but to hear others acknowledge it.

It's reaffirming.

All right.

Well, tell us the story about your kids.

What happened here?

All right.

Well, here's the thing.

My cousin, he got called into the Navy.

So, and he has a couple.

And he's got kids, but they're not actually his kids.

I mean, as far as I know, he's just their legal guardian, but he takes care of three, you know, kind of small anthropomorphic ducks.

And now I got to take care of them.

Right.

You say your brother was called into the Navy?

My cousin.

Your cousin is called into the Navy.

Right.

Or he joined up.

I didn't get the full story.

Who's your cousin?

I remember seeing something like this.

He's wearing a Navy outfit.

Yeah.

My cousin's name is Don.

Don't Donald.

Right.

Yeah.

Donald.

His full name is Donald.

People who may not remember you from your last appearance.

So you're a man's man.

Yeah.

Right.

Oh, real bro.

Yeah.

I'm here.

Well, I'm a classic.

I'm an old.

I'm like a Don Draper, like what men used to be.

Yeah.

You like tools and stuff.

Yeah.

Oh, you know I do.

You know it.

I don't understand them, but I'll try and use them.

How about a football phone?

Football phone.

Did you get one free ever?

Cool.

I answered the phone like a football.

Wait, how would you answer the phone like a football?

You know how like when full players get the ball in the game and they have to say hello.

Who is it?

I don't remember this.

Oh, I thought it was like you'd answer the phone and say football speaking.

Foots.

Fucking foot phone.

What I love about the football phone is you can.

Yeah.

You're a footy shaped like a football.

That's true.

Well, no, a football shaped like a foot.

We've established that.

Okay.

Your foot shaped weird and nasty.

You're very cruel.

Oh, oh.

Kickball.

You're not the boss in here.

Kick talk.

It's been a while.

Drums.

You did wrong.

I know I didn't play the drums.

But that can't be your catchphrase.

The catchphrase is drums.

It simply must be.

Your favorite Beatles Ringo.

It always has been and it always will be.

What about yourself?

No, I put Ringo way before me.

All right.

He kept the time.

All right.

Well, Brad.

I'm not going to play the song.

I'm a professional DJ and makes $70,000 a show.

Okay.

That I feel should be the thing you lead with.

No, no, no.

Not unemployed.

Trust me, it's no fun.

I got to go to Vegas this weekend.

It's just going to be a bunch of titties bouncing up and down.

Me throwing suds and putting my hands up in the air.

It's a pain.

Do you ever have to press play?

I would presume that it's on top of the show.

Yeah, I press play and then I pretend the little nubbies are working when they're talking about it.

Actually, you don't even have to press stop, right?

I bet it just elapses.

Yeah.

And it stops by itself.

Yeah, it's a ton and a half hour show.

It's pretty tight.

Yeah, I guess.

You make your own separate playlist and iTunes for the thing that you're about to say.

It's got to be tight because we got to get out of there because they usually do weddings and stuff after.

Do weddings after the concert?

Yeah, like, you know, those 4 a.m. wedding ceremonies.

No.

You guys don't go to Vegas much, do you?

No.

Yeah, well, I do.

Yeah.

How often do you go?

Every weekend.

Oh, man.

I don't know what, oh, what?

Because two shows on a weekend.

Two shows I would guess a weekend.

Where'd you get that from?

You pulled that out of here or did you hear me say that?

Well, you said 70,000 a show.

Yeah, a show.

Did I tell you how many shows I do?

You said you're there every weekend.

No, you want to put the big rich man poster on my back and watch everybody kick me in the pants.

That's what you're on.

I'm sure you do not want to do that.

Man, that's a pain.

But how much are you making?

I'm making $140,000 a weekend.

It's crazy.

So why do you say you're unemployed when you are a millionaire?

It's not a job.

You're making $5 million a year.

Oh, yeah.

You're right.

That's the very definition of a job.

Some say.

Would you give it all up though to be a pediatrician?

If you guys have any clinics that are looking, they got openings.

Yeah, I want to give back.

I want to punch some more guts back into Tits, Thummies.

That was fun.

I would suggest going back.

That was fun?

Yeah, you've never done it?

No!

You should try it, bro.

Maybe give back to the community you still came me take from.

Yeah, Camille.

You're taking all of our money.

What am I doing?

I'm paying for HBO.

Yeah.

Where does that money go to?

HBO.

Not directly in that pocket.

It was so...

No.

I see very little of it.

Yeah, right.

I would suggest maybe going door to door and trying to see if there's any sick kids and every door that you go to.

Oh, I tried it.

How does it go when you're like, hey, do you have any kids?

Let's just role play this here right now.

Okay, it's...

Okay.

Knock, knock, knock.

Okay, see, this is your first problem.

I don't know that I would hear someone saying knock, knock, knock outside my door.

Well, unless I was passing by the front door, I would literally just knock on it.

I didn't know if I was allowed to, so I was doing knock, knock, knock.

Yeah, no, go please.

Go ahead.

Yeah.

Okay, so I just, you know...

No!

You're over knocking.

That's like a cop.

You're like slamming.

You can't please.

No!

You're just a regular knock.

If someone does that in us, if I have children...

Is all our equipment okay?

Okay.

Just a re...

I don't know what you guys want from me.

We just want you act like a normal human being.

They just say, what do I do?

Okay, so I knock, knock, you say, don't say knock, knock.

So what I do is I knock on the door and that's how I do it.

Okay.

They come to the door usually in the night, gone, or whatever.

Wait, what time are you doing this?

I do.

I wait till dark.

To ask if the kids are around.

No, to ask if the kids are safe.

First they say...

Or if they think the kids are safe.

Or do you know where your children are?

First they say, do you think your kids are safe?

And based on their answer, you know, I have, I have my follow up questions that usually, do they have any illnesses or do they have any physical problems that they need help with?

Deformities.

Deformities that they need, you know, broken and set back into place.

Yeah, certainly.

Okay.

Because I got strong hands and that's, you know, a lot of people need strong hands when you're dealing with those small bones.

Do you have strong hands because of the DJ aspect of just constantly pressing play?

No, I got strong hands from fighting my way out of the sedan.

Okay, oh, we haven't even covered that.

Yeah, how did you actually get out of this?

Jesus Christ, look how dirty your table is.

Well, that's because you spilled water everywhere.

Yeah, and that moistened it so I could clean up with this paper towel.

Okay, I'm so sorry.

There's a plan, man.

So sorry, Joey.

Joey, anyway, so how are you received?

And what do you dress like, by the way, when you go to these doors?

Oh, I got what I'm wearing on now.

There's velvet tucks.

Little bag of knickknacks.

Wait, yeah, why are you carrying this bag?

What knickknacks are we talking about?

Well, let's see here.

We're open to rot.

Yeah, what do we got?

The old knickknack bag.

I got a bunch of plastic keys.

Why do you have plastic keys?

Like kids' keys?

Yeah, toddler keys.

Yeah, yeah.

One for jingling and jingling.

And two, you never know what kind of keyhole there is.

And then you could pop it in and open it up.

I don't know that plastic kids' toy keys are going to open up just any lock.

Yeah, I know.

You don't know.

So why don't you stick to what you do know, Scott?

Have the keys ever worked?

Not yet, but, you know, it's a matter of time.

Yeah.

And then lottery.

Yeah.

How many times have you won the lottery, by the way?

A couple hundred.

Yeah, so how much money do you have?

You make five million a year and you've won the lottery a hundred times.

Oh, my God.

And you've won the lottery a hundred times?

How many, how many megajou, two twenty two, I've won.

Two twenty two, how many megajou, jackpots have you won?

Let's see.

Well, I guess two hundred and sixteen of those were the megajou.

Well, the other six were just like fifty bucks, forty bucks here.

No, they're like, well, like fifty or seventy thousand dollars.

You know, because sometimes you don't get all the numbers, but you still win big.

Yeah, no, we know how the lottery works.

Yeah.

How many, how many tickets do you buy?

How many tickets have you bought in your lifetime, do you think?

Probably two twenty two.

Oh, wait, you won every time you've played?

Yeah, I mean, I guess if you want to do this, this statistics in a math, I'm buying a hundred.

No, you're batting a thousand.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, that's way better.

Oh, sweet.

Your life is awesome.

Yeah, I guess I don't know baseball.

Yeah.

Have you ever bet on a baseball game?

Yeah, once.

Which one?

The, when the Boston, when the Boston Bruins won?

Got it.

I'm just kidding.

The Boston Red Sox.

Yeah.

I bet on them when they won the latest one, I bet everything, all my lottery winnings.

So that must be a billion dollars at least.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

So you, and you won a billion dollars?

Back.

Wow.

In addition to my money coming back, trust me.

Who would take that bet another billion or?

I don't know.

Some guy.

Who was this guy?

What was his name?

His name is some guy called Bob Durst.

Bob Durst?

Wow.

It's from the chinks.

I don't know what the, I don't know.

Hey, what's up?

Do you ever have any weird conversations with him about his hobbies or things?

He's, you know, he's just telling me, you know, you know, he likes, he likes ladies.

Sure.

He likes going out and watching ladies.

And that's something I like to do.

So we've got a lot on doing that.

Okay.

Great.

But did you mention anything else he's ever done in the past?

Just that, you know, if I needed any help making someone disappear, he knew what to do.

Oh, okay.

What did you do?

Was he a magician or?

No, he was talking about my dad.

Oh my God.

Why do you say that word so weird?

That's how anybody says it.

How do you say it?

Prick.

Wait a minute.

You tell me I say something.

I'm sorry.

I apologize.

You're, I'm not a prick though.

I'm on your side.

You're, you're a pram.

You're a little, little pram.

You pushed around by the, by the man.

Okay.

Great.

Now let's get back to Silicon Valley.

Yeah.

That's why you're talking to me for all this time.

I mean, in my opinion, you're life.

You got these movie stars here.

You're like the star.

You know how, you know how much he was the Los Angeles Clippers.

It's not his Wikipedia page.

You love the Los Angeles Clippers, eh?

Yeah.

That's not as interesting as your life, I feel.

Are you kidding me?

I was, I can tell you any step from the Los Angeles Clippers.

And I'm a chapeatrician firefighter from the Sudan who fought his way out, has won the lottery 222 times.

Yes.

And it's a DJ who makes five million a year.

Yeah.

And you bet all your money.

Yes.

On a billion dollars a one game and you won it all back.

And you know Bob Durst.

Yeah.

And you think his life is more interesting?

Martin Star.

Yeah.

Are you kidding me?

Freaks and Yakes.

Holy shit.

He was in the Veronica Mars movie.

Yeah.

He's in the, the horror movie with the zombies in the snow.

That's not true.

That's true.

Dot com.

Still, it's nothing compared to your life as a movie.

My life ain't no movie.

Wait, what is happening?

Are you golemming?

Are you okay?

Wait, was the character golem based on you in the?

Yeah, of course.

I know Petey Jax for a long time.

You know Peter Jackson as well.

I know Petey Jax and I know Miss Tolkien.

We were hanging out at a barbecue altogether.

All three of us.

And they said they just listened to your voice.

They said you got something.

Well, sometimes I have a croak of my throat.

What does that sound like?

Cuz precious.

Oh wow.

That does sound just like.

Were you just talking about that movie that you had just seen?

Huh?

What movies?

Based on a novel by Sapphire?

Yeah.

That's all I was doing.

I was in the middle of eating a burger.

Yeah.

It's just my one.

Hey, and as is your right as an American citizen?

I ain't no American citizen.

You hate your knife.

You still have Sudanese?

Yeah.

What am I giving?

I love the country.

I love what's going on.

What's your favorite thing about it?

And what is going on over there?

What is going on over there?

Just a bit of cold out of genocide.

Tell us about the Sudan.

What's it like over there?

It's great if you're part of the government.

We go around going to little villages.

Wait, you were part of the government?

Oh yeah.

I was the general that gave them the idea.

Wait, so when you say you had to fight your way out of the Sudan, you're fighting the citizens?

Yeah, they were not happy.

They wanted to execute you?

Yeah.

For a little bit ethnic cleansing.

For war crimes?

Man, not.

Poll war crimes.

War and misdemeanors?

Yeah.

So great.

What?

So great.

That was a really fun one.

And Thomas, of course, became an immediate fan favorite without still here about.

He's been busy doing Silicon Valley for the past few months.

And so hasn't been able to come in, but we may hear a little bit more from him on the countdown as we go along.

We'll see.

All right.

I do want to do something special here before we go to a break and before we go to number four.

And this is a little bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bonus.

Now, there's a certain performer who the past couple of years has not.

It's like a gossip column.

Yes.

Blind item.

Who has not gotten his due on the countdown.

I think he's on a lot is always one of the best parts of every show.

But just by chance, he has not been on shows that the rest of the show has not struck a chord with the audience as much as his particular performance in them.

Like he's good, but the episodes are duds.

They're not.

They're not duds.

They're just not ones where I was like, that's what you said.

I tend to have this performer on when I know I need someone in my corner who's going to be funny the entire.

Yes.

Oh.

No.

I mean, yes.

No.

Maybe a lot of times when I don't know the person where I'm like, oh, I've never met this person before in my life.

I need someone really funny to be there with me.

I think he's gotten a short shrift in a lot of episodes.

And so he's never been voted in the countdown before.

And he ever will.

No, I believe that may change next year because of the holiday episode that we put out a couple of weeks ago.

I doubt it.

I think that's a great episode.

I think he's going to drag his own.

He's on fire.

He's not going to be in the end.

No, he's great.

I think he's great.

I think he's it's like a jinx.

You know what I mean?

You mean like a Robert Terps situation?

I mean, like Robert Terps.

He's hiccuping.

He's burping.

He's blinking a lot.

By the way, that's who I think Thomas Middleditch was sort of doing in the previous clip.

I think he was trying to do a Robert Terps.

Yes, absolutely.

Okay.

I'm of course talking about John Gabrus as Gina Lombardo.

Of course.

He's not on the top 10 this year.

He wasn't on last year.

He deserves to be.

He was in four episodes this year, including our episode from Outside Lands up in San Francisco where he just destroys.

Go listen to that on the howl app.

By the way, howl app is sorry.

Am I married to her?

The widow howl app?

The widow howl app.

Go listen to it on the widow howl app.

Well, she has a sister named howl app.

Oh my God.

Oh, howl app, cool app, do drop, go drop, bling blap, bling blap.

Hey, bling blap, get in here.

Who's there?

John is so funny as this character.

I had heard about John a while.

I'd never seen him on stage.

Several people said, hey, you got to get him on the show.

And so when I had him on, he said, oh, I really want to do this character.

Gino, who's really into Opie and Anthony.

And I went, oh, boy.

Oh, this is going to be trouble.

That's the primary character treat.

And yes, it was.

He wants to get into radio because he loves Opie and Anthony.

I went, oh, OK, well, let's try it.

Big surprise and should have been no surprise.

He's genius at it.

One of the favorite characters on this show.

And he's a really interesting guy.

And one of the sharpest improvising minds, we just had him on the bajillion show.

And everyone has gathered around the monitor just like in awe of what the stuff he was coming up with.

And he's a really, really funny guy and really puts a lot of humanity into this character who could be a piece of shit.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Oh, it's straddling the line very often, very often.

But very funny, you always root for him.

So I just wanted to do a little montage of some of the best Gino moments this year.

And this is our bonus.

Sound speeds whenever you're ready.

We started already.

Gino action.

Look, when you're in the sound business, I don't think you even say action.

You got to put it in there.

People will know when to start it and when to stop it.

All right, very good.

Hello, Gino.

Gino, my intern who comes about once a month or once every six weeks.

Well, I could use more college credits, but you're not willing to give them out.

You guys are a little stingy here.

You do not come every program.

You're supposed to be here every week.

Well, some semesters, I got to actually get in the classroom and learn about radio broadcasting.

OK, what have you learned lately?

So we did the nine credits intro to Cans.

Now when you say Cans, do you mean the film festival?

Well, no, it's three-part class.

It's three credits about the film festival, three credits about recycling, and then three credits about headphones.

OK, so the headphones one is the one that applies the most directly to the major.

The other two are just like foundational.

For those of you who's, this is their first time listening, Gino is a perilously thin radio inter- A lot of people say I sound fat on the radio.

No.

If you're listening and you're assuming I'm over 300 pounds, you're incorrect.

What do you weigh?

You weigh like a buck 20.

I'm up to 124 because I've been drinking a gallon a whole milk a day.

OK, it's called the Go-Mat diet.

Yeah, you got to drink some of those naked juices and like just eat, you know, constantly eat ice.

Oh, I drink tons of juice, fully nude.

I'm confused.

What would you recommend?

I'd recommend you drink juice only naked because if you spill it, then you can lap it up.

Exactly.

If you spill it in the right place.

Oh, girl, you got something.

You're reaching to the choir now.

All right.

What have you been up to, Gino?

Oh, me, a lot of things I saw.

Have you ever seen the film?

Citizen Kane.

That's the one I have seen that.

Yes, yes.

Have you seen that?

Yeah.

A classic film, in my opinion.

It's the one with the guy from the Animani X cartoons.

Yes.

That's, I love that movie.

I didn't know they did a spin off into a black away film.

It was pretty good.

And honestly, way less sledding than I thought there was going to be in that movie.

They're what, you know, you tune into a film like that and you're like, Rosebud, we know it's a sled.

Let's see some fucking sledding.

Let's see some 360s, some 180s.

Yeah, like all kinds of, I like stunts sledding myself.

See some Dollykicks.

So I saw that movie.

Yeah.

And that's about all that's really happened to me in the last six weeks.

That's it.

Yeah, really.

And that was by accident.

What kind of accident did I was jerking off my living room and my mom came home from work and I jumped behind the couch and then her and a date sat down and watched this and came but I couldn't get up and leave.

So I watched it through a crack in the sectional for like two and a half hours.

Okay.

I got found out at the end because I was weeping.

I was like, it is this sled and I started crying and then my mom's new boy.

The loss of childhood innocence.

Yes.

See, your relation to that theme.

Yeah, well, I took a nine credit theme course.

Oh, really?

So it's three credits about theme parks, three credits about like theme show theme songs.

Yeah, yeah.

And the Simpsons.

Yeah.

Oh shit.

I wrote my final on that.

Really?

That line because I was like, it's important because it gets out the title of the show.

Yeah.

And it was in the show as well.

Just the title.

Yeah.

Meet his boy, but that's a weird lyric.

It really is.

I was just home for fourth of July back in Long Island.

Went down to my mom as a cabana down in Malibu.

We went down there, shot off some fireworks.

Malibu Long Island.

Malibu is a little beach club down in Long Beach.

I didn't know there was a Malibu.

Yeah.

There's all kinds.

You know, there's a, there's a Paris in Texas.

There's all kinds of different cities in different places than you're supposed to be.

You got a boo down in L.I.

You got a boo.

We hanging at the boat down in Long Island, bro.

So how long were you there?

Did you fly you in the morning of the fourth and then right back out after the fireworks?

Yeah, I got in there.

I took a red eye on the third and I came back.

So I landed there for the July.

I was there at like 7 a.m. and I took a 4 p.m. flight home on Fourth of July.

Why?

Jump to see your mom from LaGuardia to Malibu.

It's like a 45 minute ride.

So I was in and out, you know, it was because I saw fireworks.

I made my parents, I made my mom do fireworks before it's sundown.

So I could see him.

Well, did you see any fireworks?

I saw some proverbial fireworks, like metaphorical fireworks and a barely saw some actual fireworks and little fireworks.

What were the proverbial and metaphorical ones that all trouble at home?

My uncle's gotten a big brawl again this year.

Oh no, when you say your uncles, who are these?

These are my dad's brother and my stepdad's brother.

So my uncle and my step uncle, Mitch and Jimmy.

And they know each other.

They are brothers.

Really?

How did this happen?

They're both adopted from the same.

It's very, very common.

They're both adopted.

They're both adopted by the same woman, but they found later on in life that one of them was my stepdad's brother and one of them was my dad's, my real dad's brother.

So okay.

So they found out that they were related to each other or that they are technically not like blood not related to each other, but they were adopted by the same mother.

So they consider themselves brothers, but turns out they're both brothers to my stepdad and that separately.

Wow.

Technically I have, and they're sort of Eskimo brothers too.

They're Eskimo brothers.

Yes.

They both fuck the same girl.

And that girl was, you know who was, Darlene from Roseanne.

Oh.

Really?

Darlene the blonde to the brunette.

I feel like Darlene was Sarah Gilbert perhaps, which I don't think would be possible.

Why wouldn't that be possible?

I mean, it's possible.

Anything's possible in this world.

Hey, dude, you tell me.

Probable.

Van Halen could win a VMA.

My two uncles can fuck Darlene.

So a lot of fighting, what was the issue between them?

They were doing the Roman candles shoot off thing, you know, where they hold the garbage candle lid and Roman candle and kind of shoot at each other and block it and shit.

And my uncle has...

Like true Roman like jousting and...

Yeah, Roman jousting is like one of the most classic forms of combat.

And we were shooting at...

They were shooting Roman candles at each other, hitting my uncle in the eye, you know, his eye as the woman.

He only has one eye?

He only has one eye.

What happened to the other?

Just one middle of his head.

Like a cyclops?

Right?

But it's super big.

So it's hard to tell if it's one or two, you know.

He ever think about putting a flesh patch in the middle of that thing and turn it in to two.

Yeah, he wears a fake nose in between it, but it still looks fucked up.

He has a fake nose above his real nose?

Yeah, it's a fake nose extender.

It's like the top, it makes the bridge of his nose longer.

Okay, so it looks like the nostrils which are down at the bottom of the nose as far as I'm concerned.

Yeah, well, look, I'm not going to go out on a limb here and tell you where you're going to go.

The nostrils might be.

But for me, they're at the bottom of my nose.

How does he get the fake nose extender on?

Is it with glasses or is it just some sort of prosthetic?

Yeah, but he calls it a glass.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, yeah.

Sure.

Okay, so he got shot in his one eye.

He got shot in the one eye with the Roman candle.

He gets all pissed.

He pants his my eye.

He's like, that's my only eye.

That's actually what he said.

It's weird that you knew that.

He said, hey, that's my only eye.

He runs over and he pants his Mitch, Mitch's pissed.

So he decks Jimmy.

Jimmy falls down to the ground.

He lands on his back.

Okay.

Yeah, and that's his one back.

Thanks for pointing to your back.

I've nowhere that was.

So it's not, you see here?

Yeah.

Okay, that's here.

No, that's, yeah.

And then about here starts a side.

Yeah.

And then after the side is the back.

You are so incredibly thin, by the way.

You were able to wrap your arms around your body twice.

Yeah, yeah, well, that's it.

And then this is my other side.

Oh my God.

How are you?

And then this is the front again.

You have to gain some weight, you know.

I worry about you.

I just can't.

I'm really thin.

It's good for me to be this thin though, because then I could just sit in coach and I'm so comfortable and I have coach.

Yeah, on a plane.

Oh, I thought you were saying sit and coach.

Well, like you were coaching.

Well, that's actually, that's funny to bring that up because on a plane is when I do a lot of my coaching.

Really?

You do it via Skype or Skype?

Yeah, I Skype in if I hope that I can get Wi-Fi in the end.

Sure.

And then I do some life coaching and some basketball coach.

Uh-huh.

And some bass running drills.

Bass running jumps for my basketball team because, you know, a lot of carry over.

Running is good in a lot of sports I learned.

Yeah.

Please welcome Alicia Witte.

Hi.

Hello.

Welcome to the show.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, Scott.

Hello.

Nice to meet you.

Gina, right?

Gina is my sister's name and my mother's name.

Wait, your mother's name and your sister's name is Gina.

You haven't talked about this before.

Yeah, Gina and Gina and Gina.

Does anyone call you Jeannie?

Uh, my grandmother did, but she passed.

So, okay.

No one else.

Why did she pass?

What did she pass from?

Why did she pass?

Because God told her, hey, it's your time, babe.

And what she passed from was getting hit by a car.

Okay.

That.

I won't mention it.

My grandfather was driving.

Okay.

Well, this is a bad story.

Yeah.

It's a good story, a sad story though.

Kind of like Rudy.

Yeah.

Okay.

I don't sleep with anyone that I don't love.

Yeah.

That's my thing.

Have you ever slept with anyone?

No, not yet.

Really?

You still have your V card?

Um, well, technically I slept with one.

A2M doesn't count.

I don't know that right.

Oh shit.

Well, then yeah, I got, I've got my V card, but not my A card.

Okay.

When you say technically, what happened to you?

Um, I hooked up with my babysitter when I was like 15 or 16.

Why do you have a babysitter when you're 15?

Because I always fucking stub my time.

When my parents would leave the house, the first thing I'd do would be sprint around the house in my socks even when I was in high school.

And I would slip and fall or stub my tongue all the time.

Hired this 12 year old girl from the neighborhood.

Wait, is she younger than you?

She was younger than me, but I was 15.

So it's not that weird.

Okay.

And she like did some kind of weird, she seduced me.

It was very uncomfortable.

I'm not getting into it on this radio show.

Okay.

I'm not talking from here on out.

I actually forgot about that.

Okay.

Thank you.

Yeah.

All right, that's Gino.

We need to go to a break and we come back.

We will have your number four episode of the year.

Comedy bang bang, we're back here.

We're back here.

We're our final segment of this episode and we are cracking the top four.

We're going to crack a new top something each time we do one of these.

It's exciting.

It's exciting to think about.

Yeah.

Like this time we're cracking the top four next we'll be talking.

Oh, it's amazing.

Now this of course is your number four.

Number four.

This is episode 338 from March 9th, March 9th.

And this is an episode entitled Be My Guest Literally.

Oh snap.

Oh yeah.

It's on now.

Like Donkey Kong.

Now this is.

Get with it, Donkey Kong.

Get to be more like Donkey Kong.

Come on.

This is, let me give some backstory of this episode.

You know what you're listening to.

The widow howl app, she is in the middle of directing her first documentary about her life.

It's called Origin Story.

So there will be more documentaries.

I don't know.

There will be blood.

Well you said first documentary.

That's true.

Well it could be first and last.

Just covering bases?

Covering, I'm a base cover.

You know that.

I'm a base cover.

Watch your bases get covered.

She had an indiegogo for the film to help finance the post process for it.

And we did one thing which we, I don't think we've ever done it before.

Maybe we, no, no, we've done, but we've done auctions.

And normally when we were doing them for the LA Food Bank in some of the old death ray shows.

So this is one of those.

But we did a, if anyone bid a certain amount of money on the indiegogo campaign, they could sit in on the recording of an episode.

And they could pick their favorite people that they wanted on the episode.

And if I could get those people to do it within a reasonable amount of time and in a time that this person could fly to LA and be on the episode, then I would arrange that.

So you couldn't do it within a certain amount of time.

Then he is released from all prior commitments to me.

He keeps his money.

So I was really incentivized to do this.

Of course you hate, you hate to part with money.

I hate to part with money.

I like it coming in.

I hate it going out.

I want that pill.

So a gentleman named Michael Abelson, he won and he got to pick his guests.

And here are the guests he picked.

He picked you, of course, Paul of Tonkins.

He picked Lauren Lapkis and he picked Andy Daly.

Him.

A murderers row of murderers, let alone comedians.

We have all murdered people.

Yes, with your bare hands.

Yeah.

You hate to put on gloves while you do it.

It just feels better.

It doesn't feel right.

It doesn't feel the same.

You know what I mean?

I can't feel it the same way.

Yeah, they make thin gloves.

There are some gels and stuff.

So much sensitivity in your fingertips.

I just really want to murder someone without wearing gloves.

Come on, baby.

I want to be inside you murdering you.

I want to be stronger inside you.

So he picked you guys and Paul, you decide you wanted to do Werner Herzog before we started.

Lauren Lapkis picked Ho-Ho.

We have heard from recently the Naughty Elf and we'll hear a lot more of Ho-Ho in this episode than in the previous clip.

Andy Daly picked a new character, at least new to comedy bang bang, the French actor Jean Claude Pepe.

We're not going to hear a lot from Jean Claude Pepe.

He's going to dip in this clip, but it's really funny.

You should check that out.

And then one interesting part of this episode is that you, Paul, kept getting calls on your phone.

Was it a new phone?

New phone who did?

I don't think it was a new phone who did situation.

I think I had the, oh, here's what it was.

I wanted to do, I wanted to get the FaceTime sound as a cue.

And I kept in trying to do that.

I kept making it noise.

And taking it off silence.

Yes.

Okay.

So your phone rang.

So no one was actually trying to contact me at all.

We hear your phone ring several times in this, which led to, because Ho-Ho was here, and this is March, by the way, before March, it led to us saying that it was Santa calling, and this is the inception of your Santa Claus character.

And so we're going to hear a little bits from this episode.

It starts off where we're talking to Ho-Ho and then Santa calls in and then we're going to do a time jump and Jean-Claude Pepis will already be there.

And we're going to hear the pre and post, would you rather, which leads to an unforgettable conclusion?

This is your number four.

Yeah.

Number four.

How does Cambridge, Massachusetts compare to Cambridge, England?

They are very similar.

It was actually went to both of them.

So it was easy to get my mail forwarded if I did that transition.

And yeah, pretty much the same.

It would also be very easy.

Your mail mixed up.

Hold on one minute.

Yes.

So you're saying by just the presence of the word Cambridge, end your name being affixed to the top.

It found its way much like a child writing a letter to Santa Claus just addressing it to North Pole.

It finds him no matter where he is.

That's not really how it works, actually.

Whoa.

That's not really how that works.

Who is it?

Who is this strange creature?

I don't see anyone at the table.

I don't see your mail down.

Hello.

I don't think there's any reason to look down.

No, there is next to me.

I can see it.

I don't like looking down.

What?

Tiny, spiky creature.

Oh my goodness.

Wait, I am looking down.

Now it's Ho Ho.

Now I've got my legs wrapped around the microphone.

Ho Ho.

The naughty elf.

I'm naughty.

Did you just appear because you heard the mention of the North Pole in Santa Claus?

Yeah.

Have you been here the entire show?

I will.

Show show.

Fine, show show.

But when I was listening to your conversation, I heard you improperly tell about how the mail gets to Santa.

Forgive me a strange supernatural creature.

I meant no disrespect.

Let me introduce you.

I'm terrified of this thing.

Yeah, I can imagine it's a genderless...

I'm from the future.

Oh.

When your tongue came out, I couldn't have been noticed it was as long as you're entire body.

It is.

Two wishes and a dream.

Oh my goodness.

A Werner, let me introduce you.

This is Ho Ho the naughty elf.

Santa, you see...

A help.

Does not give gifts to naughty little boys and girls.

But Ho Ho the elf found that there was a need from these children.

They wanted...

It's a bead!

A crack cocaine in their stoggings.

These bad little boys and girls needed presents because what is Christmas without presents?

So she will give...

Whatever, whatever, you'll never get it right.

I'm a bit confused on the concept because I don't understand what is the point of giving the good little girls and boys toys to reward their behavior.

Everyone deserves Christmas.

Yeah, bad little boys and bad little girls get knives and shives and guns and machetes.

But those are still considered gifts are the end.

They can use them to kill each other and their family.

That was a lot of throwing up there.

That seems a strange thing for Santa to condone.

Yeah, Santa actually hired you.

We talked about that last time you were on the show.

Yeah, he's got a lot on his plate.

I had to take over the bad kids.

What was the system in place previous to your hiring?

They got nothing, just coal.

But they did get coal so they did get a gift.

They got something.

It seemed safer to give them the coal than to give them the machetes or the crack cocaine.

I don't know.

I mean, coal throughout history has been used to stone people to death.

Is that true at all?

Maybe.

When the little bad boys and girls got coal?

Pardon me, whole thing.

No, no.

I would like to pursue this idea that throughout history coal was used to stone people.

Look, if not as hard as a rock, but it's hotter.

So it was hot coals.

Yes.

People were warming up in barbecue grill.

Yes.

You know what?

Let me pause for a second.

I need to stone this person to death.

For heresy?

Certainly.

For crimes against humanity.

And so the coals...

I crave your indulgence.

How do you throw up when you hear something that you were attracted to in terms of your general aesthetic?

No, no, you think you're out.

They throw ups in a row.

This is like a Morse code of throw ups.

Yeah, figure this out.

Blah, blah, blah, blah.

Is it funky very much?

Fuck you very much.

Oh, oh.

It's not that kind of show.

Show.

I've heard you say this before, but there is no evidence to support your claim.

There really is not.

This is not that kind of show.

I think it kind of has turned into this kind of a show.

It turned into...

Over the years.

Didn't mean to start out that way.

Who's your friend?

Okay, this is Michael Abelson.

Oh, I know you.

You're bad.

Oh, Michael.

Be able to boom.

I'm not even listening.

Am I on the list?

Yeah, you are.

I didn't get my present last year.

I did receive a machete in the mail, but I did order that.

So I didn't know.

I put it in the mail.

Why do you think you ordered it?

Good point.

Yeah, you know.

Yeah, you were naughty.

So yeah, Michael is kind of a bad boy.

But you know, for the listener out there, he's got a lot of money.

He showed up here wearing a leather jacket and cool sunglasses.

He rode up on the motorcycle.

Yeah.

He healed into the dove-off and I watched.

And it just went crashing into the building.

It costs a lot of structural damage, I believe.

He doesn't care.

He's got a do to blow.

Blow blow.

So yeah, so he's one of the naughty kids.

How long has he been on the naughty list, Ho Ho?

You're on the naughty list from day one.

You pop out and you're naughty.

It's born inside you.

It's an original sin situation.

Yeah, original sin you never washed away.

Sorry, I just want to clarify.

That's just me or is that the nationwide, that's the situation.

That's the rule.

Okay.

So when people pop out of the close-ups of the woman's vagina with all of the disgusting blood and everything.

Yeah, the bile coming out of her piss.

Then the child is just naturally bad and will never change.

Yeah, depending on if it's bad or good.

Oh sure.

Maybe it depends on what the mommy hasn't figured it out yet.

You have no scientific study on this.

We're not scientists.

I'm a naughty elf.

But there could be some link between the mother's diet and whether or not the child is born inherently bad or good.

Yeah, maybe she'd teach Thai food.

Okay, so stay away from the Thai food for the moment, young boy.

Don't we have no empirical evidence to the contrary or.

Thai food perhaps.

Yeah, yeah, maybe exclusively Thai food.

We don't know.

Children in Thailand are born bad.

Zero.

Okay, well, this I feel as if we have a lot of evidence at this point.

So really you never get out there to Thailand?

I don't have to go.

They're all good.

All I do is make charities and stupid shit I hate.

Seems like a lot of people on the naughty list go to Thailand.

Yeah, from America.

Yeah, they do.

Yeah, they want to see the ping pong balls.

We know what you're talking about.

You want me to explain who helped?

Go ahead.

Well, when a woman loves a man, she seeks a ping pong ball upper.

HUHA!

Shoot today.

It's an idea.

It's a mouth and back and forth until eternity and everyone dies.

This is how you familiar with the beginning of the story, but not the ending.

By the way, is Werner on your naughty list?

He has been, but he got off it.

Wow, I thought that you were on it until the end of time.

He's the exception of the rule.

Because he made a movie I liked.

Which one?

Which film was this?

Boyhood.

He didn't make a shot.

Oh, okay, sorry, sorry, sorry.

Yeah, boy, Werner Herzog's boyhood.

I hope everyone enjoyed all five hours of it.

Working with Patricia Arquette was a dream come true.

I wonder what it's like to be just a boy and not a boy integral at the same time.

Oh, is that your dream eventually to be just a boy, much like Pinocchio?

Oh, my dream is to live on a rainbow and barf all day and night.

You'll get there.

Where do you live now again?

I live inside Santa.

Inside him?

Where?

Well, he has a little vest on.

You can't see it.

He went to Vest Point.

Yeah, we've talked about that.

And they go inside a little pocket.

It's literally inside his body, but it's kind of on his person.

Okay.

And you're very close to him.

Does he know what you're up to on a day-to-day basis?

Yeah, we Skype all day long.

Okay.

Do you want to talk to him?

Yeah, I would love to.

Let me see if he's busy.

All right, here we go.

Let's see.

He's busy.

Try him again.

I would love to see out over here.

Yeah.

Yeah, he's busy.

He's not answering.

Wait.

Incoming Santa call.

Hold on.

Let me press it.

Oh, what's going on?

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

I'm just over here doing cabbie bang bang for fun.

Oh, that filthy show?

Yeah, I make it filthy, bleh.

You're not the only one.

It's one of those kinds of shows.

You listen though, huh?

No, of course I do.

I have to kill a lot of time around the workshop.

Why do you think he's always laughing and so jolly?

Oh, who's that in the background?

Oh, hi.

This is Scott Augerman.

Oh, no.

How?

Not a fan?

Well, you know, I mean, you get great guests.

But you know, my skills are a little lacking.

I think, you know, you've come a long way I think.

It's a yearly day.

It's still not quite there.

I get it.

Well, I mean, you know, it's like I get white people like you.

Yeah, but it's an acquired taste.

Yeah.

That you have not acquired yet.

That's right.

Where's Mrs. Claus still looking hot?

Well, oh, we've talked about this.

That's not my, not my favorite thing when you say those sort of suggestive things about Mrs.

Claus.

Is she still hot though?

She's very attractive, yes, they can.

Yeah.

One time I got stuck between your kids.

Now, that was private.

Oh, wait, why were you stuck between Mrs. Claus?

I said, what were you doing in there and why is it private to Mr. Claus?

Well, if it was your wife, would you want to talk?

Well, you probably would.

But I think most people, if it was their wives, they wouldn't want it all.

I think, well, what else didn't happen?

Santa, while I have you on the phone, we have a bad little boy here on the phone.

Oh, no.

He's wondering if he can possibly be the second exception to the rule, much like Werner Herzog, and get off the naughty list.

His name is Michael Abelson.

Now...

The corporate lawyer?

Yes, originally from Cambridge, but then he moved to Cambridge just to not confuse you.

Okay, gotta go!

Wait, wait, no!

He's gone!

He wants to signal, due to him hanging up.

Oh, sorry, Michael.

Could we please explain to Santa that I did recently donate to an indie GoGo campaign for a very good cause?

Yeah!

Oh, how campaign?

Oh, go go!

What if...

Oh, go...

Oh, if you had an indie GoGo campaign, what would you fund?

Well, I'm trying to get one off the ground, actually.

Oh, tell us all about it.

Leave no detail out.

I'm making a documentary about my life, but...

Wow, you're...

And you've lived a long time.

I think we talked about that.

Yeah, hundreds of years.

Definitely hundreds.

Centuries, one might say.

Yeah, some might say that.

But I want to have...

I have a lot of home videos from that time, and I want to piece them together and make a really cool documentary about my life and what it's like to live on the North Pole.

You have home videos from hundreds of years ago?

Yeah!

Centuries, some might say.

I made flip books in my whole life!

Oh!

So there are home videos of drawings that you made of flip books that you then when home video was invented.

With a flip cam, yeah!

Oh, I see.

The flip book is a lost art.

My first attempt at making the film Strode's Equusi flip book was it now?

It's very hard to make one big enough for a theatre full of people to see.

And you have to have a big thumb!

Much less than a little bit.

It took the thumbs of several dozen people, but in the end they could not coordinate properly.

Oh, sorry.

And they dropped the book and four people were crushed.

Oh my goodness.

Yeah, like that.

Something a good day.

You seem like a very contrary person.

I like people die.

Is that your favorite day when you go to a funeral?

Yeah, like you're watching.

Laugh, laugh, laugh.

What's the funniest funeral you ever went to?

It was a baby.

It's pretty good.

It was an innocent baby.

Yeah, at least likely to happen.

So I think that's hysterical.

Very good.

Oh, very good.

Oh, I don't know what it is about you.

You're disgusting.

You're small.

You're genderless.

But I love you.

You seem mean to be.

I don't love me.

I'm a ha ha.

It's just a quote from Tylersons, I think.

I don't know.

Tylersons is the ABC show?

Yeah, it's like the whole show just worked.

It quoted from Tylersons.

Then, didn't you work on that show?

Yes, I did.

I was the one that made sure that all of the characters were something that no one ever wanted to see.

That they were very discomforting and that you would never enjoy watching them on a regular basis.

Have you seen the finale?

No, my boy.

I watch it.

I watch it once a month to remind myself why I do what I do.

Yeah, I love how it's all about how dinosaurs are going to become extinct because of all this bad stuff people doing.

I think that's funny.

And maybe historically inaccurate.

Yeah, maybe.

Maybe not.

Not the bubble.

Boo.

Do not fly away after that.

Yeah.

By the way, is there something that can trigger you flying away?

Yeah, but oh, you'll know when it happens.

Okay, very good.

Maybe it'll happen by the end of the show.

We...

Oh, wait.

Come back.

Oh.

I just...

Oh, I got her his little tiny foot dragging it down.

Oh, my gosh, bitch.

What did we do?

I don't know.

It seemed like we just paused and you flew away.

Whatever you said did it.

I can't remember anymore.

Neither.

Oh, well.

All right.

Time to play, would you rather?

We, of course, know how to play this.

Michael, you know how to...

What is that?

Is Santa calling?

Santa?

I answered.

Oh, yeah.

Hey.

Are you guys playing a game?

Oh, yeah, we're playing, would you rather?

Oh, can I play too?

Oh, I love for you.

I'm in a game.

Oh, it's listed.

I love games.

Oh, what's your favorite game?

Uh, Jack's.

I'm gonna say, reindeer games.

That's his favorite movie.

Boy, that would have been a...

I wish I'd said that.

Did you...

Have you seen the movie reindeer games?

That's me.

How many times have you...

What?

Oh.

Not good?

It's all right.

You know, it's watchable.

Mm-hmm.

How many times have you seen Hoop Dream, Santa?

Oh, Hoop Dream.

You know what?

It makes me cry every time, but I can't stop watching it.

Is your favorite singer Kevin Rudolph?

I don't even know who that is.

You know who a little Wayne's guitarist?

Oh, little Wayne's guitarist.

Is his favorite singer?

He's not for a singing.

Well, he's saying two solo songs.

Oh, okay.

What are those songs?

I'll check them out.

Uh, something about like, we're gonna start it or something like that.

Sure.

Memorable.

Are they on Spotify?

We're gonna start it.

Something like that.

We're gonna start it.

Rock.

Oh, let it rock or something like that.

That's pretty good.

Yep.

Check it out.

You don't like a nun of it.

Okay.

I'm gonna skip card for Christmas.

From who?

Me.

Wait a minute.

You're on the naughty list?

Yeah.

How about that?

Isn't that a sheet of gifts?

Yeah.

Terrible.

Is it possible to make that in your toy workshop?

I don't get kind of...

I wouldn't make them, but they're not valid.

I see.

But I make them code.

That's frustrating.

What did you do to get on the naughty list?

Or I guess you have been since you were born?

Yeah.

Original sin.

Oh my goodness.

It's not a good deal.

Is it a lot like, uh, original sin that's derived from Cain and Abel?

I feel like I'm taking up too much of the God for a sick way.

Cain and Abel.

Isn't that the original sin?

The first murder?

That's right.

Well, I guess there's Adam and Eve.

That was the original sin.

They ate a bite of the...

I don't consider that to be the original sin.

That's not as bad as murder.

No.

I mean the first one.

That's why Santa made up Christmas, because he felt so bad about how bad he was.

He wanted me to be good at the world.

That's why I made up Christmas.

But listen, you know, God did say specifically don't eat the apple.

He never told anybody not to murder.

Well, that was a good point.

That's true.

That had to be set down in stone sometime later.

Like, oh God, guess what, guys?

I also don't like that.

Was God sort of like, oh man, I forgot about the murder.

I should have said something.

All right.

I'm not going to punish you guys.

I think he thought it was just understood.

Yeah, it should be.

We don't murder each other.

What if murder was okay?

I love it.

This is a good screenplay.

John Claude, would you like to be in this?

A screenplay in which murder was okay?

Well, no, the guy, the first line is what if murder was okay?

Yeah.

And the second line is, hey, shut up.

And then it has a different plot.

I don't know what the plot is yet.

Well, keep working on it.

Okay, can I contact you when I help that?

Absolutely, yes.

It's a very intriguing first exchange of dialogue.

Oh boy, I have an actor.

I have a director on board.

I have a plot.

And I have a plot.

I have a plot.

The plot.

You need a plot.

Okay.

What would you say?

You said it's not going to be about that.

Right.

So really, it's about these puppies who all learn how to play soccer.

There's nothing in the rule book about that.

I know.

That's what it would be crazy.

There's also nothing in the rule book that says puppies can't murder.

There's nowhere in the Bible.

That's true.

Puppies are allowed to do anything they want.

The Bible is just a handbook for human beings, not for animals.

That's true.

Wow.

What if puppies wanted to murder people?

I wonder what they do.

Who says they do?

Oh my gosh.

Yes, Anna.

Have you ever tried to have fun with a puppy that is gnawing on your hands and you're like, hey, take it easy, dude.

I just want to pet you.

100% of that is accurate to my life.

This is, I think, Santa Claus is onto something.

And he's on something.

I don't want to bring it back to me but for the proof that nature hates us.

Very good.

Good one, winner.

I like thinking you the Bible is a handbook.

I think penthouse is a handbook, if you know what I mean.

Yeah, I do know what you mean.

I love that.

Yeah, me too.

Oh, double ho ho.

That's rare.

It looks like at one point Michael labels and you are a winner.

Congratulations.

That's how we play, would you rather?

What a bunch of bullshit.

Santa.

Dude.

Not fair.

Whatever, bro.

Dude, and bro?

Yeah.

Please not talk during the would you rather anything.

I've never established that you can't talk during me anything.

Come on.

It's a fair point.

Come on, Michael.

I just feel like you.

You're so off the company.

The exterior could be gingerbread, you know, even if every other part of it.

John Kond get off of it.

It's food.

It's not going to survive the climate of the north fucking pole.

That's absurd, where you put things in a refrigerator.

I'm to help them survive.

I think the cookies would be fine.

I think there's kind of a difference between your fridge at home and the fucking north pole.

No, no, no.

I'm just an important creature who lives there.

There's no wildlife in your fridge to nibble on these walls as well.

Yeah, good one's got a good one's got a good one's got a good one's got a good one's got a back of me.

Okay.

Why are you being so sarcastic?

I'm backing you up.

You son of a bitch.

How much wildlife do you think is eating gingerbread at the north pole?

I don't know a fucking raccoon or something.

A raccoon.

A snow raccoon.

Oh, come on.

Oh, hell hell.

I would fight you.

Why don't you come down here?

Oh, a fucking fight.

Why don't you get down here right now?

Take your goddamn stupid sleigh with your stupid reindeer, Dasher dancer and all that.

I'll throw up the sash and I'll kick your fucking ass with it.

Okay, make sure you got your neck cap on because here I come hanging up right now.

Okay.

All right.

Very good.

I can't wait for Santa to show up.

That seems like a mistake.

You think so?

Really?

Does he wait?

Oh, does he have special powers of any sort?

Yeah.

Oh, shit.

Well, the fact that he cannot die will make him fearless enough.

Oh, no.

He has nothing to do with that.

He didn't think about that.

He can't even die for murder.

He also is very well padded with all of his layers and layers of fat.

Oh, I didn't think about this.

I wonder if I can get out of this fight.

Oh, shit.

No, nobody in here.

Of course it took him no time at all.

Look at this candy ass motherfucker.

You want to fight Santa?

Is that what I fucking heard over FaceTime?

Because I'm ready to go.

Brosef?

S-s-s-s-santa.

I think that we had a bad connection.

You certainly didn't hear that.

Oh, really?

Let's see if this is a bad connection.

Oh, God.

Yeah.

How do you like it?

Is this connecting?

Oh, I'm connecting with you.

Oh, how safely?

Oh, yeah.

Right.

Watch this.

Yeah.

Oh, that's right.

Oh, get in there.

Jean-Claude, why are you joining in?

Well, it's just that I have this important shoot tomorrow for Geico, and I don't want to get too risk being bruised.

You're going anywhere.

Everyone named Jean-Claude likes to fight.

And to Ableson, why are you throwing punches?

But listen, if you're a personal injury lawyer when it's all done, I'd be happy to help you out.

That's not your field.

Ow!

Die!

Oh, it does not feel good to just stand here and watch him and be beat with death by Santa Claus on an L. But I don't see that I have a bitter option.

I found an English person three mythical creatures.

Werner, what are you doing?

I'm recording all of this.

Is this your next film?

Like Grizzly Man?

The fingers crossed.

Oh, god.

This is terrible.

Had enough.

I think I have.

All right.

Remember that next time.

It's Adam.

Sorry.

You're saying shit.

See you at home.

Oh, well.

Santa, why did you throw three dollar bills down at me on the ground?

Hey!

Lou, what am I doing?

What am I doing right now?

You're touching your...

I'm laying your fingers.

I'm signing my nose.

Goodbye!

Hahaha!

Number four.

Wow.

Why me what else can you say?

What else can you say but W-O-W?

Wow should be spelled U-U-U-U shouldn't it?

Let's get rid of the W.

Why do you say that?

Because get rid of the W. Just make it two U's.

Wow!

I don't like it.

Abulion!

Varymillion!

You vermin!

The most millions of vermin crawling all over you.

The most beautiful word of the English language.

What a great clip.

That may be my...

Personally, that...

Is that my number one?

I know.

That stuff coming up is so good but that's a great clip.

That show might be my number one.

That was so much fun.

That was such a good show.

It was so much fun to get to play with Lauren and Andy at the same time.

Yeah.

And Michael.

He was great.

You always anytime you put out one of these, hey, come be on the show things you're like, oh don't be annoying.

And he was great.

He was fantastic.

You know, like came in at all the right moments.

Yeah.

You know, it was really fun to be.

When in doubt lay out he knew when he knew when to jump in there.

A lesson I've never learned.

Nor my...

Nor my lesson is...

Nor my way.

Nor my Donald.

Nor my personage.

So that was great.

That was so much fun.

Oh, and there's also a guy animated a clip from that.

Animated, essentially that clip where Santa Claus shows up at the studio.

Drew Lang-la-la-la?

Lang-la?

DRUE.

Lala.

Last...

Abudia.

I'm assuming it's a man by the way.

I don't know.

Sure.

Okay.

It could be a girl named Drew.

You can't start too low when you're doing Johnny Cash.

Jizz.

Baker Pizza.

Jizz.

Oh, wait, wait.

It's the last name.

Get a load of this last name.

Where'd it go?

How did I lose it when we were singing?

How did I lose it?

Get a load of this guy.

Last name, L-A-N-G-L-O-I-S.

I don't even know how to do that.

Lang-a-la-la-la?

Is it LEGO-la-la-la-la-la?

It's LEGO-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

Oh, no.

Remember when they found that alpha on that plane?

Yeah.

Remember that cross?

What do you call those?

Cross over.

All right.

We got to wrap it up here for this episode.

But when we come back on Thursday, New Year's Eve, by the way, what do you do in New Year's Eve?

Listen to us, I hope.

What a great New Year's Eve.

When we come back on that episode, we're going to count down your top three.

That's exciting.

That is exciting.

I'm going to take you out here with...this was a really beautiful version of...we mentioned them before, mentioned them before with John Lennon.

But American football sang an acoustic version of their song Never Meant, which a lot of people had only heard in the electric version.

So this was...

I only heard the drums part at Soundcheck at that show one time.

Right.

We were trying to do a show.

Listen to that episode to hear all the back story.

But I really liked this performance, so we're going to play you out on that.

This is American Football Never Meant.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.

Bye.

Yeah!

Let's just forgive.

Everything says.

And everything we did.

Best friends and better hands.

Good, fun, good.

And I'm going to take you out here with me.

I'm going to take you out here with me.

And I'm going to take you out here with me.

I'm going to take you out here with me.

Don't say never to.

Not to be.

Overly dramatic.

I just think it's best.

You can't miss what you forget.

So let's just pretend.

Everything in.

Anything between you and me.

Was never a man.

I'm going to take you out here with me.
