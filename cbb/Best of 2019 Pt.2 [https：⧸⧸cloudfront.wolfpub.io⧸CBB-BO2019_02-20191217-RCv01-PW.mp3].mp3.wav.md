♪♪ Tickle me Bob, Bo's in Call Me Marie.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Thank you to Commander Ostigo.

Commander Ostigo.

Congrats on your promotion.

I feel like people are now shooting to be an Alimony Tony character by you.

Not gonna do it.

Commander Ostigo, try again.

Sorry Commander Ostigo.

Alimony Tony is something we may be talking about later.

Maybe not.

Who knows?

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

This is Best of 2019, part two.

Part two.

Why don't you take me?

What?

That is a big audio dynamite reference that I believe you ask about every year when I do it every year.

Yeah.

This is part two?

Yes.

Kevin is showing me three fingers up.

I believe trying to communicate that it is part two to me.

No, he's just mistaken.

It is part two.

Why would you think it's part three?

I don't want to hear you on Mike.

All right.

He's just mistaken.

But this is part two.

He's just mistaken.

Episode two, as they call it, part two of four.

We are counting down your top 15 plus one live episodes of Comedy Bang Bang.

And on this episode, we are going to be hearing your choices for the 11th, the 10th, the 9th, and the live episode.

So shut up and take your medicine.

Yeah.

This is it.

Kevin, are you embarrassed that you got it wrong or were you trying to communicate something different?

He's proud that he got it wrong.

All right.

Go.

I'll let he's just saying, oh, just move on.

It's like puffing out his chest like, yeah, I got it wrong.

He loves it.

What a weird.

He's like strutting around like a peacock now.

He's high stepping.

Look at him.

He's off stepping.

He's hot stepper.

Hot stepper.

Welcome to the show.

My name is Scott Ockerman.

And I'm the host of Comedy Bang Bang and this is...

I'm Paul Tompkins.

I'm the guest of Comedy Bang Bang.

Yes, sir.

You are.

And we do this every year.

This is the 11th time we've done it.

The show has been going on for 10 years and seven months at this point.

Weird.

Weird stuff.

That is weird.

Wild stuff.

What a life we have lived together.

It's true.

And separately, ain't nothing to sneeze at.

Wait, no.

I think I almost think that the lives we've lived separately are even better than the life we've lived together.

Probably.

Yeah, because most of the life we've lived together has been in this room.

Yeah.

We've been...

Scott, by this point, we've been in so many different...

Kevin is just stimulating so wildly at this moment.

Stop it.

He's like going...

He's like doing this.

What is...

What's going on?

I don't know what is going on.

I don't want to know.

Ryan is cracking up.

I don't even want to know and yet they're moving around.

They're laughing themselves silly at this point.

I don't know.

I don't know what's happening.

They're treating us like Hollywood handbook treats them.

I don't like it.

I don't know that reference because I don't listen to Hollywood handbook.

Be sure.

It's fun.

No thank you.

The boys.

Those men.

Welcome to the show, Comedy Bang Bang.

This is episode 204.

If you did not hear the previous best of episode, let me just break down a little bit of what you're going to hear.

Comedy Bang Bang is a show, a comedy show where I hosted every week and I have comedians on and actors and people promoting things, musicians.

They play themselves or they are interviewed as themselves and they are themselves during the show.

I also have comedians who are on as fake people or sometimes they're real people but they're not the people that they say they are.

Does that make sense?

No.

Break it down.

So let me use the Werner Herzog analogy again.

As I did in the previous episode, Paul F here sometimes plays Werner Herzog on the show who is a real person but it is not Werner Herzog.

It is Paul F Tonkin's playing Werner Herzog.

Let's trick you.

You are also a leprechaun, are you not?

Yeah.

I know that's reductive.

They love playing tricks.

We love playing tricks.

That's leprechaun's whole thing.

Playing tricks.

Of course they have their own shoes at me.

Then I have to repair them.

What a strange bit of folklore.

What twisted mind comes up with something like that?

I feel like legends like that always come out of somebody who doesn't want to do something.

Yeah, I don't want to repair these shoes.

What's the way for leprechaun's come along and throw them at them?

They have to do it.

Really?

Yeah.

It's weird.

Take my shoes.

Well, I wanted to use them tomorrow if that was but...

Well, you can.

But...

So I'll just see a leprechaun?

Hopefully tonight.

Probably.

Throw it at him?

Yeah.

And if he doesn't repair them?

You get his gold.

Well, that's cool.

That's a pretty good deal.

You have to find it.

Where?

Where are you sitting at?

Where is he usually hiding?

Someplace tricky.

I imagine a fancy handwritten font.

Oh yeah.

Ooh la la.

Sex.

I think Ooh la la is very fancy script and then sex is like 70s sort of...

Yeah.

You know.

Now we're designing the shirts.

I love it.

Yeah.

Makes it easier.

Get a little off the top.

No way.

Like...

This...

What we're doing here today...

Oh yeah, I described the show.

So that's the show.

Essentially we're going to be hearing clips from the shows where comedians are playing these fake people.

And we have a good time and we do this every year and you have a good time listening to us.

Yeah.

So shut up.

So stop bothering us.

I hate this battle that we go through every year.

And now Kevin by the way is like sipping from his mug like he's baby Yoda over here.

He's doing it two handed.

He's baby Yoda over here.

But that's the thing.

He's stealing focus so much.

He's like lifting it up.

Like he's lifting baby Simba and the Lion King above his head or something.

Did you know I'm a year older than baby Yoda?

When they're talking about like boy he's so old to be that young.

They say baby Yoda is 50 years old.

Yeah.

I'm like baby Yoda.

You are a baby.

Aren't I?

You're the baby Yoda of the alternative comedy scene from the mid 90s through now.

That's right.

I have gigantic eyes and ears.

I'm touching stuff in the ship.

I'm not supposed to touch.

You're not supposed to touch.

You're wearing a robe, a bathrobe.

I would love to wear a bathrobe all the time.

All the time.

Yeah.

Use the access baby.

As easy he once said.

About bathrobes?

Is that what I was talking about?

I think it was about sweatpants or something.

I can't recall exactly what it was.

So squalid.

Easy access.

So Paul's taken a little drink and Scott was talking at the same time.

So that dispels that rumor.

It's true.

I'm not doing the polytompkins character.

That's right.

And Scott is not a wooden dummy.

Not at all.

Not at least.

A little bit.

No wood anywhere near my body.

None of your body's made of wood?

No.

I'm allergic to wood.

All wood.

Yes.

Trees.

I know what you're saying.

Like trees.

Yeah.

Trees.

That's where wood comes from.

There's trees in the city.

Yeah.

Trees in the city.

Yeah.

Two.

Which character are you?

I'm a Samantha.

I'm a maple.

So essentially what happens on these episodes is this is this.

Paul and I descend into madness doing it over several hours on one day.

Yeah.

So these come out on four separate days over the course of two weeks.

But what we are recording takes place in one long ass recording session.

And so by the end of it by episode four we don't make any sense.

And neither do you.

Yeah.

Neither do you.

Listener.

So fuck you.

You don't make any sense either.

How do you wish?

Why should we?

How do you?

If you're not going to make any sense.

You guys expect us to wear asses.

Which way bust our asses to make sense?

Stop making sense.

Dollars and cents my dear boy.

Cha-ching.

For these t-shirts.

That's a film.

Yep.

All the t-shirts.

Ula Lasex.

That's going to be a big seller.

Ula Lasex.

I think it is.

And the four billies.

That actually is one that I think.

I'm making an amendment to the four billies.

The Noah's Ark panel should have like a circle as if indicating that's the ghost.

Circles of the ghost.

Yeah.

In like red.

Yeah.

So we are talking about this.

We are talking about what we knew we would get to Cosby.

We're doing the top 15 this year as well as one live episode.

We had a separate poll for the live episodes.

Which we've done maybe 12 of or 15 somewhere in somewhere in that range.

12.

How do you know?

I missed the first part of your sentence.

You're just saying 12.

I was talking about disciples.

Yeah.

Of our Lord.

Yeah.

We've done 12.

We counted him down.

Number one with a bullet.

Judas.

No.

That's surprising.

Come on.

Peter is number one.

The rock upon which Jesus builds church.

Certainly.

Did he deny Jesus three times?

Yeah.

How can he get number one?

No, the disciples are perfect.

Well, Judas is the most famous.

So he gets number one.

I think he should be 12.

I think he's the.

He's the least disciple.

Because of the.

Because of the whole.

The trail.

Because of the whole silver thing.

30 pieces of it.

I wish I could make him number 30 for all of those silver pieces.

Yeah.

Number 30 and then number 11 Thomas, the Dowling disciple.

Who are the mid-tier disciples?

I don't even remember some of Luke.

Luke.

What did Luke ever do?

I can't remember who the 12 apostles are now.

Because the authors of the gospels.

Yeah.

I don't know if those are the apostles.

Right.

Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

I don't think John was a disciple.

Don't look taken away.

They run.

Yeah.

Saint John to the divine.

I don't believe so.

Anyway, it's been way too long since we've been in a church.

Yeah, man.

It's been a while.

Let's go to church tomorrow.

Do you know what?

I loved midnight mass when I was a kid.

Yeah.

I loved it.

You live tweet midnight mass on Christmas.

Do you not?

By the way, Christmas just happened yesterday.

So Merry Christmas Boxing Day to you.

Merry Boxing Day to everyone.

Occasionally these episodes land upon Christmas or Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.

This year they do not.

This is the 26th.

This is boxing day.

It is boxing day.

Yes.

Did everyone get a box?

You're just talking about Christmas.

Yeah.

Get that box instead of getting that box.

Get that box.

I want that box.

What's in the box?

That's what I do.

Every Christmas present I open.

You scream.

I hold up.

What in the box?

Then I open it up and I say, oh, this was on the box.

Thank you.

Gloves.

I start a gloves.

How many gloves do you own?

Three.

If I could ever find that fourth one.

Oh, man.

I have a few pairs of gloves.

That I am.

For a person who lives in Los Angeles.

Yeah.

I only find occasion to use them if I ever travel outside of town.

Exactly.

Have you ever worn a glove here in Los Angeles for any reason?

For the stage of course.

For the stage.

That's saying the role of the glove man.

Yes.

I am the glove man.

Hear me hear my words.

My hands.

Are they not warm?

My phone.

Can I not not use it?

But in your personal life, I don't.

You're a person who would wear gloves and I don't know that you ever.

It's just never get that cold here.

It never does.

When I wore it when we were in New York, it was very cold.

I wore gloves there.

That's usually when I will buy a glove.

I will find myself in a last year around this time.

I was in Tokyo and it was very, very cold.

I was like, oh shit, I need gloves.

And then I'll have to find a store that has them somewhere.

See, we have a bankers box with all our winter accessories.

Oh, and your phone.

And that no, that's a safety deposit box.

Oh, OK.

What's a bankers box?

It's the when you get fired.

It's this box you put all your stuff in.

Craggers boxes like, you know, pre-made, you know, file boxes.

And we have scarves and hats and gloves in there.

Hats and gloves.

Fun.

It is fun.

It's a fun box.

But you hardly ever get that box down.

It's a fun box.

I don't even wear like a scarf usually.

I should wear more scarves.

I will wear it.

Scarves is a good thing to have here because it can get cold.

It can get a bit chilly.

And you got to protect your neck.

You got Wu Tang.

But the only problem with weather in Los Angeles, and I hope we're making everyone jealous and want to move here, is the fact that it starts off hot.

And then when it comes around to be time for a scarf, you haven't left the house with a scarf because it started out so hot.

Am I making sense?

Or you are stopped making sense.

No, you have started making sense.

Finally.

And you have to plon ahead because there are certain times of you where you know desert climate, it's going to drop down to get cold.

How cold do you think it's going to be here tonight?

One.

Oh, an elephant walked in the room.

All right.

Do you want to get to it?

Should we get to it?

Yeah, man.

What to it?

We should.

Let's get to it.

This is your number 11.

Number one.

One.

All right.

Click number 11.

All right.

Click number 11.

Sit down.

Shut up and be played.

Clip number 11.

This is from episode number five hundred and eight nine five hundred and eight nine.

Five hundred and eighty nine from March fourth.

Five hundred and eighty nine episodes.

This is the one.

That's the one that's called episode of five eight nine.

This is an episode called where wolf with all scary where wolf with all.

This is scary.

This is a frightening episode.

This should be the title alone is giving me the chills of the grave.

Joe chills.

I'm going to drink your blood.

I've got to drink your blood.

I'm going to marry your mama.

Oceans 11.

Oceans 11 reference since we've been going as many episodes.

Second Caesar Romero reference as well.

This is episode.

You played the joke.

You did.

Do you think that what if Adam West drank his blood drink Caesar Romero's blood in heaven now that they're both dead.

They are about finally I can drink your blood.

What have you got up to heaven and they were if you were like look I want to do this on earth but finally I can drink your blood.

There's no rules here.

You can do whatever you want.

Heaven's great.

It's the opposite of hell.

Drink your fucking blood.

What is just anarchy up there.

There have to be rules.

That's my heaven.

That is just.

There's got to be like some sort of I mean there's a there's a caste system certainly.

What if do what thou wilt is the whole of the law.

So just anyone's doing anything.

That's right.

I don't know.

Heaven sounds boring.

Doesn't it?

Like I like I like here it's like you go to bed and you wake up and you do a bunch of stuff and then you go to bed again.

It's like it's you know.

I wish you'd said this before I wasted all my money on indulgences for you.

Oh no.

I went to Pope Francis and I said I want to buy my friend Scott's way into him.

You did.

You went all the way to Vatican City?

Yes.

Take me down there.

Take me down to Vatican City where the popes are green and the popes are pretty.

I want to go.

What about the two popes?

The movie.

The two popes are fun.

That's why it's called the two popes the movie.

I saw a poster for it where the one of the quotes from a review was an undeniable triumph.

Wow.

What a weird thing to say.

If anyone denies me like Peter tonight our Lord.

Yeah.

Talk about undeniable.

Our Lord.

Our Lord wasn't even undeniable.

This guy's new age.

Peter did it.

They're like, nah, I'm pretty sure that it was you that was with Jesus.

He's like, oh.

To ask someone three times you're basically like calling bullshit on him.

Yeah.

Like they knew the first time I'm going to ask you one more time and give me a fucking straight answer here.

Do you know this guy?

Do you know him?

I only want what you have done.

I went into Yosemite.

You went into the proper thing.

I've been in that show.

I did probably 60 performances of that show and I don't know.

Why did you play again?

I played Anis both times.

I was in two different productions, one in 1989, one in 1991.

Which one?

Anis is one of the priests, Kaiifices.

What do we do about Jesus of Nazareth?

How do we handle the cup of the key?

Great voices.

Yeah.

Great voices.

Good oldies.

Who, the two of us?

Or them?

No, I'm in us.

I'm in us, imitating them.

Okay so this is werewolf with all and the two performers other than myself who are on this episode are Patton Oswalt and Andy Daly.

There we go.

Heavy hitters.

Now Patton Oswalt comes by the show.

He's been on the show many times.

He comes by the show honest.

I believe the first pairing of these two people was early on.

I can't recall what episode it was but Patton and Andy liked to do it together a lot.

Ula Lossiks.

So they've been doing it for 10 years at this point together and Ula Lossiks.

And on this episode Patton came by to promote AP Bio and it did not work because it got cancelled.

But it got picked up by somebody else.

Yes.

So you know stars out there?

Come on the show and your show can get cancelled.

Great show by the way.

I really enjoy it.

It's a great show.

Great cast.

Great writer, creator who's been on the show.

Mike O'Brien has been on this show several times and a lot of good people over there.

So Patton...

It's been not good enough to put us on the show.

Nope.

Certainly not.

Could be that good.

I mean I know I'm off her only but how about one of those offers?

So Patton is himself and Andy Daley is playing one of his oldest characters who's been on the show many times.

Dalton Wilcox, poet laureate of the West.

And the one thing that you know have to know about this episode is previously Patton and I got into some sort of a discussion regarding the movie series King Kong.

And all I remember from it is that we were discussing whether King Kong had done anything wrong.

Whether or not he can be blamed.

Yeah.

Maybe?

I don't know.

That's all I remember.

But it comes up in this clip.

So let's hear it.

This is your episode number 11.

Number one.

One.

He is an author and primarily a poet.

Please welcome back to the show.

Oh this is Dalton Wilcox.

Welcome back.

How's it going?

Hello gentlemen.

Hello.

It's great to be here.

Hi.

Nice to see you again.

Yeah well for sure it is.

I can't remember Patton have you ever met Dalton?

I think I did.

I was trying to show with him a long time ago.

It's fascinating.

Right.

Okay.

I'm going to be here and I'm just a hell of a lot going on with me.

A hell of a lot going on until you guys are all about.

Okay.

No I mean I'm anxious about it because I have a lot of distortion.

But they were just telling me outside you guys was having a conversation regarding the subject of whether that King Kong had done anything wrong.

Oh that's right.

Now for those of you who have not heard Dalton Wilcox.

He is a poet.

He is a cowboy.

Cowboy.

He is the cowboy poet of the.

You're underselling my qualifications.

Oh sorry do you want to lay in and sultingly?

I think you're pardon.

I'm just merely working off of memory.

Do you want to keep big in my pardon?

I'll see if I give it to you.

I am the poet laureate of the West.

I have been referred to as that by myself and sometimes others.

I am the.

But when they do it it's usually he calls himself the poet laureate of the West.

I've heard it in a context like that from time to time or other things like he considers himself to be poet laureate of the West.

Well it is ever saying in my opinion he is.

Right.

I've heard that opinion yet.

Anyone offered the opinion that I am the poet laureate of the West?

I've certainly heard the opinion that I believe I am.

That is a commonly expressed opinion.

I am the most celebrated collector and chronicler of the wit and wisdom of the West that the world has ever seen and that's a fact and you can look that up on the world book.

And world that's right there in the world book.

I am also the author of the psychodeticism.

Maybe I've missed that world.

You don't know the world book?

Maybe not.

It's got everything in it.

Everything in the world about the entire world.

Well they wouldn't call it the world book.

Well let's write and they put it in the world.

Are you talking about the internet?

Well they did put it on a computer.

Is that what you're asking?

Okay I don't know what I'm asking.

The world book is on the computer.

That's true.

All right.

It's all all all of them.

CD ROMs.

You can get an all any kind of a ROM.

And anyway I have written up the you know I'm the author of the book you must buy your wife at least as much jewelry as you buy your horse and other poems and observations humorous and otherwise from a life on the range as well as the follow up book you still have to buy your wife at least as much jewelry as you buy your horse and even more poems and additional observations humorous and otherwise from a life still being lived on the range by Dalton Wilcox who wrote the first book.

That's also wrote the first book excuse me.

But then it's then this is by Dalton Wilcox.

By Dalton Wilcox.

After the Dalton Wilcox.

That's correct.

By Dalton Wilcox who also wrote the last book by Dalton Wilcox.

By Dalton Wilcox.

Okay yeah.

Of course we know these things about you.

Yeah and those books are available for pre-order on Amazon.

They're on free orders.

They haven't come out yet or not.

I don't know what it means but they're available for pre-order B Dalton's and the Amazon books.

All right.

So yeah I thought these copies had come out already.

Well they've been out a long time.

Okay.

We're like a post-order.

Well as far as I'm concerned you could still pre-order because you haven't gotten it yet.

You understand?

Yeah.

Okay.

You're right.

That's pre-order.

Okay.

Yeah.

And then of course you've got to order it too.

These are poems that you wrote about about your life on your trusty steed traveling across the American West.

They're not all about me on my horse but they are mostly primarily do take place in the American West.

The real West, goddamn it.

Right.

Not this bullshit West that we're in now.

This goddamn Hollywood West.

This is bullshit West.

And one thing that I wanted to mention and this ties into what you wanted to bring up is that a lot of your poems have to do with you encountering people along your various travels.

Not people my friend.

I wish I was encountering.

Yes.

Well in my eyes or at least at first glance they appear to be people and to you you find them to be monsters such as vampires, wolf men.

I can't recall if you've ever wandered into meeting a Frankenstein.

Certainly I am.

Really?

Absolutely.

One of my most famous.

Very his body parts.

One of my most famous poems is titled I One Time Killed a Frankenstein.

And I've encountered numerous Frankenstein's.

This is gentleman is it unfortunate condition of my life that I am plagued by vampires and also mummies and oftentimes where wolves.

And these they tend to congregate in the western part of the United States.

Well I reckon they're probably all over the place but I because I happen to be in the West and we're a fine him.

I'm very very very vigilant about monsters.

I always have my eye out for it.

Matter of fact I killed the Cyclops today.

I killed the Cyclops earlier.

Really here in Hollywood.

Here in Hollywood.

What were the circumstances?

Yeah.

Well what do you mean it was the Cyclops so it's kind of circumstance you'd expect.

So did the Cyclops come up to you?

Did the Cyclops approach you at all?

Well I had called him.

Here's what it is.

Wait.

Yeah.

I got a flat tire on my truck.

Okay.

All right.

I don't know if you guys know anything about trucks but it's just like usually run on four wheels.

Well it's just like a car.

I was gonna say just like a car.

Just like a car.

And you can keep things in there.

That's a truck.

And we have them out in the real West.

And anyways I was driving my truck and I got a flat tire and that'll happen because it's I don't know.

I don't even know if you gentlemen know anything about cars.

Well the tires tend to be inflated to a certain.

That's right.

The full air.

That's right.

I'm surprised you know that they're made of rubber these tires.

Yeah.

Real times yeah.

And from time to time you'll get them they'll go flat on you.

And I called up a tow truck come out and you don't have to change those by the way.

I know that you were about to.

We know all about those trucks.

You know what a tow truck.

Yes.

We do.

They also work with automobiles.

So Patton and I are locked in on that.

Yeah.

All right.

You're surprised me with your breath and knowledge.

Anyway guy comes out and I didn't even think anything over the first but he's got an iPad John.

I didn't even think one thing of it.

And he starts changing my tire and he did it.

He put it up on the jack and all that stuff and he changed my tire.

And then I said well thank you Fran.

Have a good day.

He tells me he wants 50 goddamn dollars.

Surprisingly cheap for a truck deal.

Fifty fifty dollars is cheap to you gentlemen.

The charge you got that triple A member.

You don't understand I had the spare tire on the truck.

He's not providing the tire.

He's literally just providing the labor.

Why didn't you do it yourself then if you already had it.

Yes cowboy don't you know.

You know yeah.

No listen gentlemen.

If it was a horse I'd know how to change his shoe.

Right.

But I'm not going to mess around with his goddamn by the side of the road here in the Hollywood with all you crazy drivers.

You needed someone's electrical right.

Yeah.

Because you don't know how to change his time.

Damn it I know how to do it.

I sure as hell you don't want to be bothered.

Not only do I know how to do it but I stood over that some bitch's shoulder and I told him again and again how he's doing it wrong.

Oh.

And he was.

Just for that I would want fifty dollars.

Yeah.

In a number of ways doing it too slow and sloppy.

How long was he there?

There well he took check them like 15 minutes I'd say.

Anyhow fifty fifty goddamn dollars he wanted.

I told him I'll give you five.

Well.

Just.

And did you mean give him five like like you know.

Well that's what I was going to do.

He had agreed to the five dollars I was slapped him five and sent him on his way.

But he didn't agree to it.

I thought he was going to say all right that's fair and I'd say put out your hand I just gave you five.

But.

Yeah.

Yeah but it didn't work.

And that son of a bitch got real hot under the collar.

He starts getting mad and that's when I realized goddamn it dawd why didn't you say it.

Son of a bitch has one eye.

This is a goddamn cyclops.

The cyclops.

And how did you how did you take care of the side.

Well I was concerned because I know I there's no time to waste once you've gotten into a altercation of any kind of a cyclops it's just a matter of time before he smash a rock over your head.

That's the cyclops is they don't have extra ordinary strength.

Yeah sure they do.

They do.

Goddamn cyclops has built the pyramids.

You don't know one thing about cyclops.

Well I got all I know is they have one eye and maybe they're taller than other.

So you crop a lip.

Well hang on I need it I'm sorry.

He had an eye patch.

Oh yeah.

So he had a cyclops just has the one eye in the forehead.

Oh right.

Sounds like this guy had to I.

Did this cyclops mention having just taken a trip to the optometrist at all or.

Yeah I don't know I mean he said something about coming to an eye doctor but.

That's he yeah I think that's what I mean is optometrist.

He said he screwed me I'm just coming to eye doctor.

And I just thought I don't have time for small talk change my time.

You didn't have time.

I have no time for small talk.

Anyway you're you're you're positing that there was an eye under that patch or there are you what I'm saying is he was a sorry would he would have just started with one eye and that's it.

Right.

And this guy sounds like he started with two.

Well it's you do you think if you turn into a cyclops is that I don't think that I'm not a fucking idiot but the extent of your ignorance about cyclops is right.

He's been extremely ignorant.

I apologize for patent patent.

I'm going to ask you to turn it down.

I understand but yeah if you was a cyclops and you didn't want people to know you was I think a real good strategy would be to put an eye patch over the blank page place on your head where I might plausibly be understand where I might plausibly be.

It makes sense.

I'm saying if I was to lift up that eye patch there wouldn't be a goddamn die.

Did you lift up that eye.

Well now this is here's the story.

I could see that son of a bit scanning around for a rock to smash over my head and I said I don't have time to wait.

You were okay with the rock being smashed over your head you just didn't have time for it.

I don't have time to recover from a rock being smashed on my head.

Take me an hour out an hour and a half at least.

Well anyways I pulled my six guns and I fired a silver bullet right into his heart.

Wow.

Dropped that cyclops down and then I'm about I'm about getting ready to get out of there right.

Sure.

But I did think well let me just confirm my suspicions and I lifted up his eye patch and that son of a bitch had gone to the extent of carving a hole in his goddamn head and putting in there fucked up looking eye and I thought to myself this son of a bitch he's under deep cover as a human.

Wow.

Going the extra mile going the extra goddamn.

Wow.

Incredible.

Where was this was this over like on sunset and like over across the street over here because I heard a news story about someone with a gun.

Oh did you.

Right.

Well you know where I was I was down a gourgulch.

Oh of course you're always a gourgulch.

I'm a time whenever I come to this gun for sake and see.

Nice karaoke over there.

It's the only place where I feel at home is gourgulch.

Yeah well I would imagine why.

The Denny's there.

Yeah the Denny's.

Lots of good folks over there at the Denny's.

What do we got the Denny's the thrifties.

Well since they closed the pioneer chicken on Pico there's really no that's the last you got that right.

Yeah you can see Morton Denny Jr's autograph in the sidewalk.

You know it's really weird how I just rewatched the ballot of Buster Scruggs.

Oh you must have loved that.

I cared for it.

Yep you did you like that.

There were no monsters in that.

No.

As I recall.

So was that factually inaccurate or is that kind of how the West was.

Well well no that was yeah yeah I mean.

You know what the chances are.

It's interesting you say there was no monsters in that movie because I've.

You believe there were.

Oh but they're worried.

I don't remember them.

I don't remember.

You have to know to look for them.

The fella at the bank was a tin man.

A tin man.

What?

Is that a type of monster?

Yeah I know.

Is that from Wizard of Oz?

A tin man was a monster?

Yeah the tin man was a goddamn monster.

I just thought he sang and wanted to be in love.

Oh well this is a goddamn problem all the time when the movies gets us back to King Kong.

They are always constantly depicting monsters and movies of various favor of their lives and glamorizing the monster lifestyle and that's a prime example.

I guess the scarecrow would be terrifying if you actually met him.

Try to imagine it for a moment.

You're walking down a brick road of any color.

Doesn't have to be yellow but in your imagination you could make it that.

And all of a sudden a goddamn man hops off of a pole and he's full of straw.

That's a goddamn monster.

That wouldn't tell him come with me.

I'm going to the green city.

I'd fucking burn him alive.

Wizard of Oz would be very different were you to start.

Yeah I would like to see that movie.

I would love it if you landed in Munchkin.

How would you?

Wow you're journeyed.

Yeah first of all that would be amazing.

First of all the Munchkins.

Yeah all just them.

You take out your six shooters.

You have to wipe out that whole village.

Yeah just genocide of the Munchkin people.

Yeah I wouldn't waste it so much time getting around to killing that witch neither.

You seem very concerned about wasting time lately.

Yeah.

Since your last appearance.

You're going on or?

I'm real busy.

I've been busy these days.

I've been real busy.

So no but it's more like you don't want to get monsters to jump.

Once you know there's a wicked witch hanging around you know you don't have you don't move around.

Who cares who's on whose side.

Let's just kill them all and let God sort of a sisley.

Once that wicked witch shows up starts talking about my dog.

I'm going to kill him.

Do you have a dog do you have any pets?

No I don't have a dog because the chances of a dog you know morphing into.

A vampire are strong.

Right or merging with some sort of satanic spirits and yeah unfortunately it just happens.

I mean it doesn't happen every time but one in ten.

But what's the safest pet to own then what's the pet that leads likely to turn into a monster then?

To be honest with you there is no you cannot get rid of the risk.

Then a pet is going to shape shift into a monster of any kind.

You might think because I had a collection of butterflies at one time and they all turned into monsters.

I just I had to tear off their wings one night.

You ever think this has gotten me this has led me to start thinking about koojo.

They say satanic dog.

Do you ever think that your truck might be a monster like Christine you know it's got a flat tire.

I think about it all the time and that's why I leave it locked up every night in a vault.

I keep my truck into truck size vault which I had to make space.

Is this like the dealer no deal vault or the banker sits atop?

I'm not familiar with how I man deal.

He's not the banker.

No no no no although that would have twist that would be if suddenly the very last episode to dealer no deal.

He's been a banker all along.

Son of a bitch that would be terrifying.

Yep let's get back to King Kong what did you want to say about Hey Stole a goddamn woman.

What do you mean he didn't do anything wrong.

Son of a bitch Stole a goddamn woman for whatever eight purposes he had in mind for her which by the way we never did know.

And I'm fine with that kill him before we find out what he wants with this woman.

You seem to have a sliding scale of morality.

Yeah you mean by stealing the lives of various things.

I'm not yours I'm killing.

Yeah but making the world safe by slaying monsters.

Let him this tiny woman could be a monster.

You're telling me your boy you're taking the monster side in this one.

You sure maybe monsters do regard us as monsters but it's our job to know we're not and they are.

Okay I'm not a monster I know you're looking at me with a side eye right now.

Very suspiciously you know I'm not a monster you've been on the show several times.

Yeah I think you know I have I've met you a number of times if you're a monster your attack is slow.

The slowest I mean you've been on this show for ten years.

Playing a very long game.

Playing a long game which I wouldn't try to lure you into a false sense of complacency perhaps.

Yep.

But no that's not me I'm just I'm merely a human being ever have been ever since the day I came out of my you know how babies are born mothers vagina.

Well there's no no way to go that way but I understand.

Really I mean the stomach yeah sometimes yeah.

Well just to be safe and no offense I am going to bury a stake of wood in your heart.

Please don't.

Not at the end of the we till the end of the show at the very least if you go.

Oh of course I will I'll wait till the end.

Number one one.

Oh number eleven.

How did you do it?

Oh we love.

Third Ocean's eleven reference Paul and I saw that movie together.

Yes we did.

The original.

You keep referencing the original.

It's a strange movie.

It is a boring movie.

It is too.

It's very boring.

Plus hours.

Yeah.

And it's unlike the these are the ocean's eleven series that Steve directed.

Steve.

He did a good job of those those are all exciting for the most part and the original Ocean's eleven is boring.

Yeah it's boring.

There's a bunch of rich people hanging out together.

There is no.

But there's no fun to be had in any of the heists and they take a long time and they don't do them simultaneously they do them one at a time.

It's also the key part of the heist.

Heist is based on the flimsiest idea of there being a standard of how long it takes to sing the song Old Lang's Eye.

I don't recall that really.

Yes that's all I've seen.

All I've seen that song eight minutes and twenty three seconds.

Somebody asks one of the characters says how long does it take to sing the song and then has an answer that it takes like one minute forty seconds.

Oh one minute forty seconds.

So in one minute forty seconds they can do this these parts of the heist.

That is ridiculous.

Absolutely ridiculous.

But check it out.

Like imagine if you were singing a happy birthday and you're like we got to hurry.

We only have this about the time it's singing in.

It doesn't make any sense.

But Caesar Romero is very funny in it and a certain point says I'm going to marry your mama and then snaps while extending his fingers.

Yes.

Which we all instantly tried to do after the show and I've been trying to do it for twenty some odd years now.

It's very hard to do.

How about our old friend Dallas Raines incorporated that?

I wish.

Dallas we know you're listening because you've been changing it up just for us.

There's no other excuse.

There's no other explanation for why he's changing up.

Maybe some people have snitched tagged us talking to him or something.

Don't snitch tag guys.

No snitch tags get snitched tags.

Yeah.

All right that was episode eleven.

We got to go to a break when we come back.

We are cracking the top ten.

This is exciting.

We're going to see the TT.

Oh my gosh.

Here we go.

We'll be right back with more comedy.

Here we go.

Here we go to a commercial.

How fun is this?

Welcome back.

How many bang bang?

Best of.

Welcome back.

Best of.

Scott can I introduce you to a game?

Sure.

By the way you took out the snowman over here.

Yes.

I thought you were going to introduce you.

I thought you were going to introduce you to a friend.

Well in a way the office is decorated for the holidays.

With care.

Well.

Well they hung the stockings with care.

The stock is running with care.

Everything else is just like in a pile.

Yeah.

Get out of the pile.

It's just a pile of Christmas decorations.

We discover this while recording the neighborhood listen.

The snowman toy.

New episodes coming out in 2020 I hope.

That's correct.

That's right.

Well season two in 2020.

Great.

You press this little snow hand and then he sings let it snow and he swivels.

He turns around.

Oh okay.

When he ends up looking at you.

If he stops.

Because he stops.

Okay so if he looks at me while while in motion.

I think he turns four times.

Okay.

And then stops.

Four times.

I tell thee this.

But when he looks at you it's very satisfying and weirdly validating.

Okay.

All right.

So it's not a game.

It's just something fun.

It could be a drinking game.

It could be.

Yeah.

Okay.

We're adults.

I mean we brought some boons farm.

Yeah but to sip.

Sure we're not going to be drinking.

To savor the taste.

All right here we go.

Right.

Oh.

Oh he's turning around in a circle.

He's not looking at you.

Nope.

And now he's going to turn again.

And now he's looking at Kevin.

Wow.

And now he's turning him.

He's going to get dizzy.

Look at it.

Ryan.

Ryan gave his right way.

Last one.

Oh nobody.

Nobody.

He's not looking at nobody.

Well I will play again later.

Well play again later.

I want to feel that feeling.

I do too.

I want to feel that feeling.

I'm not going to lie I'm mad that he didn't look at me.

I know.

I'm furious.

I'm furious at you too.

I don't blame you.

Where are we?

Oh yeah.

We're doing the top 10.

We're going to the top 10.

Here we go.

Let's get to it.

This is your episode 10.

Number 10.

Oh right.

Episode 10.

And you can be said about this episode.

Well I'll tell you one thing.

It is episode number 625.

And it is very recent.

It is from October 28.

So it's out of that curious clump.

But just a couple months later.

Just a couple months later.

And this is an episode called Petite Modeling.

Which probably does not tell you what it should.

I will say we've had conversations about the titles of the episodes over the years.

And my theory was that certain episodes were not being voted for because people could not tell what they were from the title and the performers.

Yes.

So this year I have been working with July who does all of our descriptions or at least most of them and a great guy.

And we've been trying July summer.

It's a curious clump.

Yes.

He played one of the clumps.

The most curious.

He played mama.

You know Hercules Hercules Hercules Hercules Hercules.

We worked this year to try to make the titles a little more descriptive of what people would remember from the episodes.

So for instance the Chastman family.

It probably in the past we titled the episodes based on something someone said like a bit of dialogue or something.

It's fun.

Which we did on Mr. Show.

We did on Mr. Show.

The episode titles would come from a line of dialogue.

Yes.

From a line of dialogue.

But this for instance on the previous episode Bean Dip and Randy Snut's return that's what I said.

I believe the title originally was just that's what I said because that's what Tim says over and over but we adjusted it to say Bean Dip and Randy Snut's return so people would know what it was.

Also we put the descriptions on the poll this year which was very helpful I think.

I bet it was.

So but this one petite modeling when I say the title at this point I'd stop caring about it.

And was not adjusting the titles.

But this one it's called petite modeling I believe because of the one of the guests Claudia O'Dorney who Claudia is a great comedian from Australia.

Who is very fun and she plays herself on the show but she plays sort of an alternate version of herself where every episode she comes on she essentially she started coming on comedy bang bang saying she'd won a contest to be on and the more you dig into it the more you find it's just her mother trying to get her out of the house.

She's trying to get her sending her to the US ostensibly saying Claudia won a contest just to get her out of Australia so she can be alone.

Which if that was happening in real life that's sad.

That's a sad thing but here on the show it's funny.

I can't think.

It's funny.

Here's what I like about comedy is that regular it's like it takes things that are sad but then the thing that makes them funny is that they are so sad.

Here's my equation comedy equals tragedy.

The end.

Yes.

So on this episode Claudia previous to the clip you're going to hear Claudia came on talking about how she was on a go see which is a modeling term.

Oh she came on here talking about this.

And we talked about how she has become a petite model her mother got her into the petite modeling industry.

This also has John Gabris on the episode who plays Intern Geno.

Oh he did play Geno on this one?

And we're not really going to be hearing from John that much.

Whenever Geno.

That can't be true.

Whenever John is on the show playing Geno usually we start with him as Geno and he tells a little bit about his life.

We're not going to be hearing that in the clip because also Ben Rogers was on this show a really funny guy but he won't be in the clip because he's he introduced his character has not been introduced yet.

I get it now.

This episode was voted for I believe because of Will Hines.

Now Will Hines has been on the show for two years now three years a great addition to the roster.

So funny one of my favorite people to do the show with always just a master improviser has literally written a book about improvising that you can read.

Great guy as well personally and so fun to do the show with him and I just wanted to highlight him because I think a lot of times he I don't know what it is his episodes aren't flashy maybe or something he's just like so solid and funny in them that a lot of times we don't talk about him in the best ofs but this episode certainly was voted for because of what he does in this episode.

Now what happens in this episode?

No hold on a second.

Yeah.

How do you know this?

I just never talked about this before but now all of a sudden this year you're saying here's why I think people voted for this.

I've talked to I mean I've talked about it a little bit before.

I don't know about this.

This is something's up with you.

I have been going to the Midwest going to diners and talking to swing voters about why they voted for their episode.

So you're talking to real listeners?

Yeah real listeners.

The real listeners in the heart of this great country.

Yes.

And you're like when are you going to stop listening to the show?

I don't know I just like it.

I mean yeah it's not maybe the host doesn't act in a way that I think is all that great but they don't know they don't really do the host.

Yes.

Questions.

I find that weird when people say I've been listening to the show for three years I just saw a picture of you and you're not what I imagined you to be.

Google is out there just look up a picture of if you were ever listening to a podcast and maybe there are people like this.

If you're ever listening to a podcast wouldn't you look up a picture of the person you've been listening to?

You know I've I thought that too but then I realized I don't always do that.

Yeah I guess so.

I don't always do that.

It just sometimes takes me a while to look up the person.

I mean when I was a kid and you would listen to radio DJs I would always imagine they were the coolest guys in the world like they'd be wearing like a leather jacket and sunglasses.

Radio DJs absolutely disappointing looking at you.

You can look them up there always these gross slobs.

Yeah.

I think Kevin and me those guys here at the world famous.

K-rock here in Los Angeles those are just like normal guys.

But usually or striker.

But I had the same thing.

But I was a kid striker.

He's a k-rock DJ.

He's like one of those like kind of orange county guys who actually is like a good looking guy I think.

Yeah that's what I.

I like.

I prefer.

Oh shadow very handsome.

Father of.

Actress from 21 Jump Street.

I believe.

Alright Amber Stevens I believe.

Okay.

But I prefer it when they look.

When they are the slobs though because then you see like these good looking DJs near like they're the snobs.

Yeah they're the snobs.

It's got to be slobs versus snobs.

I'd rather be with the slobs and the slobs.

Exactly.

I know that's going to surprise people because I dress like a snob.

But I'm a slob.

At heart.

At heart and in practice.

Yeah I'm disgusting.

Why were we talking about DJs?

Oh with their voices.

I don't know.

Because people don't know what you look like.

Oh people don't know what I look like.

Yeah anyway.

Well Heinz is hilarious.

Look me up.

Will Heinz is great.

He here's what happened.

He he usually I would say he comes on the show with an idea.

Will definitely comes on with an idea every time.

We played the Chastman family on our last episode where you guys had no more than the idea of you were a family.

And you were going to find it in the moment.

No.

Will.

We almost did.

Will comes on with an idea.

But he is such a master improviser that he is willing to go wherever the idea takes him.

Or wherever somebody else forces it.

Some of the enforcers it.

So I remember a previous episode where he was talking about how he was I think a motor cyclist and he casually threw out that he does it on land and see and we wondered why he did it on sea which let him down a huge rabbit hole of going on cruise ships and riding a motorcycle around him.

And that became the primary focus of his episode.

Something similar happens here right off the top of the episode and we never got to his idea.

So he can still use another time.

He came back as this character on the holiday episode last week and I was talking to him and he's he he loves doing this character now because we never get to his actual thing.

So he came on as a physical therapist which we never got to.

So and this is a very enjoyable clip.

Let's hear it.

This is your number 10.

Number 10.

Please welcome to the show Stanley Chamberlain.

Hello so nice to be here.

Thank you Scott.

Very nice to meet you.

This is Claudia.

She she won a contest but not a contest to be on this show as she has previous.

Oh here's some water coming.

Oh gosh.

Thank you.

Do you know our intern?

Thank you.

Are you really doing it?

Are you a medical doctor?

I'm a physical therapist.

I'm fully trained.

So you went to medical school.

That's right.

I went to I went twice.

You went twice?

Yes.

Meaning two days?

You liked it so much.

I went through it twice.

I went through Johns Hopkins initially and it was hard.

So I went again through Southern Connecticut State University just to crush.

Oh okay.

So wait you went through it once and graduated but then you wanted to do it and have a better time?

Yep.

I wanted to I like doing things once I know what's coming.

I'd like to ask a question.

Then I would recognize that question and you can.

And you know it's coming.

Okay.

Why is his name Johns?

Oh I think it was just more than one.

Is it like Ruth's Chris?

No I think it's like a turniest general.

I think it was this more than one John whose last names were Hopkins.

So it's much like Whopper's Jr. where you pluralize the first word rather than Hopkins is the modifier of the multiple Johns.

Got it.

Is that the most boring answer I could have?

Did it come up in your classes?

Is that something?

Every year at the initiation they would go over the naming scheme and what Johns Hopkins meant they would correct people if they did Johns.

Who this talk us to this medical school initiation?

Yes.

It was initiation.

That sounds intense.

I mean just the initiation of John's documentation by a little.

No it's not an orientation it's an initiation they bring you below ground.

Aha scary.

I told you.

They blindfold you.

This is what I wanted to do over at a different university.

Okay.

I don't worry.

They blindfold you and everyone's acting and you start to ask questions you're like what's this about and they're like shut up shut up you don't be dumb don't be dumb.

There's a lot of pressure to not look dumb at Johns Hopkins.

Oh I bet yeah.

And because it's incredibly competitive medicals.

Oh of course anyone who looks dumb.

Yeah.

Great lacrosse program too.

And so you go underground your blindfold and you take all your clothes off you feel this getting beaten by what you assume are Oakley.

You take off the clothes.

They don't take off your clothes.

They don't strip you.

No you have to do it.

You comply.

You have to comply.

I think it's.

No one's pants.

You have to take your underpants off.

Dongs out.

And you're being beaten with why do you assume they're Oakley's to me it felt like Oakley's.

No I thought you said Oakley's.

Like this on your mother's.

Oh that's what I thought you said.

What did you say Oak leaves?

Oh oh yeah.

Yeah.

You know what two things that I could have said whatever the most boring one is the one that I sent.

I.

Oh leaves.

Did that.

Yeah do that.

I mean what would hurt more Oakley's I feel like what hurt more they're hard plastic.

You can't hit with those croquies you know those things that hold them on if you're jet skiing those things fucking hurt.

Is that no right.

So you're down there and you don't know what's going on.

You're 18 in my or 21 years old and you're terrified and you don't want to look stupid.

You're like your imposter syndrome is big.

So off come the clothes.

Off come the clothes.

You don't want to not fit in.

You don't assume that this will make sense and you would rather people look at your tiny tiny penis.

That's right.

Which I seem stupid.

Yes which I do have.

Oh shoot I forgot I have that on my name tag.

Tiny tiny penis.

I'm so worried about the size of a penis that I just like to get it out there.

Yeah I thought I wondered you know what the Arklight were on their name tag is their favorite movie.

I wonder why you had tiny tiny penis under your name.

Well as I'm looking you have to have your favorite organ.

Oh much like Arklight.

And yours is tiny tiny penis.

Yes I like tiny tiny tiny.

Did you have to describe it thusly or.

Well I don't like large penises nor do I like unremarkably sized one.

Oh so this is your favorite organ on anyone.

That's right but you happen to have it.

Which is how I like.

Lucky.

There I am underground.

It's an indication.

It's an initiation.

Wow I'm hooked.

So there I am.

I'm underground.

There's a bub there's a babbling brook somewhere.

We're deep underground.

I'm sorry.

You know how you can tell I just have one more question.

Sure.

What's are your balls normal sized or do they make my balls are normal size.

So that makes the normal size for a tiny tiny penis.

No normal size for a regular penis big relative to my tiny tiny tiny penis.

Which makes them look even smaller.

Forrest perspective.

Yeah yeah.

It's like given by part of the petite modeling.

Yes right.

I sort of like I have a petite penis with regular size testicles.

So there I am.

There's a babbling brook and so we've know we've walked very deep.

Because it's like we're not just in a room or a basement.

We've got there's earth.

So is it cold or hot.

Cold.

Okay so you haven't gotten towards the center of the earth.

You haven't gotten that far yet.

But then did you ever get that?

Yeah yes.

We enter into an elevator.

And they bring us down several miles.

Wow.

We come out into now I never saw this but it felt like I was near a something very warm I assume magma.

The core.

The core could be.

The center of the earth.

Yeah.

And still I'm worried about you know I'm like we start I hear people asking questions.

Are you hearing like a rustling of creatures that are down there with some sort of like there's some underground language.

It was a society of work a worker race.

You knew it was a society.

Well I can hear them having exchanging protocols.

So you knew there were laws and repercussions for breaking the law.

I heard a trial.

One of the worker races must have like somehow insulted another member of the worker race.

And an impromptu trial.

They spoke sort of a broken English.

Oh okay so it's salt me and salt me you did.

How can you miss?

No it's fair.

On fear.

Wow okay.

What's going on.

Do they learn the language did they ever talk about this.

Do they learn the language from the top of the earth.

I'm assuming they either learned it from us or there's a common source that taught both of us.

Okay interesting yeah.

Jesus.

Could be Jesus.

Could be.

I didn't rule him out.

They never mentioned Jesus.

He did not come up.

He didn't come up.

I mean I had the blindfold on I didn't interact with the world.

Now you don't know did they have religion or was maybe down there by the center of the earth religion isn't isn't even a thing.

They did have religion.

They're Presbyterian.

Oh they are.

Isn't that interesting.

That is interesting.

Do they have doors.

I heard a door.

Okay.

So you heard a door.

I heard a door open elevator door.

This is your first day of medical school.

First day of Johns Hopkins.

You're doing one.

I got dropped off by my dad because I was too scared to go on my own when I was 21 years old.

You dad moved you in the grad school.

My dad moved me in the grad school.

So you didn't need a ride.

That's cute.

You could have driven yourself.

I could have driven myself but it was like you know he dropped me off at college.

I was like hang your posters and stuff.

Yeah I put up like my my reservoir talking.

I was like I'm going to go to the gym.

I'm going to go to the gym.

You hang your posters and stuff.

I put up my my reservoir talking poster.

What about your fair faucet?

I had a like a Jimmy Hendrix.

Oh that's cool.

He's playing in the post.

You have the poster.

The black light poster.

Was that the Jimmy Hendrix one?

Yeah.

And I also had a kiss army.

Oh okay.

With the spirit of 76 one where they're all dressed up like confederate.

This is their in central park and they're using their superpowers to like save people.

Oh I got it.

That's right.

Anyway.

But now but you're nowhere near there at this point.

No where near that like that was.

Those are your touchstones.

That's what way from my comfort zone.

Your dad's gone.

My dad's gone.

Long gone.

You're you're.

But then totally away from your home.

But yes.

Yes.

Thank you for appreciating this.

It was it was so disorient.

Honestly being naked was the least of my worst.

Sure.

Yeah.

I know you may be left there.

Yeah.

Is this is this is.

Are you part of this new society that's oral?

Do I have to join the worker race however age it is?

Does the worker race have clothes?

They definitely had clothes because I heard them arguing about pleats.

Oh that makes sense.

I know that had khakis.

No that just came up.

They're like they're like you're going to wear that to be a lawyer and he's like I can wear what I want.

I'm a lawyer.

Okay.

There's like it's pleated.

That's out of fashion.

He's like shut up.

I know what I'm doing.

These are just happening right there.

They seem to be walking along beside me.

Okay.

So this is some sort of like walk and talk like a sort.

It's really hard to picture.

Yeah.

Looks like I think you're doing a great job.

I can really visualize it.

I keep imagining it's hot but it's cold.

I've been trying.

No it's hot at this point.

Now it's hot.

Okay right.

I'm trying to draw it but I'm still stuck on your penis.

This is all I have so far.

You just let me paint a piece.

Yeah.

Okay well that's that's pretty close.

If many attempts I see.

Yeah.

The vein format works for you.

There's too many veins.

Okay.

So this is a Thanksgiving thing where you've done the outline of your palm.

Yes because I'm going to choose one of these five depending on the size.

I would do a pinky for a pinky.

Yeah okay.

I just add some like apple sized balls right there.

Oh you got it.

So what happened?

Apple sized balls.

Boots with the fur.

She hit the flow.

We're hitting that bolo baby.

Oh yeah.

This is a reference I don't know.

So now what happens?

What happens?

You're naked.

So there we are.

So you get lead into a chamber and the doors thunder shut behind.

And they take off the blindfolds.

Okay.

Around me are all the same people I entered with.

The incoming class of Johns Hopkins.

Okay.

Has anyone dropped off at this point?

I can't.

It was roughly the same size.

Maybe.

You don't know the other people so you don't know.

I'm not filling with them.

They look like an assistant.

I think in the future if you're going to do a radio show or a podcast.

I would introduce myself as something besides a physical therapist.

This is fucking super interesting.

This is not what I came into talking about.

No we'll get to what you want to talk about.

I'm just saying this is fucking wild.

This is a documentary made about you.

This is incidental.

This is a side story.

I tried to tell people about this and they're like we don't care.

Get back to physical therapy.

I really care about it.

I love it.

I've been wanting to talk about this for years.

Okay.

Yeah.

Please spare us no detail.

So there's the Dean.

Okay.

The Dean of Johns Hopkins.

The Dean of the Workers Union.

No.

The Dean of John the Worker Race.

Worker Race.

I have to have Deans.

Okay.

So maybe they have a provost sort of situation.

Okay.

So you didn't know what to call them.

It's your first day.

Well this I don't know what his name is.

And you still don't know.

I still don't know because he's got to introduce himself.

It might be Dean.

It could be Dean.

It could be.

It could be Dean Jesus.

It's not eliminated.

Yeah we have no idea at this point.

He's grown antlers.

He has grown antlers.

He hasn't put them on or he's fakes them.

Maybe there's some really intricate.

Special effects.

Fristhetics.

Kind of some sort of situation.

It's a movie makeup.

It looked real and his face was beet red and he was naked with a face.

And he was naked with and there was all kinds of insignias drawn on it.

Oh yeah.

Pentagram rooms.

Yeah it might have been a pentagram.

It was sort of like an illustrated man situation where he was just decked out.

Wow.

Still head on his glasses.

Oh okay.

That's one thing that you can never really go without.

You can't get away with it.

As scary as you are.

If you have bad eyes you have bad eyes.

You got to be able to see it.

I want to see one of those movies like Halloween or something and Mike Myers is like wearing glasses.

Because you know every serial killer in these movies has great eyesight.

And they never go to the bathroom.

In H2O he gets lazy.

As long as they shoot a laser at him thinking they're going to kill him and then he's like he's like now I can see it perfectly.

You talk and he's like I always have bitch.

That movie he's answered and created a lot of questions.

Scary is fun.

Yeah everyone still pissed at Rob Zombie for that show.

Yeah I liked it.

So now he addresses us as the Fallen.

We're like what?

He can't mean us.

We haven't done anything.

Where?

From where have you fallen?

Yeah you got me.

From grace from our humanity.

You're in a press to just welcome the Fallen.

We're in some sort of cement room deep in the earth.

Wow.

Then he just starts going over academic prerequisites as if none of this has happened.

He's like you're going to need four credits of anatomy.

You're going to need four credits of biology.

You still have to do it?

That's it.

Well they're hard.

It's the John's Hopkins.

It's four credits of tough biology.

Yeah yeah four credits.

One credit of John's Hopkins biology is like six credits somewhere.

Oh I've been in National Community College for nine years so I get it.

Okay yeah.

If you're a fellow academic then you understand.

So you have a fairly comprehensive sense of biology then.

Yeah we went way over biology then anatomy.

So you know a lot about it.

But it's the fundamentals.

I know everything about it.

Anything you can ask me about it.

What is the human body's largest organ?

The skin.

Okay there you go.

He knows it all.

Sorry boring to be right.

My ego took over.

Boring to be correct on the trivia question.

I understand.

That's how I went.

Where was I?

You were well.

Oh yeah.

We're deep in a cement chamber.

And he's beneath the earth and it's warm.

Beneath the earth.

Oh yes deep in the earth.

And he's going over and then he's saying if you want to change roommates you can't you have to go to this particular office.

And it's all just very dry information.

Do you even know who your roommates are at this point?

No we haven't been given a...

I mean I went to my room but I haven't met the guy.

Nothing's been a sign.

We don't know anything.

It's reasonable that he'd tell you that.

I guess that's the kind of information.

Did he tell you where the cafeteria was?

No.

Really?

That's...yeah.

Then he says okay and he goes over some other information and passes out some forms we have to fill out.

We have to fill out a sexual harassment form.

Did you have to fill it out right then and there?

Naked?

Naked.

On my knees.

I put the paper on my knees and with...

I don't tell boys about whether or not you want it to be sexually harassed.

Yes you had to put in yes or no.

Yeah an option.

Did he pass out?

I said no.

Sure.

I would have been fucked because I always just clicked accept accept accept accept accept.

So I would have been...

You would have been in a deep trouble.

Yeah you would have been very Harris.

Did he pass out pens?

No.

Did everyone bring them?

No.

One of the worker...

I did see one of the worker races.

One of the worker race came by with a knife.

Picked our pinky fingers and needed to drip blood onto the forms to answer it.

Okay.

So what are the worker race?

Which is actually easier to do.

What's that?

What do the worker race look like?

Rabbits.

They look like rabbits.

What's that?

They look like rabbits.

Tumbness looking things?

No.

Tumbness is more of a sader.

Traditionally a half man half goat.

Okay right.

Yeah.

I believe a rabbit is that's called Harvey or...

Sure.

That's full rabbit.

Yeah.

They were like...

You never go full rabbit.

Three and a half feet tall.

Walking.

Instead of hopping they were sort of comfortably walking on their hind legs.

So they're walking on two legs not on four.

Two.

By pedal.

If you go.

To walk up four legs would break the laws.

Is that right?

Down there yes.

And for legs you would be jailed.

Right.

How'd you know that Scott?

Well I've heard stories of this episode.

What the hell Scott?

I mean I walk on two legs all the time.

You were asking him questions as if he didn't know what he was talking about and now you suddenly know.

Well I would assume for a race like that to walk on four legs would be some sort of...

It would be against the law.

Sounds like maybe you've gone down there.

I mean I've not been down that far certainly.

What's the fact that you've gone?

I mean it was... you know I mean maybe a few kilometers.

Wait you don't always walk on your two legs.

One time I was at your house sitting in the living room and you came down the stairs upside down in a back bed.

I did.

You got unrelated.

That's due to an exorcist type thing.

Oh okay.

I knew that.

Yeah it's a totally different thing.

Continue with your story.

So what happened?

Well then it gets weird.

Then it gets weird.

Yes because so after we get all this information and we're properly initiated he's like alright.

Now as you know you've entered into an extremely competitive program and not all of you are going to complete and graduate.

Did you do the look to your left look to your right one of you?

I was waiting for that and he didn't do it.

That's a classic.

I know.

Did he do bottle of red bottle of white?

He did.

He first sang all of scenes from an Italian restaurant.

All of it.

That's a seven minute long song.

Thank God it's good.

Yeah that's true.

And he was good singing it.

He was great.

Wow.

He actually didn't have such a strong voice as much as he committed.

Okay that's all you got it.

Which I feel like is all you want.

Any backing track?

It's pretty much the same for Billy.

No no backing track was acapella.

That's a tough song to do acapella.

But especially the bonnet on time.

Oh he hummed all that.

He hummed it.

He hummed like the clarinet solo too.

Was he imitating different instruments?

Can I just say that it's so interesting to me that there are follow up questions of this part of the story.

How he sang.

See he's driven Italian restaurant.

I don't mind doing it.

I've always wanted to say this part of the story but I've never gone down.

There we are in front of a stag elemental.

Sure.

But okay yes.

What was your question?

He did all the different instruments.

He imitated the instruments.

No not all of them but he would do the prominent ones.

So that's the clarinet.

But then when he goes bah dah dah dah dah dah.

Was he doing the piano or was he doing the horn section?

Initially he would do that bah bah bah bah.

He's strung around doing these like lung drums.

He's strunging.

He's in doing.

And it was a relief because things had been so alien and strange that to hear a familiar song was calming.

Sure yeah.

And I was like maybe this guy's not so bad.

Okay.

Maybe this is going to be actually fine.

Yeah.

Okay.

But then it got weird.

Then it got weird.

He said you know you're entering a competitive program.

And if you are a weak character, if you are a minimal talent you will not be able to survive.

You must fight your way back to the surface.

Fight your way back to the surface.

Handed each of us a machete.

A machete.

Fuck yeah.

Whoa.

This owns.

And then he said the elevator that returns to the surface is powered by these gems.

And the gems will only work once.

Okay.

And there's only 10 of them.

And there were 20 of you?

About 60 of us.

60.

Oh gosh.

So 50 did not make it out.

That's right.

Whoa.

Incredible.

And you're one of the 10.

Yeah.

And then after you graduated you're like I should probably go to medical school.

I would go to another medical school again because I don't want it to be like this.

Right.

So I went to Southern Connecticut State University the second time.

So did you take out five guys or do you know G.E.D. in the restaurant?

Or Uber Ease.

I took out five guys.

I ordered from five guys.

They had a telephone service down there.

Five guys delivered.

Okay.

We all talked to each other.

It took a long time to deliver.

We were like five delivery guys.

Five guys delivered.

They already had gyms.

I guess the guys had their own gems.

So they couldn't go up and down.

I mean they're delivering a little time.

Well we all were like we're about to murder each other.

Let's have a last meal.

Oh really?

So you guys paused.

We were like let's be civil and have a last meal together.

There's a gentleman's agreement of like love.

Yes.

This is coming.

Death is coming to five sixth of us.

Yes.

So we ordered five guys and we all wrote letters to our loved ones that we agreed that whoever survived would deliver them.

Did you keep that promise?

I did and that's why I'm here today.

What?

Again I would say put that in your bio when you come on.

No I'm still talking about physical therapy.

Wait to whom are you delivering this letter?

One of us?

Claudia.

What?

That's right.

Wait who died?

I murdered a fellow contest winner.

But not my family member.

No.

Oh okay fine.

Well they seem very, they you meant a lot to them.

There's a person in their letter to you and you don't know who they are.

This guy's name was Chet.

He said he wanted a contest with you some time ago.

His last name was a tournament.

Wellman.

Chet.

Wellman.

Yeah.

Well here's this letter.

He said you have to promise to get this to Claudia Doherty.

Whoa okay.

So I'm giving this to you.

Can you read it out my eyes?

I can see your eyes look very sore.

Yeah.

Dear Claudia it's me Chet.

That's right.

Acorn Chet.

I don't know when to put that even.

Whoa.

Who is what?

Do you know Chet?

I do it.

And then you know what Acorn Chet is referring to.

That's a private thing.

That's right.

It's actually kind of an aggressive thing for him to call me.

Oh oh it is.

Wait he called himself Acorn Chet.

The reference that is kind of aggressive.

Oh okay this has very Chet.

He seemed very aggro.

If it makes you feel any better he was the first to go.

So he's aggro but he's still all of that was like Chet.

He had like a lot of like Chet.

Just like oh man.

All that was a good triangle.

He killed you guys inside.

Shit.

And then you just slop.

Yep little tiny dicks me slitched him right off.

Because my small dick never thought that I would be unmanly but I was actually quite handy.

Plus also you got your equipment tight.

You know you don't have any hangers for people to chop off.

That's right I'm not as vulnerable.

Small dick is actually the highest form of evolution.

Yeah because all the big dicks they would get like whacked with the machetes and then they're in my dick and then they're looking down.

My dick and then they're distracted.

Everyone's so concerned about losing their dick in the machete battle but you you have no concern.

You're not even flopping around.

You're not even risking anything.

I don't even have apple sized.

It's all those balls.

I don't know.

How did you women got out?

The women all survived.

Okay good.

But they joined the worker race.

Oh they survived by bargaining their way to entering the worker race.

Well I would have had typical chicks.

Yeah I would imagine the worker race needs more to you know to be more productive.

They need more children more.

They have to breathe.

That was the plan.

I didn't stick around long enough to find out.

So you never went down there again?

No.

I understand that.

Like rabbits.

Yeah I got that.

Could you finish the letter because it looks lengthy.

Yeah it is.

It's a lot.

Dear Claudia to me Chet.

Now this is an insane coincidence.

Let's just talk for a second.

This is an insane coincidence that you came on.

No I didn't even know I would be here.

Maybe your mother this is why she's sitting here today.

Seems like it could be do you know my like do you know my mother.

Do you know my mother?

Not well.

To quote that wonderful children's book.

Oh I guess it's are you my mother.

I do my mother.

Yeah.

Are you my mother?

I'm not your mother.

That should be the sequel.

Do you know my mother?

What about the other?

I'm down in stakes.

Are you my mother?

I get you're not my mother.

And then the third one should be him.

Have you heard of my mother?

Each one is more removed.

Does anyone have a mother?

I'm sorry.

Okay.

I want to let you.

The plot is really thickening.

It truly is as thick as the pages on this letter because this is seven pages wrapping up.

That's eight point Ariel font.

It's so much.

Very small.

So Che here is like it's a dear Claudia it's me Chet.

Acorn Chet.

Here in my last moments I find my thoughts traveling back to that day we spent together.

Only one day.

Yeah.

Thank you guys some more water.

Great.

Yeah you're going to need it because this is a long long.

I was this wasn't happening on a podcast.

Dear Claudia it's me Chet.

Okay you have to go backwards.

It's good for me though because I'm getting a lot.

I'm because I keep missing the first couple.

It refreshes the memory.

Here at my last moments I find my thoughts going back to that day we spent together.

When we won that contest to run that radio station I guess you want to contest a runner radio station.

Yes we did.

And you and I were code DJs for two and a half hours.

Code DJ can you just say they're both DJs you don't need to like split up the duties of a DJ.

I mean I have some respect for the DJ team like you know Flipper and the bird you know like they don't call themselves code DJs do they.

Well since they had probably both met that day and won a contest.

We would just like show whatever you know.

So you have to share a chair it's co.

Oh okay that's true.

The conversation we had changed my life and I never have felt as strongly connected to someone as I did to you that day.

Oh God.

And the friendship I felt with you was reassuring to me that human empathy is possible.

And I've thought of you every day and longed only to meet you again and now that I see that my life may be ending I wanted you to know that it is you I'm thinking of and then it's just the first chapter of great expectations.

The whole first chapter.

Yeah so can I have that I need a calendar.

Yeah what does it call me no that's a Moby Dick.

What is the first line of great expectations?

Because the best times it was the worst at times.

No two cities.

Yeah okay.

Some of the two cities is the title of a real book.

Yeah why did you what did you think it was because I've been reading this magazine called Tale of Two Titties and I didn't realize it was a magazine.

It's a period I've been trying to get through it it's dense.

How is tail spilled?

A T-A-I-L.

Right.

Yeah.

Let me see the letter all okay yeah yeah so it goes on my father's family name being perip and my Christian name Philip my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than PIP so I called myself PIP and came to be called PIP and it goes on.

Yeah.

Okay yeah.

I'm out of here.

Wow.

Yeah.

Well it sounds like he was just stalling from getting machete to death.

And Claudia.

And he did.

He was like a copy of great expectations.

Yeah he was copying it down he was copying it down.

He got it.

Pretending that he was the letter.

I thought he did.

All that's done.

Give me one more second.

Claudia all that well and he was just like trying to stall.

Well yeah we really only knew each other for that one afternoon.

We were on.

I'm glad to hear that because I murdered this man.

I murdered this man.

You killed one guy or several.

I shouldn't say.

Oh yeah.

But go ahead though.

I killed seven people.

Seven people.

So someone else only killed three.

That's right.

Wow.

Or one person killed.

Did it change your personality afterwards?

No.

How do you know though?

Well yeah because I don't know what I would have been.

Yeah.

Do you feel a change once you took the life from someone?

I certainly was not.

I wasn't.

A certain fear left me.

To see the light go out in someone's eyes and realize that their soul is no longer inhabiting this earth.

That must prepare you for the medical profession.

I think so.

And when we took our Hippocratic oath they have a different version of Johns Hopkins which is like carry on the legacy of those you murdered by helping others.

By helping.

That's what brings you here today.

Wow.

To give me that letter.

That's right.

I've delivered the other six letters.

Nope.

I'm keeping an eye out for them just to show up on podcasts.

I've been going to open mics hoping they get into comedy and to seeing if they start doing that.

Okay there are better ways to find these people than going back to scanning the show listing page at UCB to see if any of them are on Herald night.

Okay yeah it's gonna take you a while.

Number two.

There we go.

You know what Scott?

You promised that it was going to be very enjoyable and you did not lie.

I did not disappoint and neither did Will Hines.

That was kept.

That was great.

I just love the idea that in the spur of the moment after saying initiation rather than orientation he was able to come up with all that detail.

Yeah.

It's really wonderful.

So Will here's looking at you kid.

Our tribute to Will Hines.

It's a shame.

We can't do jokes like that anymore because they've come true.

Hey no.

But with the elderly.

All right.

Let's go to a break.

When we come back we're getting into single digits.

Single digits.

All right we'll be right back with more comedy bag bag.

Comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang.

Hey that's the new theme song.

Hey is it?

Nope.

Oh too bad.

So sad.

I really got excited.

Take it away from me.

There we go.

All right let's play the snowman game.

He's spinning around and he has landed on.

Oh so close.

He's splitting the dips of Kevin and Paul.

If someone had walked in the door that would have been amazing if like nobody like Lenny and squeaky came in and said hello.

I mean the more people you have the more exciting.

No just over your shoulder.

Boulder holder.

Come on look at me.

Look at me.

No.

Wow.

All right we'll get maybe on the last episode.

Yeah maybe.

He'll look at one of us.

Well this is this episode not the last episode so let's get to it.

Let's crack the single digits.

This is your episode nine.

Number nine.

All right this is episode number 592 from March 18th.

This was a.

Not quite in the curious.

Nope but just two weeks after the werewolf with all episode and this is an episode called the P Newers.

Oh I know all about this.

The P Newers.

Yes.

All right let me set the scene a little bit.

The participants involved are Langston Kerman.

This was his first time on the show.

Now Langston Langston's a great comedian and an actor.

He's on Insecure.

And I got to know him because we wrote on.

Did I get to know him on the Oscars?

I feel like or did I get to know him before?

I don't know.

I don't remember but we did work on the Oscars together.

And God now I'm forgetting.

I'm sure we talk about it in this episode.

So I'm talking to myself Paul.

What do you think I'm doing?

You're talking to yourself?

Yes.

Just now.

Great.

We should talk to each other.

Why does Paul do this?

But Langston's great.

Langston's really funny and I want to have him back more often because this is such a good episode.

I was listening to this clip the other day and he's a natural fit for comedy bang bang.

An inquisitive guy who asks all the right questions.

Yes.

Follow the money.

We also have Ego Wodom.

That's right.

Ego is currently an SNL cast member, featured cast member and she's very funny and she's been on the show for a couple of years now and actually toured around with us this summer as well.

Yes.

It was so much fun.

She's hilarious and great to hang out with and very nice.

She on a previous episode last year I believe she came on as a character called Entre P.

Newer.

And we have a lot of entrepreneurs on this show.

It's kind of a running joke because a lot of characters come in with a bad idea of a business and she came in literally as a character called Entre P. Newer who was pitching ideas that already existed.

Yes.

All of her inventions are basically things that she doesn't know the names of.

Right.

And I guess she doesn't know exists already.

She does.

Yeah.

But we talk about it at the beginning of this clip.

But on that previous episode I believe it ended with us riffing around and joking that she had a brother called Appetizer P. Newer because her name is Entre P. Newer.

And so we were like, okay, next time you come on, let's bring your brother.

And she likes to work with, as previously mentioned, he was on playing OJ on our last episode, Carl Tartt.

Yes.

They're good friends.

And they've worked together a lot.

And so Carl was a natural fit to do this with her.

And this was just pure fun.

I enjoy doing episodes like this because you from start to finish, I love talking to Langston.

And then these guys are so hilarious and just like a fun hour and 15 minutes that never lags and is just so fun.

And so we're going to hear a little bit first from Entre and then Appetizer comes in.

This here, this is your number nine.

Number nine.

Entre, last time you were on the show, the ninth anniversary show, as I recall, you pitched a lot of businesses to us.

I remember one of them was a like a rectangular motorized propulsion vehicle.

Sure.

Several, two to even seven people could ride in one of them.

Right.

And there would be the oldest invention in the world, the wheel.

Yes.

And then he came and banged out with his bone.

Right.

There would be approximately four of those on the belly.

On the belly.

Yeah.

On the belly.

Undercarriage.

On the taint of the car.

On the gooch meat of the car.

And then we all realized you were just pitching car.

And in fact, you called it a car just now so you know what a car is.

Never heard of it.

I don't have a name for it just yet.

I've heard.

I've told you.

I've called it a car.

I don't have a name for it just yet.

But when I was describing it to some colleagues, they had used the word cause.

So I thought that's not a bad name.

It's a shirt and sweet to the point.

It's not a bad name.

I would say most of those three letter words are already taken.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

Like find any combination of three words.

It usually means something already.

It's true.

Pat's box.

A bat.

A bat?

I mean, all these can.

Can't.

They're all great words and they're things that we use all the time.

They're taken.

And they're all taken.

They're all taken.

So if you're out there trying to come up with a new invention, it's like what do you got?

Right.

Well, I do want to talk to you about something I have also come up with because I'm interested in investors.

And if you are interested in investing, I am an investor is so rich that he doesn't even know if he joined the WGI.

It's meaningless to me.

Yes.

Those dudes who cares.

Let me check.

Forget about it immediately.

Disgusting.

Listen, this is this now this hear me out on this one.

I'm always it.

We're all here.

We're all very excited.

What's a cubicle a cubicle type building?

A cube meaning equal on all sides, all eight sides or is it six sides?

I guess it would be six.

Six sides.

A cubicle.

Six sides.

Yes, that's the food Jesus.

Three times a cubicle type building where if you're not feeling well, you can go.

There will be people there who can assist you in regaining health, determine what it is that's wrong with you.

And then give you the proper kind of treatment that you would need to be healthy again.

Okay, I'm going to stop you really briefly.

Now, hear me out.

I'm not going to stop you.

Okay, go ahead.

Scorn and stop me.

White man's played me.

No, white man's playing at all.

I'm merely.

I know the fans love when I talk about race.

I'm just I'm person-splaining.

Okay.

Just two people talking.

Just let me person-splaining to you that everything you've described other than the cubicle nature of the building, which most buildings are not purely cubicle.

They're interesting.

Sometimes they're more what you would call a three-dimensional rectangle.

But it sounds to me as if you're describing a hospital.

I don't, what is that?

I haven't heard that.

It's a building normally not cubicle.

Okay.

I just need an aromas.

Okay.

Could be an aromas.

Mm-hmm.

How'd that look?

Ah, thank you for asking.

It's sort of like what you were describing, but at an angle.

Okay.

A little tilted.

But more, I think the more important part is that it's almost identical to what you describe of a space where people go to get healthcare.

Right.

Okay.

Yeah, the shape of the building normally doesn't matter.

Although I would say the bottom usually has to be flat.

Flat.

Yeah.

Usually so.

The thing I want to do certainly has a flat bottom.

Yeah.

I would say it has a flat bottom.

And that's not thick.

No, no, no.

It's not thick.

It's unfortunate.

No, it's unfortunate.

The bottom, yeah, the bottom of what I'm doing is unfortunate.

Most buildings, they have a bottom side too.

So you're not falling to the center of the earth.

And the building is going to have a slim waist.

Right.

Big titties.

That's a big piece.

It's going to be a thick building.

Don't understand.

It's going to have to contain a lot of people.

Okay.

Because people are falling left and right.

Right.

Yeah, they are.

Yeah.

Tell me if I'm wrong.

Tell me again.

I'm trying to tell me I'm wrong with that.

No.

You have found a market.

Okay.

Definitely.

But it is a market that is primarily going to these places called hospitals.

I've never heard of that.

You've never been to one.

How can I be to something I haven't heard of?

Have you ever been sick before?

And what happens?

What do you do?

What's your process?

Well, first I look myself in the mirror.

You look yourself in the mirror as the first step.

I look myself in the mirror.

You have a good laugh because laughter is the best medicine.

Good answer.

You understand?

That's what I've been doing.

And that's what they've been saying for ages.

And I think what if medicine was the best medicine?

And that's what I'm trying to say.

But what I do when I fall ill is I look myself in the mirror and I say, is this really happening?

Why me?

And then...

You think that this may be like a simulation or something where it's not really happening and it's like the matrix where suddenly someone's going to red pill you.

By the way, I'd love to red pill you before we show.

What does it mean to red pill someone?

Well, it's taken on some poor connotations lately.

Yeah, yeah.

Because I was just yes-anding my way through.

Comedy bang bang more sexual than we expected.

What is that?

I'll tell you by the end of the show.

Is that what happens?

You can look it up after the show.

Okay, never heard of that.

Never heard of that.

Oh, okay.

Don't let someone do it to you.

Okay.

But what were we talking about?

Oh, yeah.

Do you think it's like the matrix where you're where you have a different body somewhere else and it's not really happening?

I've never seen the matrix.

Oh, really?

I've never seen it.

But I do wonder when I fall ill and I start to feel weak in the knees, I say to myself, is this real?

Is it real?

How do you determine if it is or not?

Well, then I touch the mirror and I say, okay, we're here.

We're here with you like this.

You're touching something in your physical proximity to it might be a dream.

It might be.

Right.

So maybe if the matrix is a dream, maybe I thought I was in it, but I haven't seen it to say one way or the other.

I wouldn't call it a dream Langston, right?

No, it's more of a digital stimulation.

But a mental digital stimulation.

Although when you say digital stimulation, that also has some some connotations that show is very sexual.

You are feeling sexual.

I'm a horny.

Well, speaking of horny, I'm a horny.

Speaking of horny, speaking of horn.

Yes.

I have another invention.

I'd like if you don't want to invest in the cube like treatment center.

Why is the cube part of it so integral to?

Well, I'm learning new shapes now.

You told me rectangle.

You told me Arumbas.

Arumbas.

Okay.

Understood.

Arumbas is something that would clean up your hospital.

Okay.

Oh, okay.

Well, she doesn't recognize as a name.

I don't know what that is.

You don't know what Arumba is.

What's your new invention?

My new invention is for horny people.

Okay.

Pornin men.

It's a it's like a balloon.

You've cut your market in half immediately.

You said horny people and then horny men.

Well, because it's particular.

Okay.

It's like a balloon.

Okay.

You would put a top your little man to protect you from diseases.

So you don't have to go to the cube.

So I'm also kind of undercutting my own business.

Yeah.

Like if you really wanted, and I think by the way what you're mentioning is a condom.

What is that?

That is a latex or if you're allergic to latex perhaps lam skin protective covering for your little man.

Okay.

Or big man depending on how horny you are.

How pink you are.

You know how it grows then changes shape depending on horny love.

Yeah, changes shape.

Changes shape.

You do a rhombus sometimes.

A change of show.

Okay.

And it protects your your man and also protects the recipient of your lovemaking from any secretions that may come out of the what I call the cyclops hole at the very, very tippy tip.

You call the pussier cyclops.

Oh no.

Oh, you mean the head that the penis head.

The penis head has a little odd.

The cyclops.

I see.

I've never seen a penis.

But you've never seen one?

Never seen.

I've heard of them.

Wait, but these have heard of you.

You already planned an invention despite not having seen it.

I've heard of them though.

I have male friends.

Sure.

I've heard of them.

And you're an older woman and you've had relationships with women than your whole life for a week.

No, I've had relationships with men.

Oh, but you just have never gone down.

Your tonic.

Yeah.

No, I don't go downtown.

I don't go downtown.

I'm not going to be there.

Would you say which base?

Which base have you gone visited?

Home base.

And what do you consider to be home base in a relationship with a man?

A phone call.

Where they call you or you call them?

A phone.

We've they call me.

They call you.

Okay.

So you calling them is what?

Third base.

That's that.

That's a lady.

Yes.

That's a lady.

That's really put myself.

Yeah.

That's them calling you back.

That's a home run.

That's what we call a home run where I'm from.

We mentioned him the last time you were on the show that you had a brother.

And we don't know what he does or what his life is like, but I'm here to interview him.

You brought him.

We asked you to bring him here.

Yeah.

Okay.

And it took I had to get in touch with him.

I had to.

That's usually the first step in trying to relay any kind of information with anyone.

Are you guys a strange?

No, we are not a strange.

Successful people don't have time for each other.

I think that we all know that, right?

Yeah.

That's the excuse that I get.

Successful.

It's all my friends.

I'm successful.

That's your successful.

I'm successful.

Enough said.

So it took some work to get in touch with him.

He has several assistants.

He has several assistants come up with a lot of I don't want to paint him into a corner now.

Sure.

You don't want to tell us too much about about his life.

I've been there before painted into a corner.

Oh, really?

Yes.

That's right.

The last time you were on.

Excuse me.

Not me.

I'm trippinua.

I know a friend who was painted into a corner.

Which friend was that?

Diallet coach.

Darlatin Castle.

Oh, yeah.

That was a very unusual episode.

Painted deep into a corner.

That was couldn't make sense of the show.

That was like, yes.

And here's what you are.

And and and and and and and and and how about this?

So I won't paint him into a corner, but he has several assistants.

A lot of business ideas.

We're not as strange, but again, successful people don't particularly have.

Sure.

So you don't you may not even know what he's been up to.

I don't, but I know whatever it is, it's going to be good.

Okay.

Well, he's here to tell us everything about himself.

We mentioned him on the last time you were on the show and we begged you to to bring him here and he's here today.

Please welcome to the show.

Appetizer.

Pea newer.

Thank you for having me.

It is not good.

Things are not okay.

I'm not okay.

Wait a minute.

I thought she's successful.

You're successful.

You thought that much of thought wrong.

You so many assistants.

And when he says thought wrong, he means T H O T.

You thought wrong.

That over there.

He's got it.

Oh, Scotty.

You mind if I call you that.

That's what Scotty would.

Foddy.

Scotty.

Fatty.

Sure.

You mind if I say that to you, Scotty makes you comfortable.

Sure.

You know what I'm talking about.

I'm not a good guy.

Things are not good.

Oh, lord.

Oh, you see.

Appetizer.

Pea newer.

Appetizer.

Pea newer.

Yes, that's right.

My mother.

My newer.

Oh, how I love my new.

My newer.

What field was she in?

My new.

What field was manure in?

Gardening.

Okay.

When she sick.

And I'm straight.

I came to see you.

Oh, you guys are estranged.

We are.

No, I wouldn't say that.

I'm busy.

I would.

We're not estranged.

I'm busy.

A strange.

She didn't even know that my newer was sick.

My newer sick.

Throwing up all over the place and let me tell you it's mad.

It smells bad.

You didn't know.

Oh, her.

You heard about this.

Oh, no.

I've been taking care of my newer.

Oh.

And I had to move back home.

I had to quit all my jobs.

I didn't mention to you that my brother appetizer here.

Before he found his true calling in life, he attempted to be a pastor.

Oh, you did.

Okay.

So that's what you're you have a certain cadence.

It's a Martin Luther King sort of vibe.

I attempted to be a pastor, but I couldn't do it because I started worshiping the devil.

Oh, well, that would get in the way.

How did you end up with the devil?

It seems that people like Baptist churches don't like talking about the devil.

Yeah, but I tried to convert him.

You were actively trying to convert Christians into Satanism.

That's right.

I tried.

And I tried.

What was it about the devil for you that you like so much?

What?

Have you ever seen the devil in a pair of dungarees?

Low-rise jeans.

Oh, David Bookka.

Oh, yes.

The P-newers.

Now here's a little behind the scenes trivia for the gang.

Okay.

I came in to the studio.

That's right.

Towards the end of this episode.

That's right.

Paul Eptonkins occasionally comes on as a character named classic Charles.

Classic Charles.

His name is Charles and somehow we, your first episode, I believe, we said that was just classic and so we started a hashtag, classic Charles.

Did I do Charles or did I just watch a little bit?

When you did Charles the first time?

No, no, no.

For this episode.

Oh, no.

You just came in, I believe.

You did Charles.

Yeah.

I did do Charles.

You did do Charles.

I don't remember doing Charles, but I do remember this.

That when it was time for plugs and you're going around the room, you ask Langston, you ask, you know, on-tray, do you have any plugs on-tray P-nor?

Carl was on his phone and was not recognizing the name that he was being addressed by.

This happens occasionally.

Yes.

I don't want to call out exactly who was on their phone during the show the most.

It's Carl.

And there's another person.

I think I know what you mean, but everyone is now, it gets to the point where everyone is yelling.

Yes.

He's not recognizing it.

He's not looking up.

He's not even-he's not even curious about what the commotion is.

Yeah.

He does not care what's going on.

Yeah.

Mirror inches from me.

I never wanted it to end.

It was amazing.

Because every time you would think like, well, now he's surely he knows everyone's yelling.

Surely he knows we're all yelling.

No, never.

He never did.

Yeah.

Really fun.

All right.

We're going to go to a break.

When we come back, we are going to, I guess, continue with the countdown, but we're going to do, we're going to skip to number one, but this is number one of the live episodes.

Oh, Scott, you gave me quite a start.

Ha ha ha ha.

You arose with such a clatter.

I would to see what was the matter in window time.

Window times.

Where's window?

That's a- Where's window?

That's a reference from, I believe, our first and procreation episodes.

I'll tell you where it's for.

Never heard of them.

Sure.

All right.

We'll go to a break.

When we come back, we'll have your number one live episode.

Nom nom nom nom.

Comedy bang bang.

We are back with part two of the best ofs.

I'm back.

I am too.

Paul of Tomkins is here as well.

I'm also back with these.

And this is exciting.

This year we did a few, we went on tour and we called it our 10th anniversary tour.

And Paul do you think we're going to do some more dates come 2020 or are we done?

I'm trying to set them up.

So I'm hoping that you will.

Oh.

Yeah.

Oh.

We had this convo off my we did.

And you agreed?

Which I had been sober.

Ha ha ha ha.

Well, hopefully we are going to do a few more shows next year.

Yeah man.

It's always fun.

We have a good time together.

It's always a great time.

And this year was no exception.

And I thought, you know what, most of all of those shows go up on Stitcher Premium where a fraction of our listeners are able to hear them.

So I thought, why not take a poll of those people who were able to hear them so we could play a clip from the winner right here on air.

Yes.

Let the rich people vote as well.

Rattle your jewelry.

So we put all of them up there.

And Paul, you were on most of them.

I believe you did.

You were not in the San Francisco show.

I'm trying to think of there was any other one this year.

Yeah, this year.

Clusterfest was the name is an illusion to curse words.

Yeah, you don't like that.

I couldn't do it.

But other than that, I think you were in all of them.

And Lauren, I think was was in all of them because she did Clusterfest.

I should have looked up these stats.

But yeah, but you and you and Lauren and I did almost all of them.

And then we had a rotating group of people of guest stars who had come in.

We previously mentioned Carl.

Tarte did some, Igo Wodum.

We had Andy Daley on a few of them.

Sean Diston came up to Portland or happened to be in Portland and came and did both shows up there.

Yes.

Yes, Queen.

And so if you had to guess, do you want to guess what hit number one?

The San Francisco one that I wasn't a part of.

Yeah.

Of course not.

That one was great though.

People said listen to that one.

Do you know, it's hard for me to guess because they were all really fun shows.

They're all really good.

Yeah.

Sometimes I sometimes feel those live shows are us at our best.

Mmm.

Yeah, it's the pressure of the audience.

It is.

I wish there was an audience here other than just Kevin.

I wildly, disticulating and waving.

He has not relented.

No, he must be exhausted.

I don't, I feel like one of our family members has passed away or something.

He's been trying to get our attention.

He's been like Kermit the frogging his arms.

And not the mean, which you get to take.

No, not the mean drink.

Drink it.

That's the mean where you get the tea.

All right.

Let me just reveal what has, which cream has risen to the top.

This is your number one.

Are you still using that which cream?

You'll never be a witch.

I want to.

Two, they have some pretty noses.

You're not a witch.

You're me.

All right.

This is your number one live episode.

Number one.

All right.

This is live from Chicago, Chicago, that Toddlin town.

All right.

So this.

Toddling town.

This one was Paul yourself, Lauren, myself, Carl Tarte.

Was there himself?

himself and Jason Mazzucus happened to be touring with How did this get made his own podcast at the very same theater the night previous.

And I thought that was an amazing coincidence.

And when I heard that I reached out to him and said, do you want to stay an extra night?

And then the negotiations began.

What it would take to get him to stay.

Emotional negotiation.

Exactly.

Emotional negotiations.

And so he very nicely agreed stayed in Chicago another night and gave the audience a thrill.

And this was such this was a crazy show.

This was a really nuts one.

And this was the premiere of what we call the dink dink man.

And it happens before this clip.

And let me see if I can recall exactly what happened.

I can't recall if you were on stage at the time, but we were talking about Jason was miming being in one of those walkers.

The metal walkers that people use.

Who is walkers use?

Yes.

Yeah.

And he was miming it and he was making a noise as he was doing it going dink dink dink as in the metal tapping upon the ground or something.

And thus the dink dink man was born.

Do you remember anything about it?

I think that I referenced it later.

We do hear it in the clip, but that happened before this clip is we talked about the noise the walker made dink dink dink.

And I think we just not a noise that a walker makes.

No, but then I think we called him the dink dink man.

Yes.

That became a runner throughout the show.

I think it was also a reference somehow to John Wick because he played the tick tock man.

And so he's the dink dink man now.

I don't know exactly what happened, but the dink dink man became a runner where Jason basically played an insane ghoul who would pop up like a urban legend.

An urban legend.

So we're going to hear a clip from.

I wondered how this show would play in an audio medium because there was so much physical stuff happening.

We were all acting out a ton of stuff.

What happened was what had happened was we were playing bigger venues and the shows were longer because we didn't take an opener this time.

We wanted to give everyone a full show.

And I think because of the length of time that we were out on stage, we started acting things out more.

The show became much more physical.

Also because the stools are uncomfortable to sit on for such a long time.

Okay.

I'm just saying.

And also the venues are big, so we thought we needed to get a little more physical.

Yes.

So that's the back of the house could.

But mainly the reason is because once we started doing it, it was so much fun to do that we were.

And we look for any excuse to every show.

Well, let's act it out.

So that happens in this clip.

But this one was particularly ludicrous.

This whole episode is crazy.

We're just going to hear a 10 minute clip from it.

But just a brief, just a brief, I mean, it is briefer than most of the other.

True.

Let's hear it.

This is your number one live.

Number one.

Before we get to your new relationship, just to let everyone know who big Sue is, you're an entrepreneur, you have a store, an Emporium that sells carpets.

Carpets, roads down there.

It's got sipping wet carpets.

They're all sipping wet because the toilet's overflow.

You've not been able to fix those.

I haven't gotten them fixed because I keep shitting Scott.

It seems to me if you were to take the step of using the toilets.

I use them.

What?

If you were to take the step of fixing it before, like in between.

Why would I?

She's got you there, Scott.

I live in the store, Scott.

You're not continuously shitting all day long.

I'm not.

He thinks he knows me.

What if you got like a porta.

That's a big presumption.

What if you got a porta putty for the period of time that the toilet is being fixed?

You want me to shit outside.

You're an animal.

I also have an invention I've been making out of my shit wet rocks.

An invention.

And so the toilets are overflowing with shit.

So the rugs are soaked in shit, not the water from the toilet, but the shit from your butt that's been in the toilet.

The water gets in there.

I'm going to serve the water as well.

Thank you.

Who's he?

This is our alimony.

It's very supportive.

Bob, not before me right about alimony.

Alimony Tony.

Jack your own.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

I'm so okay.

What's your invention?

Well, my invention is this.

So you know when you're shitting and your body is an L.

You're what?

Your body is an L.

Why would you put your feet out?

This is more.

Your body is an L.

That's the only way you should.

You're on the toilet.

I'm usually like a lowercase H.

I'm like a five.

So we're all different.

You're all.

We're all feeding forward.

What do you do?

Let me think about a five.

That's how I shit.

I'm an L.

I'm like this.

He does the pretzel.

So rich.

That's how I rich guy shit.

He has time to kill.

I'm an extremely comfortable toilet.

And pennies fall out of your ass.

Wow.

You're rich.

I love a rich man.

I'm wealthy, yes.

Well, it's nice.

I do okay.

Okay.

But you sue your in and out.

I'm in and out.

I'm like this, but I always want to be like this.

So I'm making, I'm cutting all the carpets up to make a big stack around the toilet for you to put your legs on.

You should just get a squatty potty.

What?

A squatty potty does exactly that.

It's a thing that raises your feet up like this while you're on the toilet to make your elimination cleaner.

Does it put your feet up to your ears?

It can, yeah.

What?

I got, I got, I won't fuck my invention then.

The squatty pottys are normally clean and don't have shit all over them.

And that's where my invention takes the left turn.

Yeah.

Good business model.

Thank you.

No, I meant the, well.

Oh, them?

Do you sell a lot of rugs?

That's the biggest issue.

We're having a liquidation sale right now.

That's pretty liquid or not.

They're not on sale, right?

Everything must go.

Please God.

Take the rugs.

Take them.

They're shag.

They're wet.

They're soggy.

They wait 10 times more than you want them to.

Isn't that what they're proposing be replaced on the Statue of Liberty?

Please take our rugs.

They're wet.

They're shag.

I thought you were picturing coating her in a rug.

Yeah.

Well, yeah, because we got to dress her up more.

She's so drab.

Big Sue Baeoska question.

The rugs, how are they displayed at your store if they're all tainted of this way?

Yes.

Are they just all laid out on top of the store?

I don't want another top of the room.

Like the princess in the pee kind of situation.

Have you been to a rug store?

Yes.

Okay.

Out of curiosity, what was it like there?

Normally, I walk in.

I mean...

Do you want to act it out?

Yeah, yeah.

May I play the rug store all proprietor?

Or see you're me?

Well, this is a different rug store.

This is a different rug store.

It's a different rug store.

Okay, that only means...

This is what I think a rug store is like.

You can have a competing business next door.

I've only ever had rug stores.

This is the door to the rug store, right?

Typical door.

Jason, who you learn to be in this?

I'm just letting you guys do this.

Would you like to be an extra, be like another customer?

I'll be as an around.

I'll be a utility player.

Background doctor.

Can I be an extra?

Well, certainly.

Okay.

I'm in here already.

Yes.

Okay.

I'm a customer.

I worked for you.

Dealers choice.

You're a customer.

Thank you.

I'm here behind the carpet counter.

Okay.

Oh, another day facing this dreary existence.

You have this?

Working for a living.

Do you have this in blue?

Hey, pal.

What can I help you?

You're looking for something?

I don't have any money.

Hiya.

Can I help a friend?

Can I help you with something?

I'm fine.

Excuse me.

I've told you a hundred times.

I told you a hundred times you're not supposed to be in here.

Yeah, watch out.

This guy's no good.

What?

I'm an honest merchant.

You're no good?

No, I have to believe it.

Don't believe the dink dink dink dink dink dink dink.

Don't believe the dink dink dink dink dink.

Should I leave?

Don't or no, please stay.

I might leave.

No, please stay.

That's just the dink dink man.

I heard that he said you're a bad guy.

No, no, no.

He's a bad guy.

He tortures children.

Okay.

Don't go out a night because the dink dink man is okay.

What?

You just interrupted something terrifying.

What?

I can't go out at night.

It's a legend around town.

Then the spirit called the dink dink man.

Do you guys hear that?

He's shot up.

He steals children.

What?

He steals children from their beds and tickles their feet with a feather.

This is terrifying.

It's not true.

It can't be true.

What did he do to adults?

He mostly just says don't worry about what I'm doing.

Okay.

But adults he says I don't worry about so I really wouldn't have to worry.

But that's a local vagrant.

We call him the dink dink man because he looks so scary.

Oh no.

Okay, well do you have this one in blue?

Yes.

Okay, I want that.

I'm interested.

All right.

Why are you kicking water?

I don't know.

It's stores very messy.

I'll have that sent to your home.

Well, where do I live?

Well, you've got me there.

So you were just going to send it to my home but you weren't going to ask for any of my details?

I guess I thought we'd have more of a conversation but things move.

They escalate it very quickly.

Do you want me to tell you where I live?

Would you want to see?

Yes, please.

Please.

Excuse me.

You seem very busy.

Oh please.

Please.

I'd love to sell you a cup but I have to work all day.

Now where I live is very hard to find.

Okay.

It's in an alley between two alleys.

So not a traditional home?

Not exactly.

It looks traditional.

It's got a roof, two windows, a door but it's very small for a mouse.

Now I am a lady with magical powers.

I zap down and become small and walk in.

In there I do whatever you want to do.

Are you going to see this?

In your home.

Well that's just the dink dink dink man ignore it.

That's the dink dink man.

We call them the dink dink man.

The dink dink dink man is unreal.

Do you make it a delivery to my house if I can't tell where I live?

Dink dink dink.

Of course I get very tiny.

Of course.

And I walk in and I take baths, sleep, nap.

Right.

No.

Make dinner.

Order food from Postmates.

When you order food what kind of food do you order?

I order Chinese or maybe even Chipotle.

But sometimes I order a pizza.

Oh pizza.

Yeah.

What kind of pizza would you order?

Are you ordering it for me?

I could if you'd like.

You want to get on the horn?

I could send a pizza and a carpet at the same time.

Okay great.

I want a round pie.

A little bit of sauce.

Some cheese.

Maybe a pepperoni.

Maybe some soy sauce.

Hey Tony I got all those rugs organized in the back.

I'm not about to go to lunch.

You needed me to do anything?

Thanks Carl.

You're a good employee of my business that I have.

Okay.

Well I'm going to go on my lunch break.

Couldn't he help me?

I've been sitting here.

Excuse me.

Dink dink dink.

You've been ranting about the dink dink man.

He's right behind you.

Carl that's absurd.

What do you want?

What?

What is it?

I'm trying to run a business here.

I'm trying to make a sale.

You're making a sale?

By buying.

It takes two people to make a sale.

What person to sell?

What person to buy?

What do you want?

You walked in here like you own the place.

You don't.

Who do you think I've come out from buying this counter before?

Oh dude.

Do you think you own sir?

I do.

Look.

You're taking a video with us?

Are you taking a video?

Are you taking a video on us?

I'm so excited.

I'm taking a video of this.

Wow.

Who are you, the bagel boss?

Listen.

You're not my father.

You're not God.

And you're not a customer.

Well, what do you want me to do to you?

I hope you'll rush at me and fight me.

And scene.

Scene.

All right.

That's that's that's Chicago is how a rug store works.

Oh, there we go.

Fun show to do.

No way.

Did you get the singers to sing the word live?

No, I didn't.

By the way, this is the first year you're listening to it.

Have I ever talked about the singers?

I don't think we ever have.

Okay.

So the first year, okay, as we talked about, you and I both grew up listening to radio in the 70s and 80s and raised by radio.

And there was this thing.

And people had jobs just doing this where they they would sing in these harmonies.

Things like, you know, one oh six point seven kiss FM or one oh two points.

And this was a job for people and they would all do it in harmonies and they would all do these and if you had a radio station, you could, you know, pay them to sing anything.

Mr. G in the morning.

And so Mr. G.

Hello, I'm Mr. G with morning time.

Now let's listen to the topics of the day.

We have, of course, the elegance.

Here's Paul some sugar on me.

Lady whimper Smith on weather on the tens.

I beg of you, if you know me in life, do not divulge my identity.

I must remain Mr. G in the morning.

Oh, hey, Mr. Gogginzola.

I would have him removed.

Do you want me to take the drive out?

From the studio.

No, it was no.

I'm Italian.

This is a guy who's second generation Italian American who doesn't want anyone to know.

He's ashamed.

Yes.

Why are we talking?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

So anyway, I when when we were counting down, I think the first year maybe it was 10 top 10 episodes of the year.

I looked at I was like that was what I was used to.

I just thought it was funny to find those radio people saying number 10 number because that went anytime on a radio when you had a countdown.

They would use these.

And so I don't know where I found them.

I feel like I found them on LimeWire or something.

I mean, this is 11 years ago.

10 years ago.

And so I found MP3s of these singers singing number one through 10 and I and we didn't have it up to 20.

So when we do them, we have to when we do 11 through 15, we have to have them repeat the numbers number one, five for 15.

Anyway, I don't know where if anyone has any MP3s of them doing 11 through two.

Although at this point, it's fun.

And I don't know that I would change it.

You know, here's the thing though.

Because if you get up, if you start doing a top 20 countdown, which I know you fucking will.

Who me?

Yeah.

Who me?

I'm laughing in a Tony Goulton's mouth.

What are you going to do?

Number 10, 10.

Yeah, that's true.

No, they would probably go up to number 20.

If you're just said you didn't have.

I don't have no, no, I don't have it.

Yeah.

Oh, you're right.

So I can never do it.

Yeah, right.

I can only do one nine.

Yeah.

I mean, 10 would be funny.

What if we did a top 50?

It was number 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.

Oh, I hate it.

Here's what I'm going to do.

Or would it be number five?

Oh, oh, I guess what if we got a bunch of people together and all saying it that are people that are regulars on the show that can sing.

We do a recording session and we do a bunch of numbers of words that you just have just have and any word.

I mean, we they would have to be common words live.

And well, words that you say the bonus.

Like where do you think you would use?

Okay.

Hey.

Yeah.

Hey.

Hey, Paul.

Why?

Bye.

But then would you be tempted to start using them in the regular show?

Yeah, I might be.

I know.

And then it just turns into drops.

Yeah.

We got that toilet flush.

All right.

This is what happens.

We're only halfway through.

We're going to be back on Monday with episode three of four and we're going to be counting down eight, seven, six, five, three, oh nine.

We will be back Monday.

Thanks.

Don't worry.

Don't look at this point.

We've recorded it already.

We've been going backwards.

We've been speaking backwards.

You like it's coming back in style.

It's really difficult to do.

Sometimes I think I look like her, but my arms been back.

All right.

We'll see you on Monday for part three.

Bye.
