♪♪♪ If robots had robots, we'd all have sore hands Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Thank you to David Mamet's Gunt for that catchphrase submission.

All right, thank you, David Mamet's Gunt.

I don't know that that one's going to switch.

Oh, it may switch.

May not stick.

Welcome back to the top of my game.

Welcome back to the show.

My name is Scott Ockermann, and we have a great show.

Come here a little later.

We have a businessman.

We also have a comedian, but before we get to them, let me just tell you, stars are back.

Stars are back on Comedy Bang Bang.

We had a real fallow period there for a while during the...

I mean, we had stars during the COVID because they would all say, like, oh, I'll do it over Zoom.

That's the most commitment they would give me is they'll do it over Zoom.

So we had some stars, but then we moved into my backyard outside where no stars would go, other than Anders Holm, who showed up a day early, and then came back to his credit, came back the next day.

But now stars are back on the show, and we have one of the biggest here with us today.

You know her from such incredible shows as the increasingly poor decisions of Todd Margaret.

You know her from catastrophe, which she was Emmy nominated for co-creating with our good friend Rob Delaney.

Oh, my God.

You know her from this way up with her friend to the show, and she's a great, great, amazingbie.

And she is in a new show, which is on Apple Plus, Apple TV Plus, Apple TV Plus, which basically if you're rich, you can get Apple TV Plus.

And it's the streaming service of rich people all across this great country.

It's called Bad Sisters, and she's in it, she's created it.

And I'm the amazing Sharon Horgan. Hello.

Hi.

It's Ashling.

Ashling, well, you know.

It's a bit...

Not Aisling.

Well, I kind of said it in between those two things.

And because the whole show is out now, Bad Sisters, episodes one to ten, you don't have to be rich, because you can just sign up for the weekly, you can try it for a week.

I'm not saying people should do that, I'm just saying they could.

They could, but will they?

I think they will, they might.

I don't know. I've told Adam's got this.

It's the rich person's streaming service, because it costs just about as much as any other streaming service, but they have so few things on it.

So it's like...

But when they have such quality, but it just feels like a lavish expense to...

Yeah, that's it.

I agree.

I think it's, you know, quality over...

I mean, I don't particularly love watching, you know, teen romances set on Long Island or whatever.

Which shows are we talking about?

No, I'm just like, no, it's...

Are these, do you mean the Jersey Shore type reality shows, or do you mean actual fictional teen romances?

I mean, there's a lot of TV out there, isn't there?

There certainly is. We're at Peak TV.

Yeah.

And you are thriving in it.

Thank you.

You are having a field day with Peak TV, some of the greatest shows of all time.

And they're all available on different things, Catastrophies on Amazon, this way up on Hulu, I believe, here in the States.

Correct.

And this, of course, Bad Sisters on Apple TV Plus.

House Broken on Fox.

House Broken on Fox, and HBO.

You have the...

Shining Veil on Stars.

Divorced.

I mean, you're not on it.

Divorced is no more though.

Yes, but it's on HBO Max, one would assume.

Oh, yeah, maybe.

Yeah.

I never saw it.

Did they get divorced in the first episode or the last episode?

Well...

Or did they get divorced in the first and remarried in the last?

Or how did it go?

They decided to get a divorce in the first.

These things take a while, you know.

Are you divorced yourself?

I'm not.

It's so weird.

I'm still with my ex-girlfriend.

Ah!

We married.

But they take a bit of time.

Yeah.

And that's basically what's the last episode?

They get served the papers or...

You don't know.

I wasn't involved in the last season.

Oh, really?

Oh, okay.

But that's start the Sandman, did it not?

Huh?

Thomas Hayden Church.

I can tell you how disappointed I was.

I turned on that new Netflix show, The Sandman.

Yeah.

And Thomas Hayden Church isn't in it.

Not in it.

That's so weird.

It's so crazy.

Because he signed that contract when he did the film.

Exactly.

That is bizarre.

Yeah.

Anyway, let's talk about Bad Sisters.

Bad Sisters, I've seen a good chunk of it at this point.

How much is a good chunk?

Three.

Okay, that's a good one.

Three's good, right?

Well, they're an hour too.

So that's, you know.

Yeah.

And you just got booked yesterday last minute.

Fuck off.

But it's a really good show.

It's, I could explain the premise, but why don't you?

Well, it's about five sisters.

And one of them is married to a prick on...

Probably the world's worst person, just from the three episodes I've seen.

He gets progressively worse and worse.

And then he gets progressively worse after the...

After the third episode, he's even worse?

He just reached...

He even worse.

Just such an apex of prickishness in the third one.

Yeah.

I mean, what he doesn't ever say three is pretty monstrous, but it does get worse.

So, yeah, she's married to a prick and then they decide that they're going to take him out.

The series starts at his funeral.

That's it, yeah.

And then it flashes back to see the increasingly...

Just how much they hate him, they grow to hate this guy.

And one by one, they all decide, what if we maybe murdered this guy?

But we also don't know if any of them did, or because it's a mystery, and there are...

It's kind of a, like a how-done-it, I think.

Right.

Also, they are...

Also a why-done-it.

Although we know why.

Yeah, well, you know why.

I mean, I guess it's a bit of a who-done-it.

It isn't where I've done it as well.

Yeah.

When?

It's the night before...

It's also when-done-it, it is.

The night before he was found dead.

Three.

So where-done-it, why-done-it, how-done?

Yeah.

But I guess the comedy premise is that they're all about it murder, because they're just normal folk, and I guess, you know, I mean, I figure I'd be pretty shit at murder if I'd even tried it.

Yeah.

I mean, I was, every once in a while, there'd be a scene where I'd be like, you can't...

They're bad at this, they can't do that, but then, like, the book about how to poison someone.

Yeah.

But then you cover your bases by saying, like, you know, did you check that out?

The library, there's gonna be, you know, a paper trail on that that could know I stole it from the library.

So I was like, okay, they're ahead of it.

They are.

I mean, they're gonna cover in their tracks so they're about it murder, but he's also really good at cheating deaths.

So it's kind of a bit like the cartoon equivalent would be, like, you know, Wylie, Coyote, and Roadrunner.

Right.

Two best friends who...

And...

I only watched the first, maybe 30 seconds of each of them.

And then the, I guess the second part, the premise is it's over two timelines.

So one timeline is them...

Plotting the murders.

And then the one that takes place in sort of the current, although it might take place in the future.

I think it's the present.

Does it take...

Is it, like, set in 2040?

It is very sci-fi.

People have lasers.

They...

There are insurance investigators who are investigating this.

Yeah.

Because they don't want to...

They can't pay out.

It's such a big claim.

It's going to ruin the business.

And so they have a personal investment.

Exactly.

So they got to prove sort of foul play.

But then there's also a kind of...

There's romance in there as well.

There's sort of a...

Sort of a Montague and Capulet type thing.

Yes.

Including a romance with Eve Hewson.

I'm not on the Cormac.

Did I meet her after her father's show at Madison Square Garden?

Yes!

She's the best.

And she...

She was very nice.

I have one question about your collaborators on this.

Okay.

True or false?

Dave Finkel.

One of the people who collaborated with you.

Uh-huh.

Appeared in a production of Jesus Christ Superstar when we were 19.

As Jesus Christ at Rio Hondo College near Los Angeles.

Did he?

True!

Oh!

Where I was, Anis, one of the priests?

What was he...

What was he?

He was Jesus.

He was Jesus?

Yes.

Did he ever sing on set?

No.

He can recall.

No.

Interesting though, isn't he?

Yes.

Very interesting.

You think about it?

Unexpected.

He'd never mentioned that.

That's a nugget that I'm going to have to try and get rid of now.

Yeah.

He was speaking of Bono.

Yeah.

He was dressed as Bono because we were all dressed as modern rock stars.

This is 1989.

He was wearing a fringe vest.

Like a Western vest in a black shirt.

Isn't this school production?

This was a college production.

Oh, college production.

Yes.

And Judas was dressed like Prince.

And we were the priests and we were dressed like kids.

And wrapped like the BC boys.

It actually was very good.

People were crying.

In tears everywhere.

Please bring this up tonight.

I haven't seen him in maybe a decade.

Would it surprise you to know that I haven't seen him since the Evander-Hullifield Mike Tyson fight where he...

Mike Tyson bit off Evander-Hullifields a year?

10 years ago.

That was somewhere around there.

That was the last time I saw him.

Seems like longer ago.

I think it was maybe 15 or so.

Oh, I can still feel it.

Oh, really?

You have empathetic feelings for the year.

With the year, yeah.

Really.

I actually saw someone get their ear bitten off in real life.

What happened?

I was at the Flah, which is an Irish sort of outdoor concert in Finzew Park in North London.

I was just hanging out with a load of punks.

Can you say punks?

I mean, like, you know...

Like punk rockers or just like a bunch of like neared wells?

No, punk punk.

But more sort of crusty punks.

Like older punks.

They were nearedy wells in fairness.

And one of them was just incredibly drunk and the other one was even drunker.

And they started having a fight.

And you could tell it wasn't going to end well, but I was not expecting him to go over and bite the guy's ear.

Bit of piece off and spotted that in front of my eyes.

And I still think, well, I'm talking about it.

It's still, it's stayed with me all these years later.

You don't want that to happen to you.

Sorry to tell that story.

Although I guess technically that that ear part is just like a protective flap.

It's just a protective flap, exactly.

So it's one of the only protective flaps we have on the body, is it not?

Is there not protective flap around your cock?

I had mine taken off when I was young.

Yeah.

And I'd say there's other protective flaps.

I'm not great at biology.

I guess the nose is a semi protective flap.

Lips.

Lips are protective flaps.

Let's list the top five protective flaps on the body.

You have ears number one as far as I'm concerned.

Please, Richard.

I mean, I guess that's number two.

Yeah.

Right.

Maybe number one for some people.

Since it's only half of the population or 51%, I would say that it has to drop down to number two because everyone has ears.

True, true.

It might go down to number five, actually.

Now that I think about it, just by numbers.

I don't know what else there is.

I don't know what else has excess hoodage.

Yeah.

I got, well, if you have an Audi navel.

I was going to say that.

Mm, yeah.

You didn't.

No.

It's not a competition, though.

Not on this show.

Bad Sisters is available now.

You can basically, how do you even get Apple TV Plus?

What do you have to do?

You have to like...

I don't know.

I have it, but I couldn't tell you how I got it.

I don't even...

I mean, if I'm honest, I don't really know how to turn it on.

I asked my younger story.

My eldest daughter was watching, but I asked my younger daughter if she watched it and she said, no.

And I said, why, Jake?

Because you don't know the login.

So it's very important.

If you sign up for Apple TV Plus, you have to remember your login.

Otherwise, you will not be able to see the show.

Yeah.

Or the password or something.

But I have recently got my head around it, so I can watch my show now, but I've watched it 500 times.

Right.

Were you in the edit and everything?

I was, yeah.

Yeah.

That's fun.

Yeah, I love it.

Snip here, snip there.

Yeah, make a bet.

Make this shorter.

Make it longer.

Move this scene.

Move that scene.

That's why.

This is what people do in the editing room.

You sound like you know you're in the edit room.

Oh, I know my way around one.

Avid.

Final cut.

Well, it's a great show.

The three I've watched are very, very gripping.

My wife and I watched them together.

And she had actually started before I did.

And she's a huge, huge fan.

And she, we've been watching them together.

And I made her go back and rewatch the first one and a half that she had already seen.

And this story's going nowhere.

Do you agree?

I love that little.

A little.

I kind of bailed out mentally.

I wasn't sure for it.

I was in the room.

Right?

But it's good.

It's a good show, right?

My show.

Yeah.

Bad sister.

Yeah.

I think it's very good.

Yeah.

And I think it's very good.

Could there even be a second?

Is there a second season of clown?

No, no, no.

There's no second season of clown, but there is.

I did sort of think that that was it.

You know?

You mentally had written it off.

Oh, yeah, completely.

This should go with the Emmy campaign.

I had mentally written this off for your consideration.

It ended there.

And I felt like we...

I did the ending.

You did.

I wanted and I was delighted with it.

And then, you know, people liked the show and they liked the sisters.

And so if I could be...

Could be you'd die.

If I could think of a really good reason to do it, which could be me dying, which could be nice because then I could, you know, just get on with the writing.

Well, you would be in the flashbacks, I'm sure, where you suddenly start acting like a prick to your sisters and they go like, man, we gotta kill her.

That feels like it's half written now.

So thank you for your...

Yeah, I look at...

I'm willing to give you any kind of ideas for free.

Really?

Yeah, exactly.

But I felt bad taking them from you because...

Don't worry about it.

No, please.

I love it.

Give me a shout out.

Name a character after me.

Or at least make a character look like me and a friend of mine like Nick Kroll hits.

No, in big mouth.

Oh, yeah.

You might have looked like all of them.

Yeah, a friend of mine and I look exactly like two characters.

Really?

And yet we do not voice them.

That is gone.

We'll talk to him about that on a future show.

But Bad Sisters is...

I keep wanting to say in stores or in theaters, but it's just there in a TV.

It's just in the TV now.

It's in the TV.

Yeah.

It's like ones and zeros.

Yeah.

Yeah, isn't that crazy to think about?

Your life's work is just ones and zeros.

I don't really think about it like that.

Yeah.

Great ones and zeros, like some of the best, but still ones and zeros nonetheless.

Super.

Well, it's a great show for what I've seen of it and I'm going to devour the next seven.

And I hope there's another season.

Maybe she could get married to someone else who's bad.

Like she's got bad luck with, you know.

You know, I have had some of these very ideas.

Maybe you get married to someone.

But...

And you're like, now we got a taste for it.

But you know when you do something and people...

I even like the guy.

I want to murder it.

If you do something and people like it, it is a bit scary to do it again.

It's much easier to have like a...

If you do something that comes into its own by the second or third...

Do a white lotus with it and make it about a different family.

It's not what they did.

In white lotus, it's now about, other than Jennifer Coolidge, a different spot, a different group of vacationers.

Oh, it's a different white lotus hotel, isn't it?

Yes, exactly.

So...

I'm in for that.

Yeah.

I don't know if my show could work in that way.

It's not set in a hotel.

Well, it's about another group of sisters who hate some dude for whatever reason.

That's another good idea.

Maybe they want to kill the president.

And it's like an assassination attempt.

Okay.

So set it here or like the president?

Set it in America.

No, set it in America.

On the rear.

And it's during an election season.

Right.

And there's a big debate going on and there's a countdown to...

Is this like a fake president or...

Oh.

You want to make it a bit to the fly on the wall?

I guess so, yeah.

It could be fake, although it could be analogous to what's going on.

Right, right, right, right.

So it's like, you know what I mean?

So it's...

And then like you see basically like the opening scene is the fake president gets up there and says, well, I'm here today and then boom, get shot in the head.

And then like, it's all of his sisters.

Like who...

Who done it?

Yeah.

Exactly.

It feels like a different show.

The more I say, the more I kind of spit all this out.

But you know, it's a good time to have another show up your sleeve.

Yeah, there you go.

He shows up your sleeve.

Well, bad sisters, we all want to watch this.

Scroung up, what is Apple TV Plus?

It's like $20 a month.

Like a fiber?

Is it a fiber?

No, it's way more than $20.

Is it?

Yeah.

He sure.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Maybe a five in England.

Oh yeah, no.

Whatever that translates to here.

That our currency is destroyed.

Exactly.

We're going to take a break.

When we come back, we have...

Are you excited about this?

We have a business person that we're going to talk to next.

Oh, wow.

I am excited about that.

You're sort of a business person, the business of show business.

I love this.

Yeah, exactly.

So you have a lot to talk about.

Maybe.

All right, great.

Has he got briefcase?

We'll figure that out.

I don't know.

I've never asked him that question.

He's been on the show before.

I've never asked him if he has a briefcase.

This is a great first question.

All right, I'm going to write this down.

You're really good at this.

Okay, I need you here by my side to talk to these people.

I'm happy to be having a site to meet a business person.

Good question, briefcase.

Okay, whoops.

Just through the pan everywhere.

All right, we're going to take a break.

Sharon Horgan is here.

Bad sisters.

We're going to take a break.

We're going to be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back.

Sharon Horgan is here.

Bad sisters.

Who came up with the title?

Well, I did.

I did want to call it clan like the Belgian original, but it's tricky here to call something clan.

Yeah, we can't even in a baseball game when there's three strikeouts.

They can't.

And because if you go to a baseball stadium, baseball, by the way, do I need to explain that?

Yeah, he could.

That would be great.

I don't know.

I don't really know.

Okay.

But you go to a baseball stadium and they when any when there's a strikeout, the pitcher, the pitcher is the guy on the the.

I know what a pitcher is.

You know what a pitcher.

Yeah.

And he throws the ball across that plate, which I just figured out 50 years into my life that it's shaped like a house.

Ooh.

Because it's home plate.

Ah.

Yeah.

Anyway, he throws it across a plate and if he strikes the batters out, there's a the letter K, which stands for strikeout.

That's the shortcut to the abbreviation for strikeout is K for whatever reason.

But you can't do three of those in a row because of the whole clan thing.

K, K, K. So when they the third one, whenever like they get the third strikeout, they they like light up something else or they.

Well, they do.

Fair enough.

Yeah.

You know, because they don't want to they do they do it back.

Oh, that's right.

They do it backwards.

Oh, no.

It's still three K.

It's still three Ks.

But one looks like it's like cool looking K.

Yeah.

Anyway, so yeah, you didn't.

So you so then did you what were some of the the alternate titles that you pitched?

Oh my God.

I can't I almost don't want to relive it because it was such a bad time.

Laid killers.

It was I mean, honest to God, just some of the worst ideas of all time.

And I wish I could remember some of them.

I think I've got like PTSD because it's really hard to find a title for a show.

Yeah.

It's really hard.

Because everything sounds stupid until it comes out and then it just becomes the thing that it is.

I know.

But also you come up with a brilliant idea and then there's some film from 1953 and or some TV show that was made six months ago.

Right.

Or some short five minute, 10 minute short film that's going to sue you if you.

Yeah.

Exactly.

You have to make a lot of people happy.

You know, sister, sister, sister, sister, sister.

Well, sister sister sister sister sister sister.

Isn't that what I said?

You just said sister sister sister sister.

No, I said sister sister sister sister sister.

I'm checking.

I'm checking with people.

Oh, sorry.

Okay.

Because I first said because there's another show called sister sister and then I paused yeah, dramatically.

Like that's all I was going to say.

And then I went on and I said the next three.

But maybe that would be because I feel like modern family did closet closets closets closets so well.

I don't remember this, but.

Don't remember closets closets closets closets.

What is that?

So it's the name of his nemesis.

Played by whom?

I don't know.

But anyway, he sells closets and the name of his closet stories closets closets closets closets closets closets.

You a big you should do.

Okay.

Not to be the person giving you so much advice for free, but I kind of want to manage you by the way.

Why do you think I'm doing a bad job?

No, but there are areas in which we could kind of pump this off a little bit, but you should start up a modern family rewatch podcast.

They're very big right now.

The office ladies, they make so much money.

Really?

Yes.

I'm not in modern family.

No, but see, you're a big fan.

Yeah.

You're a star already.

So it's almost like this already and you know, how much would I make?

Do you like millions?

Dollars, by the way.

Sure.

Okay.

You get one of your friends.

Who else likes modern family?

Both my daughters.

Both of your daughters.

Yeah.

Okay.

Are they famous?

No, but they're funny.

Okay.

You think this is a hard sell.

Yeah.

Get another famous person.

Yeah.

Well, maybe someone who's never seen modern family.

Who's your best friend?

My best friend is Pippa Brown.

Okay.

Get Pippa.

Yeah, you and Pippa.

It's very funny.

Yeah, that could work.

You and Pippa watching modern family talking about it, interviewing all the people who are on it.

Okay.

I can give you a contract right now.

Yeah.

Well, I'm busy until 2025, but if you feel like the podcast thing is still going to be a thing, then it was something else.

I don't know if the world is still going to be around.

Something else might have come along, right?

Yeah, a new invention, man.

That's going to kill us.

Just like podcast killed radio.

When did you start doing 14 years ago?

Really?

So you must have been one of the pioneers.

I mean, I don't like to bandy that word about am I on Mount Podmore along with, you know, Obama, Springsteen, the guy who they just released from prison on from serial Adnan.

What's his name?

Oh, Adnan.

Yeah.

Sure.

I'm on there.

Is it annoying that everyone has a podcast?

Yes.

Yeah.

I'd say that without hesitation.

Yes.

It was better when I was one of the only people.

Yeah.

This is better than I know.

I feel the same.

I started a production company.

Yeah.

And now I think everyone has a production company.

No.

Yeah.

Every actor has a production company.

Yeah.

And every actor is ever cast in something.

They're also executive producing.

Oh, really?

Wow.

What a treat.

There's a lot of executive producing to do.

A lot to be done.

All right.

Well, speaking of a lot to be done, we need to get to our next guest, if that's okay.

Bad Sisters is on Apple TV+.

Right now, all 10 episodes.

Let's talk to this gentleman.

And I have my first question all lined up ready to go.

Thanks to Sharon.

By the way, you know what else you do?

You could do a Hogan family rewatch podcast.

Horgan on Hogan.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yes.

Okay.

Anyway, let's get to our next guest.

Oh, he is the owner and proprietor.

Oh, Horgan.

No, there was a sitcom, an American sitcom called the Hogan family.

I didn't know.

Okay.

I think it was called Valerie's family and then Sandy Duncan passed away.

Oh.

And not Sandy Duncan.

Anyway, they, whoever was, who played Valerie passed away.

And then they changed.

They didn't, they had a great thing going here.

So they just, they changed it to the Hogan family.

Oh.

Okay.

Anyway, let's talk to our next guest.

He is the owner and proprietor of original figs liquor.

No, he's shaking his head, but I don't remember what his store is called.

But let's talk to him right now.

Original fig is here.

Hello.

Hey Scott, how you doing?

I'm good.

How are you?

It's a Gethsemane liquor and scratch.

Gethsemane.

That's right.

Lickerns.

That's right.

And I just real quick before we get into whatever.

Do you want to correct me about the Hogan family?

Yeah.

Here's what happened.

The show was a sitcom was originally called Valerie.

She starred Valerie Harper and it was her and her family.

Then after first.

Where was Sandy Duncan during this?

Hold on a second.

Don't spoil it for yourself.

Okay.

So after the first season, I think shows big hit.

Valerie Harper says, I want this amount of money.

They said no, she said, well, then I'll quit.

They said, okay.

Was it that short of a negotiation?

Pretty much.

They kept everybody else.

They threw Sandy Duncan in there to be the aunt and they renamed it the Hogan family.

It ran for like seven years.

Wow.

What kind of lesson does that teach you about your business Sharon?

Just for so just.

Expendable, right?

Totally expandable.

Unless you're Sylvester Stallone in the Expendables franchise.

New one's coming out very soon.

Yeah.

No, I will not get out because it is coming out.

I'm scared to look at that.

He is quite shirtless in all these movies.

And all the other lads, the same lads from the first time around.

I don't really so.

Yeah.

Scared to look at that as well.

Yeah, exactly.

They keep adding people too.

Like Harrison Ford showed up in one.

He did not.

He did.

Yeah.

I forgot.

He was like, he looked like they're having fun.

How come I can't do this?

Like when Frank Sinatra wanted to be in the Cannonball Run movie.

Is Mickey work in the Expendables?

He's got to be.

He must be.

Got to be.

Do you remember by the way, Frank Sinatra in the Cannonball Run 2 in the credits, he first of all, Frank Sinatra filmed all of his scenes on a totally different day than anyone else.

That's right.

You can tell because he's sitting behind a desk and then Sammy Davis Jr. is across the desk from him and they never interact at all.

And then during the the outtakes at the end where everyone's laughing and they're the bloopers, they're having a great time.

Sammy Davis Jr. is going off and forgets his lines and says, or whatever the fuck can he's bleeped or whatever.

And then it cuts to Frank Sinatra just sitting there behind the desk on a totally different day going ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha they cut it in there trying to try to make people think that he was there.

I feel like when you manufacture a blooper that's one of the worst scenes you can commit because bloopers are sacred.

Okay, don't watch the Between Two Ferns movie then.

Why is that?

Would you fake some bloopers?

We may have faked a couple of bloopers.

But I mean if you're faking a blooper like Toy Story style, that's fine.

Right.

But I mean if you're trying to really convince people this was a blooper that happened, I don't like that.

I don't want people combing through the Between Two Ferns movie and looking for whatever blooper happens to be fake.

The Creme Dela Creme of bloopers?

Yes.

News bloopers.

Yes.

Well, you know, every, what time of year did they come out because I feel like it was in May or something?

November.

November they come out?

No, because a friend of mine and I are constantly pinged on Twitter whenever they come out because they know that we enjoy them so much.

I wonder if your friend might have muted that account.

Oh, okay, maybe.

But we don't get those.

You don't get news bloopers?

I gotta say that's too bad.

They're so good.

Sharon, nice to meet you.

My name's Original Fig.

Hey, nice to meet you too.

Scott, thanks for being with me.

I like your kervas.

Oh, thank you very much.

I don't usually do this.

Yeah.

But I thought this is a special occasion to me back in the studio.

So I thought I'd like to dress it up a bit.

Your first time, I mean I saw you on the tour this summer.

That's right.

But this is your first time back in the, first time ever being in the studio?

No, we met in the studio.

We did.

I love meeting in a studio.

I think we were sitting these exact same chairs.

Yeah, that's how Sharon and I just met in a studio.

I watched it happen.

It was incredible.

So please explain yourself to Sharon if you don't mind.

Very simply.

Yeah.

I run a liquor store called Gethsemane Lickering Scratcher.

We sell.

That's based upon the garden by the way, Gethsemane by the way, a song that Dave Finkel sang in Jesus Christ Superstar.

Wow.

That's right.

That's not religious.

That's not why I chose that name.

I'm a big fan of true crime.

So that's why I love the New Testament.

Because he's one of the original murder victims.

I feel like it's one of the earliest examples of true crime.

I cannot read the Bible without hearing.

Dung, dung.

Yeah.

Right?

Isn't that fun?

What if Lenny Briscoe was in the Bible?

That would have been great.

What if it was part of the Munch of Earth?

No one's approached there because there's been films of Bibles.

I mean, especially the big one.

Yes.

Which one are we talking about?

Well, Jesus of Nazareth and his whole demise.

Oh, I thought you meant one of the biggest films.

His whole man's wreath, everything that happened to him.

His whole 33 years of drama.

But it would be fun to shoot it sort of, you know.

Like a procedural.

Yeah.

Really.

Spira going into his.

Oh, the tension.

Even though we all know what's going to happen.

Yeah.

If you did it, if you filmed it in that, you know, you have to get the right director.

And you know.

Absolutely.

You're pitching yourself for the job.

Well, it's for him.

I like this one.

This is why I want to manage you.

Because you have that go get him out and you just spear it.

Up for anything.

Yeah.

So you own and run this liquor store.

That's right.

Which is like the hub of the neighborhood.

Everybody's there all the time.

It's where, you know, the politics gets discussed.

It's where everybody gets their news from.

And you guys do stage production.

We do stage productions there as well.

We do plays.

We've done a few musicals.

It's a repertory theater, essentially.

Kind of.

Yeah.

It's all the people in the neighborhood.

But we do get some big names coming.

Right.

Oh my God.

Who do we just have?

Marga Martindale is just in.

Really?

She's incredible.

Yeah.

She's terrific.

We did the three sisters.

Check offs three sisters.

Yeah, that's right.

Who were the other two?

It was.

Oh, this is embarrassing.

I can't believe I can't remember the name from Titanic.

She was the mom.

Kate Winslow.

Oh, a clinic.

A related to Clint Eastwood?

No.

She was not the mom.

I'm talking about the mom.

She was not the mom.

Oh, oh, Kathy Bates.

No, but she was in it too.

Oh, okay.

It was Kathy Bates.

Marga Martin.

So this is like a Titanic reunion.

And she was also on CSI.

Marga Helgen Burger.

What a cast.

Incredible.

I feel like I blocked her name out because I would say in my mind, don't say hamburger.

Because I was, I, you know, it would be harder not to say Marge.

Well, it's one of those things where no, Marga got a lock on because of Marga Reed.

Marga Reed is here.

We sell Marga Reus.

And pre-made, we sell pre-made, we sell the kits.

You sell the ingredients.

We sell the ingredients, but however.

Whatever.

How much time you got to make a Marga Reed?

Zero or all the time before we got you covered.

So I would see her as like, hey, Marg.

And I would say like, don't say.

When she walks in, we do go, Marg.

Like Norm from tears.

She wasn't there that often.

Okay.

Can I just ask a quick question?

But where did the theatrical productions take place?

They take place at the far end of the store where there's a clear area.

Do a makeshift stage with like cases of beer, sort of that one?

Yeah, we have like a nice little stage.

I mean, on top of cases of beer, yes.

But we don't have a lot of beer customers.

So that's, you know, mostly it's because a lot of hard drinkers.

A lot of hard drinkers.

We have Top Shelf Licker and Off-Brand Snacks.

And of course, Scratchers.

Yes, that's right.

And those are Top Shelf Scratchers.

Are there different types of Scratchers which are good or bad?

I mean, Scratchers are Scratchers.

They cost the same.

We do have some artistic scratches.

Scratchers.

So why are you to beat?

But we will design our own Scratchers sometimes.

Oh, you will.

Yeah, of course.

I mean, it's basically, it's just a vehicle to scratch it off with the coin and then you see which one.

Don't ever put a prize of like a million dollars in there.

Well, we don't determine the prizes.

Oh, OK.

I'm saying.

I thought you were making your own Scratchers that you were dispensing the prize.

We have a deal with a lottery commission where we can design the outside.

They determine what the prizes are.

So you get to do the outside.

They get to do the inside.

That's right.

Wow.

Yeah.

And so like we design like a La Pieda where you scratch away different parts of, you know, the figure of Christ and only mother.

Sounds like you are religious.

I swear to God, I'm not.

We do like the last supper we scratch off the heads.

All the heads.

That's where they eat.

Well, you don't scratch them all off because then, you know, you can only scratch off so many.

And if you don't win like in the third one, the fifth one, you didn't win.

Right.

OK, got it.

So who do you scratch off first?

Like is there a strategy?

Like do you go to Jesus up to the customer?

If it were me, I don't know if I'd be able to help myself from scratching off Judas first.

Get him out of here.

So this is incredible.

By the way, what production do you have going on?

When we talked to you in the tour, there was something interesting, but I bet it's closed.

Yeah, right.

That's closed by now.

I mean, I don't remember.

We got stuff coming in and out.

We're gearing up to do Danny in a deep blue sea.

Wow.

Holiday sewer coming up.

Yeah, Bradley Cooper's going to come down and do that.

And I'm really cool.

Wow.

That's amazing.

We got Bradley Cooper and then one of the people from the neighborhood.

He's so hard to get.

I mean, I couldn't even.

We caught him at the right time.

Right, right, right.

Right.

He's like, you know, he loves a theater and he's like, yeah, let me get it.

It's like a limited run.

It's only like three nights.

So for him, it's not.

That's a lot of learning for three nights, but I guess.

Absolutely.

Do you have teleprompters?

It's nice to have.

It's nice that it's three nights because then they can do a film or, you know, they can have them in a series or something.

Yeah, exactly.

That's right.

You know, I have a client who would like to maybe do something like this and you're looking at her right now.

We use your working together?

We're working together now.

I mean, I'm the impactful.

I'm the impactful.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Exactly.

Just giving it a go.

Yeah.

So no one signed nothing.

What's your role do you want to do?

Like your dream room?

What?

No.

What's your name?

What role do you want to do?

In the assistant?

No, no.

Of any play.

You can call your shot right now.

Just the older shot in the sea or something.

You want to do the old man in the sea?

Yeah, I just see.

Really?

That's the actor's dream.

A cast of one.

Even cast away had other people in it.

But old man in the sea is just you and maybe an animatronic fish.

Oh, by the way, I have a very important question.

Do I need to ask you?

Okay.

Do you own a briefcase?

Thank you.

I do.

Whoa!

Can I ask another one?

Absolutely.

Do you put your lunch in it?

Close.

You put your lunch close to your briefcase?

What I put in the briefcase is as many beef steak tomatoes as I can fit in that.

Oh, hey.

Because...

I love spaghetti sauce.

Sure.

I love to make it in front of other people.

Right.

Okay.

So, just you carrying the briefcase to work, does it turn into spaghetti sauce?

No, I have to make it.

Oh, once you get to the place.

It's not a magic briefcase, just regular.

Just the sloshing around, I would just put some pepper in there.

Well, do you think I'm running everywhere?

You don't know what you do.

Also, do you think...

Do you think...

Just...

Jocelyn tomatoes...

I don't know!

...turns them into...

No, fig!

I don't know what your lifestyle is.

Scott, Scott.

We like each other.

Okay, we are for it.

I'm not managing you.

I'm not trying to make fun of you.

No, no.

Okay.

Well, this is incredible.

So, the holidays are coming up.

The holidays...

Let me tell you why I'm here.

Yeah.

And I appreciate you letting me come back on.

Oh, yeah?

Because we saw each other...

My pleasure.

...on your tour.

What city were we in?

I don't remember.

And here's why.

I was in...

I had some health problems.

And that's why I didn't sound like myself.

No!

Yeah.

Just after the show.

When you were listening to back?

I was listening back.

Did that clue you in that you had health problems?

Actually, you know what?

I realized it.

I realized it towards the end of that show.

I was like, oh, I don't sound like me.

And here's what happened is that...

And I had to change policy at the store.

People were scratching off so many scratchers in front of me.

I inhaled too much at a dust.

No, too much at a silver dust.

What was that made of?

As best as...

The doctor says it's a combination of...

Glue, silver glitter, and fluoride.

No, fluoride!

I can't get it in your throat.

And of course, I don't have a protective flap of my throat anymore.

No!

Because I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid.

Oh, is the UVula protective flap?

No.

What does it do?

It's the guy.

See, you can have vibrato.

One of the only body parts made just for singing.

It's only function.

Wow.

So you were...

You listened to yourself back and you said, I need to get to a doctor.

I'm not going to a doctor.

So they...

All clear now?

They cleaned me out.

How do they do?

They put a big toilet brush down there?

What do they do?

Kind of.

I mean, you're not far off.

It is like a tool that...

You know how you have those...

Like if you want to clean it inside of a bottle, you got one of those long things.

Pipe cleaner.

Yeah.

But that's exactly what they call it.

Pipe cleaner, yeah, because it cleans pipes.

Right.

Yeah.

And so...

But we think when you hear it, we're a pipe cleaner, you think of arts and crafts.

Yeah, exactly.

Because no one ever cleans pipes.

No.

We pay people to clean pipes.

But this is like a long handled brush that sort of looks like a toilet brush, but of course, the bristles are smaller because it's not going in the mouth of the toilet.

As I call it, I don't know what you call it, but I call it the mouth of the toilet.

Are we talking about a body part right now?

I call it the neck of the toilet.

I know that makes more sense, but I still think of it as a mouth.

It says a big mouth, a toilet.

Yeah.

That's just going...

That's the nice way to figure it out.

It should be the toilet throat, of course.

That's the toilet.

I think of it as the mouth of the toilet.

Did that hurt?

It hurt a lot.

Are you under general on the side?

I was in the twilight sleep to give you propofol.

Nice.

And I could see everything that was going on.

You wouldn't see it.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I was not wide awake, but I was kind of awake.

I thought it was hilarious.

But when they put it in, they showed it to me.

They said, we're going to put this in your throat and move it around.

And I said, all right, I feel like a doctor was taking a little bit of advantage of me, because the way he was talking to me was not very doctorally.

You know what I mean?

He's like, see this?

See this?

I'm going to stick it in your throat and move it around.

He was like, taunting you.

It was, yeah.

And I was like, yeah, I know.

That's why I'm here.

And then he said, I'm fucking with you.

And then we both had a good laugh.

Fucking with you.

You had something you don't want your doctor to say.

We both had a good laugh.

And here's what they, so instead of that, what they did was it's basically a fireplace bellows.

And they just like, like blew it into my throat.

What?

Like, like one of those things that you see Bert from Mary Poppins have, doesn't he have one of those or do the chimney sweep?

He should.

I mean, he was a chimney sweep.

Bert should have like a utility belt, like Batman, shouldn't he?

Even that I bet they didn't get a hold of the glacier.

No, there's still some in there.

And I can see it, you know, when I brush my teeth.

Well, also, as you've been talking, there's just been a steady cloud coming out of glaze.

Oh, no.

It looks lovely.

Well, but, you know, breathe shallow breaths, everybody.

Okay.

You don't want this there.

That's not good.

Oh, no.

So why are you here?

You just wanted to clear that up because I, if anybody was wondering, and I don't, it's not like anyone said anything.

I never heard anything about it.

But yeah, I just want people to know that this is what I sound like.

This is what you said.

Yes, I'm sorry I didn't sound like myself on a tour.

It's quite all right.

I didn't notice.

So I mean, we've only met maybe three times at this point.

I think so.

This might be our fourth time.

Yeah, it might be our fourth time.

So, you know, I wasn't really keeping track of how you sound from appearance to appearance.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But we got some new, also little plug.

We got some new snacks in the store.

Really?

Now, you know, Sharon very into this.

I like this.

I love, I really love snacks.

You do.

What's your favorite snack?

Well, any kind of, well, you call it chips.

We say crisps.

Of course, yes.

Any, any kind of.

That's the basic lift and elevator.

I know, I know those.

Yeah, any kind of crisp.

And then I like jerky.

Jerky, really?

Yeah.

Okay, like a meat jerky?

Any meat or fish?

A spicy or a spicy jerky.

But a spice, oh, my jerky.

I don't know that fish jerky is popular here in the States.

Yeah.

That's so crazy.

Massive, really?

Really?

Massive.

It's always interesting when you go to another country and you just look at the disgusting things they eat.

I just, well, we went to Canada on the tour and we were in Detroit one second and then in Canada and we went to a liquor store.

The second we got into Canada, just the grossest shit.

What do you, what do you see?

I mean, just the crisps, flavors and...

How are they gross?

I don't know.

Just, you know, like flavor combinations.

They were different?

They were, yes, I mean.

I think things that are different.

So the new snacks, what do you got?

Yeah, you know, we got all the snacks or they look sort of like the snacks you know, but they're off-brand.

And yes, we passed the savings on to you.

You keep some of the savings though.

Yeah, some of them.

Yeah, well, I mean, I make a profit on them.

Yeah.

And I'll make the exact same profit that you would if they were regular snacks.

Here's what it is.

You get a bigger profit.

I, of course, I'll make a profit.

Yeah.

Let's break down the phrase and we pass the savings on to you.

I'm saving money.

Yes.

By buying these off-brand snacks.

Right.

Then I'm selling them to you at a reduced price.

Well, my point is say there's a bag of chips that are $5 that are lays.

Right.

And you buy them for- You know what?

Are you telling me you don't like greys?

That's your reversing grades.

Yeah.

Are the chips gray?

The chips are not gray per se, but the bag is gray.

It's gray.

Okay.

But say you buy a lay.

There's no move.

I got to say, and I think it is the packaging.

It is the title as well.

Yeah.

I buy lays for $2 and sell them for $5.

Right.

Ridiculous.

I would never do it.

Why?

All right.

Free out.

You know what I mean?

You can do it.

No, I didn't mean to shut you down.

If I was involved in your business, I know very little about you.

This is a good side hustle for you.

I want to encourage you as your manager.

Yeah.

If it's- Have you bought your bulk bought greys?

Yeah.

Okay.

You got a lot and you're not shifting them.

Tons.

If that feels like the kind of place it is anyway, just like put some bowls of gray out.

I can't see- Do you know what Sharon?

I like that.

Yeah.

And I think I would also put them in a gray bowl.

Also half time, I think it's called half time between the first bit of the play and the second bit of the play.

It depends on the sport.

Yeah.

I believe that's the case for basketball and football.

That's right.

Not for baseball.

Although they have the seventh inning stretch.

That's right.

Take me out to the ball game.

Take me.

It's a song we sing.

Yeah.

The seventh.

Because baseball has nine innings, the seventh inning in between.

They know that the game should end out at seven.

Everyone agrees.

Baseball is way too long.

Nothing happens.

And they go, look, this should be over.

That's the beauty of it.

This should be over.

But instead we're going to get everyone up on their feet, sing a dumb song, and that'll at least like get the blood rushing beer.

You've been sitting for hours.

I mean, it's like seven hours at this point.

And then you get up and you get to sing a song.

But here's why baseball is a great sport.

You can get so much done while you're watching a baseball game.

That's right.

And it doesn't matter if you're at home, if you're at the stadium, you can multitask like nobody's business.

You can make deals.

Yeah.

You can be rolling calls.

Absolutely.

All right.

So what's the name of snack you like?

And I'll tell you.

Okay.

We have this just as good, but for a lower price.

Okay.

M&Ms.

M&Ms?

Do you like O&Os?

Oh, you know, it's one of the O's stand for.

I guess O.

What did the M&M stand for?

Mars and Murray, my good fellow.

Right.

So this should be the makers.

It's pro makers of a candy snack.

Like, were you singing that to the tune of owner of the William?

Of course.

Yes.

Okay.

O&Os.

Do you have another favorite?

Are just like M&Ms except, and they taste exactly the same, except the shell is on the inside and the chocolate's on the outside.

What?

The melty part?

Melty on the outside?

Not in your mouth.

Okay.

Do you have another favorite snack here?

Like a skull check.

Is it a snack?

A snack.

Can you do that?

We do.

Can you do that?

We have a thing called a Welsh egg, which is essentially a drag.

It's like an ostrich egg that is pickled and brined and it looks like a dragon's egg because of the Welsh flag.

Wow.

So it's a gigantic, pickled and brined egg.

But it's covered in not sausage.

No, it's covered in wrinkles.

It looks like scales.

Okay.

And it's covered in fish scales.

Gigantic egg must cost...

It's $5.

It's only $5.

That's a steal.

It's the last.

I don't believe that's a real ostrich egg.

It is.

Well, I mean, look.

Do you...

Is there an ostrich from?

All ostriches are not created equal.

Wow.

Okay.

Wow.

So it's not premium ostrich.

Okay.

So it's off-brand ostrich, almost.

It's off-brand ostrich.

It's an emu.

Ostrich jerky, my... as a side, you know, hustle.

Yeah.

It was like as long as one of those legs.

I had a friend, by the way, whose father was obsessed.

Like a Disneyland, you could tell.

This friend's father was obsessed with emus and he was saying it was the meat of the future.

What?

And he was gonna start a farm because he's like, everyone's gonna be eating them.

They weren't gonna transition out of beef.

How long ago was this?

This is 25 years or so ago.

Wow.

It still could be.

What did he say?

The future's not here yet.

What's the flavor?

Why does it taste like the meat of the future?

I guess, well, there was a point where there was a burger place down the street from here that was selling ostrich burgers that was trying to get that going.

I remember.

And they were like, it was leaner.

You know the place.

And it was leaner and it's like...

Leaner.

...meener.

...greener.

Yeah.

Do you have another favorite snack?

Twizzlers.

Big debate.

Twizzlers versus red vines.

Yeah.

People are divided on this.

Twizzlers is more fun.

It's more fun to say.

Yeah.

Red vines though.

Very fanciful idea.

That's true.

I mean, Tarzan, he swings on green vines.

Can you imagine if he's small or red vines?

Can you imagine Tarzan?

He's swinging around.

He's saying hi to the apes.

Suddenly he grabs a vine and it's like red and he's like going, he sticks in his mouth and he's like, I could get used to this.

Okay.

So if you like Twizzlers.

Love them.

We got you caught.

Fraslers.

Yes.

They're both Fraslers.

It tastes just like Twizzlers but the bag is very hard to open.

Sounds like Twizzlers.

Do you have our hard time?

I have our hard time.

Yeah.

I have arthritis though.

Oh no, I'm so sorry.

Oh, I'm sorry too.

Have you tried buffering?

Oh no.

I got a trend.

Do you have operant buffering by the way?

No, we just got buffering.

Oh, okay.

Buffering feels like an upgrade.

Integrate aspirin wars of the 80s.

Yeah.

Well, Fig, it's great to have you here.

Oh, we're done with me, okay.

We are done with you but I got that briefcase question which covered that.

Can you stick around?

It'd be nice to...

I stick around with you.

Yeah, we have a comedian on next.

Do you like comedy?

Love comedy.

Who's your favorite comedian?

Probably Shakespeare.

Someone nice dream.

He's the original.

Nothing funnier.

Nothing better than...

I haven't seen anything funnier since the first time I saw Midsummer Night's Dream.

Oh, so funny.

Funniest thing I've ever seen.

So good.

All right, well, we have a comedian coming up and we have the great Sharon Horgan is here and original Fig.

We're going to come right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Green sticks.

That's the red vines off, friend.

Thank you.

Comedy bang bang we're back.

Sharon Horgan is here.

Bad sisters.

The worst sisters.

They're good sisters, really.

They're good as sisters, but they're bad in terms of the laws view on their actions.

True, and they're about murder.

That's true.

But yeah.

Do you want to pitch on a sequel on a second?

Well, I'm just thinking like, because they are good sisters, but it's called bad sisters.

That's like if, you know, John Wayne Gacy's bad son.

Yeah.

Like he's somebody's son.

Or like, Dahmer was like, good-mer.

What?

I don't know.

But it'd be weird.

You got to admit that.

If they call Dahmer good-mer, it would be weird.

Agreed.

I mean, look.

But that is another show.

I mean, I feel like it's a very friendly name for a sitcom character.

It is.

It sounds like Kramer almost.

Yeah, it just works at a zoo.

And things aren't great at home.

Things are great at the zoo.

Great at the zoo.

All right.

Well, we need to get to our next guest.

Oh, boy.

We met him in Minneapolis, Minnesota on the tour, the first night of the tour.

He came out and he entertained the crowd.

You like comedy, by the way, Sharon?

No.

Good.

All right.

You can tune out for this segment then.

Here he is.

He's back.

Please welcome back Weed Seinfeld.

What's the deal with Weed?

I mean, why do we call this stuff Weed?

It should be fun.

I think we should call it weed.

Like my ex-wife used to say, get that D out of here.

All right.

Weed Seinfeld is here.

Did you, is that a new joke or?

Yeah, that's my new one.

I write a two, one new one every time.

Well, we only had two jokes to begin with on the last time we saw you.

So I didn't, well, I thought I didn't know I had a second one.

Yeah.

I tell you what, I came up with a good one.

Yeah, I came up with one.

I crushed one weed when we saw it.

I've been touring all around for you.

If you don't know, my brother, Jerry Seinfeld, very famous comedian.

Perhaps you know of him.

He saw a guy walking down the street with a hard hat at eight in the morning.

He said, that guy goes and writes jokes every day.

I'm going to go do that.

And I said, not me.

Tell me you're famous.

I'm going to use your name and try to get famous myself.

So that's what I'm doing.

What story is this?

He saw a guy with a hard hat and he said, that guy writes jokes every day?

What?

I was asleep.

I didn't exactly tell him.

That's what I imagined.

I think it was that Seinfeld likened it to that job where you would go and do it every day.

Yeah, he didn't think the guy wearing the hard hat was writing jokes every day.

It was a funny hat.

Oh, guy with a funny hat.

He must have gone and write funny jokes.

See, I think you have your brother's story totally wrong.

That's all I heard it.

So that not, you got famous enough.

I took his last name.

It's my last name to it and take a spell.

But put something popular in front of it.

I'm not going to make money.

When did you start doing?

Is it stand up comedy you do or just?

It is.

I go and tell jokes.

It's what my brother does.

So I've tried to do the same thing.

The hard thing is I usually do terrible.

Yours was the first show I've ever done well at.

You did really, really well.

I think you had us propping you up.

Yeah.

That's a big part.

Maybe encouraging you to write a second joke.

That was a big part of it.

Perhaps maybe that's why my mother said don't go so well.

I've been to an all these colleges.

No one laughs at anything I say.

What was the first joke?

The last time?

Yeah.

What was the one you came up with?

What's the deal with weed?

Very similar to the joke you just wrote.

Why do they call this stuff weed?

A weed is an unwanted plant.

I'm paying 40 bucks for it.

I want it.

Good.

Great stuff.

But then you ended.

Well, yeah, of course.

Then you sat down.

I'm not saying thank you very much.

The second joke is the same premise, right?

Yeah, starts the same.

Why is it called weed?

What's the deal with weed?

Okay, bye.

What's the deal with with bomb rips?

Huh?

Here we go.

Why are we ripping?

Bongs.

That's a fun activity.

We should call them bong hugs.

I want to be hugging this stuff.

Ah.

So anyway, you guys are dying.

I'm crushing in here.

Don't we can tell?

I go play these colleges.

No one's laughing and I don't get it.

Yeah.

Because you had such.

Yeah, sorry.

No, I'm just.

No, no, no.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

You go.

Okay, on three, let's all talk at the same time.

Okay.

Three, two, one.

So why are you really bad?

I'm wondering why you still do it as a job because I...

Okay.

I heard one of those.

I heard my feelings.

But I will respond because I guess the reason I'm doing it is because I'm trying to make money off my brother's name.

Right.

You know?

And so if you want some famous architect, architect stuff.

You know?

But how do you survive?

How do you make?

Because I can't imagine you get too many bookings or do you?

Yeah.

Oh, you get the initial bookings.

Yeah.

You get the...

You see weed, Seinfeld's coming to your college.

Well, kids love weed.

Yeah.

And you get paid up front.

You get paid up front.

So even if you're never asked back.

But that's happening.

But again, I cannot tell you how well it went with you.

And so I figured I got to come back here.

I got to get with the Scott man.

I got to get hooked up because these kids, the only reason I could tell they're not laughing at my jokes, cancel culture.

It's got to be cancel culture, right?

I don't know about cancel culture.

I'm a 70 year old man.

Challenge jokes.

I forgot that aspect, W.E.R. 7.

I'm older.

I'm his older brother.

Yeah.

I'm his older brother.

Older, less cool.

Well, up for the bench.

You see those pictures of him recently?

Very cool.

I thought...

Did you do anything before you got into comedy?

Lots of...

Oh, yeah.

I tried...

Whatever he was trying, I tried.

You know?

Pretty early, he really liked it.

Yeah, if he was an architect named Jerry Seinfeld, right?

Did you call yourself architecture Seinfeld?

Oh, no, I think I'd stick with weed.

It's a popular thing that I think people like talking about right now.

Okay.

Hey, you're something.

What's the deal with weed?

It's so popular, right?

You're training into Jay Leno, so you're sorry.

Here's something, by the way.

Okay.

All right.

Then I'll stick to what I know.

What's the deal with weed?

It's so popular.

CBD is making money.

That's crazy.

People are selling CBD.

That'd be like, if beer got popular, people started selling barley.

I don't see that happening.

This is a good joke.

That's weird.

I haven't even did.

This is not bad.

Did you do this for that one?

Yeah.

Okay.

I'll start with that one.

Then why do we call it pot?

Oh, what's the deal with pot?

So you're back to why do we call things thing?

I really liked the CBD one because it got into...

Why do you call things this?

It's pretty service level.

All right.

I'll mix it up.

What's the deal with these weed stores?

Yeah, here we go.

This is yours.

I'll go into what it looks like an Apple store.

Huh?

I'm not trying to buy a MacBook Pro.

I'm trying to get high, bro.

What's the deal with that store?

All this information in there, they got all the numbers.

They got percentages.

150% of this, 87% of that.

Well, what's going on?

This is a weed store or chemistry class.

You sound like you're in distress.

I'm not doing well.

You sound like someone shaking you.

Let me tell you, I'm living in the throat of a toilet and I'm eating oats and grays.

Can't stop.

I got booked on a bunch of colleges.

I did great and now no one's booking me so I'm hanging out and the door opened and I came in here.

Well, it's good to have you.

I mean, you're one of my favorite comedians of all time.

Oh, thank you.

Well, when I hate comedy.

Oh, great.

So, yeah.

I'm about one for four, I'd say, today.

You did like one.

I liked two.

I liked the one you started with, too.

OK.

I could continue on.

Do you write?

When is your process?

No.

It seems, hey, this is part of your issue.

You come in with one joke and then you write in the room.

Right.

Only at our urging.

Well, here's maybe what you don't understand about me.

I don't want to work hard.

I just want money given to me.

Right?

So that's kind of the life I'm living.

When you're a Duneys college shoes and you're talking about being canceled because of culture.

Right.

Yeah.

That'll not happen.

How long of a set would you do before you got off stage?

I do my first joke.

I sit down.

Ready for questions?

Questions.

That's what this thing went.

This went great.

These kids.

That's a mark of a good comedy show.

A long Q&A.

Well, I watch.

I watch what's on TikTok now.

It's all people interviewing the audience anyway.

Yeah.

I don't even got to be funny.

Kids don't even have to laugh.

I can put captions down below and say whatever.

I can just say they're, I'm still crushing.

So how did you see you felt like people weren't laughing because of counterculture?

Cancel.

Cancel culture.

So counterculture.

That's a different problem.

When you sit down for questions.

Would you get any questions or?

Yeah.

Why don't you stop?

We're here for a comedy show.

Why did you not continue?

Did people, did they laugh at the first joke?

Not, not many.

Not many.

But some.

Some the setup.

Some, some, some.

They laughed at the setup.

One thing people in the back probably thought I might have actually been Jerry Seinfeld.

Oh.

Because it's a similar setup.

Do you think it was a tie far back where they say?

We found pretty far back.

I'm trying to pack.

So out of the ear shot even.

Yeah.

Well, some people think we sound a little similar.

But you're considerably taller than Jerry Seinfeld.

Very much taller.

Yeah.

I'm too Jerry stacked on top of each other.

It's made it hard.

Can I ask another question?

I love it.

I'm not going to make a video.

I'm going to make a video.

Do you have your business?

I did.

I saw a B movie and I was like, I got to knock it off.

You're mainly interested in doing off-brand anything then.

Well, it's more, I just want to make it easier for people.

You want to pass the same thing.

Lickers considered.

Lickers is a full price.

It's marked up like you wouldn't believe.

I do, but snacks are like everybody loves snacks.

Everybody loves the movies.

I was like, well, what if there was a movie for kids that I could do?

That I could sell to parents at a way reduced rate because these kids watch these movies over and over again.

Of course.

What's a lot of worm film, if you don't mind me asking?

Well, humans find out that worms can talk to each other.

Oh, no.

So this is like a horror.

The first act is the day they find out worms can talk to each other.

The first minute.

Really.

So there's no small talk.

Is that, does that say a little bit?

The movie, Seven Minutes Home.

Oh, okay.

The movie or?

Close.

It sounds just close enough.

Just says enough, guys.

Is there a strange HIV joke in your film as well?

Just like the movie?

There's a few.

I wouldn't call them strange.

All right.

This sounds right at my alley.

Yeah.

I love it.

Let's do it.

Seven Minutes Script.

That's something I'll read.

So when you said Seven Minutes?

Yeah, Seven Minutes.

All right.

That's about my attention span.

Great.

I will send you the two pages later today.

All right.

Look at this.

See, this is why you got one.

It's seven minutes, but it's only two pages.

Are these like packed with exposition?

There's a lot of exposition.

There's a lot of like, you get the idea.

Like we're all right.

You'll go do the worms.

Et cetera.

The worms look at each other and give each other a ry smile.

You get the idea.

Right.

And then we're at a different place.

Also very tiny font.

Right?

Very tiny font.

Are you at a one point?

I use Bookman.

Bookman.

Old at two.

Two.

Wow.

Nice.

No old.

Oh man.

It's got to be hard to read.

I would think.

It's actually easier than you think.

It's a seraphant.

So you can really tell the difference between the letters.

How long do you think you could get away with just doing regular emails with Calypso?

How long could I get away with it?

Before someone said, you know, let's go back to Ariel times New Roman.

Oh, so I'm writing my emails.

Yeah.

I'm just 10 minutes.

I'm emailing back and forth all day long.

Really?

You're just sending out emails, receiving them.

Staying them.

Receiving them.

I went to love baseball.

Okay.

So you got to fill your time.

Get a lot done.

And I'll leave my notifications on.

So people next to me, they hate the noise.

But after a while, it becomes like a little song.

Yeah.

Do it.

Have the baseball players ever?

I feel like we're cutting into weeds time.

Well, you know what?

We're almost out of time.

Oh, no.

I feel like I got to win you over.

I'll give you an opportunity to do one last thing.

All right.

Oh, it's got to be a joke.

I think so.

I'm like, let's dig into it.

I don't know.

But I get ready for it.

Okay.

Well, what's the deal with all these strains?

Huh?

Well, we got all these weeds strains.

Why do we call this stuff strain?

I'm trying to relax.

I'm not trying to strain.

We should call this weed chill.

Huh?

Okay.

Oh, she smiled and not a politely.

I'll take it.

I got to give you one note.

Okay.

Is that the word strain will always make me think of those billboards for that TV show called The Strain where they showed a worm coming out of an eyeball.

Do you think that's a common note?

That was the promo for the show.

Yeah.

But you, again, you were making worm film.

So you were kind of attuned to any competing worm project.

Well, that's true.

I worm from the brain.

The worms in your brain.

And they put me under profile and then they took them out.

But I feel like it will conjure up memories of that billboard.

People get angry.

You think other people will remember with that?

I think most people would remember it.

All right.

One note.

You got a note?

I'm not last joke.

Oh, anything.

Yeah.

No, my life.

I think, I mean, I think you should give up.

Okay.

Or.

As your manager, what if you both went on tour together?

Sharon, you could do the front half of the show.

Yeah.

And you know, you could do the stuff that you did, you know, when you were coming up, you know, and then.

I think I'm going to be busy doing my one woman show, right at figs.

Hopefully if we can make a deal, work there with the old man.

Sharon, we'd love to have you do.

We've never done a stage version of old man in the sea.

I don't know that anyone has.

Or anyone should.

Or our stage is yours.

We'll figure it out.

New Year's Day.

Anytime.

I've been looking for an opportunity to flood the store.

What?

I would do it.

I wanted to do Waterworld for a long time.

The Waterworld The Stone Show.

Yeah.

It was like, oh, I want to do that.

Yeah.

It's a good one.

All right.

Well, we are running out of time, guys.

I'm sorry, we time felt to give you such short trips.

I feel like you deserve it.

Why do you drive on a parkway, but park on the grass?

I'm trying to get high.

Pass that weed over here.

All right.

We only have time for one final feature.

And that is, of course, a little something called Plugs.

Every guest has their plug.

Just like every host has their plug back.

Just like every cowboy kills a frank in Stein.

Every guest has their plug.

Oh, beautiful.

That was, every guest has their plug by Anna Mack.

Anna Mack, thank you, Anna Mack.

That was gorgeous.

What do we want to plug, Sharon?

Obviously, we have Bat Sisters on Apple TV Plus.

Yeah.

And what else is coming down the pipeline?

Oh, um, uh, uh.

People should catch up on your old shows.

Catastrophe is fantastic.

Yeah.

Catch up on the old shows.

Uh, Game Night.

Yeah, watch Game Night again.

That's a great film.

What's a terrible way of mass talent again?

Yeah.

Do that.

Sure.

Um.

But there's got to be something on the horizon.

Oh, on the horizon.

Yeah.

Um, yeah, but it's not out for a while.

I feel really about plugging something.

What's the platform?

Um, I, I, you know, like BBC.

BBC?

Okay.

Yeah.

All right.

I'm sorry.

I'd love to just turn on the BBC.

Yeah.

Leave it on.

You'll show up eventually.

Exactly.

That's exactly what's going to happen.

Fantastic.

But watch Bad Sisters.

All 10 episodes out right now.

And, uh, if you're lucky, you could be watching the same one that I watch at the same time as me because I'm going to be watching four through 10 very soon.

So, But she'll just went down West Point.

What a freaky scenario.

Isn't that crazy?

You're watching at the same exact time that somebody else that you are listening to on a podcast.

That'd be so crazy.

Uh, fig, what do you want to plug here?

Um, I just want to let people know that this is what I sound like.

Good.

And I don't sound like what I sounded like before.

Right.

Okay.

Good.

Any shows coming up that you're interested in going to see?

I mean, obviously, for Iotope, y'all will have already, uh, elapsed.

That's right.

Yeah.

I was looking to see that show.

Um, I'm going to say if you're in, in the New York area.

Yeah.

I think it's the, uh, the 18th and the 19th of December of November, November, uh, a variety of Tope at the Bell House.

Yes.

All weekend.

It's going to be good.

Yeah.

People should go to that.

Also, are you not, uh, going to be in New York?

Are you, are you now or will you ever be in New York in December?

Um, what am I?

I don't know.

I'll talk to you about it later.

I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.

Yeah.

Hey, that's all right.

Hey, we like each other.

We like each other.

We're friends.

Uh, we've signed, what do you want to plug?

I got booked for one more show.

Uh, Holy shit, improv.

Uh, if you've ever done it's a weekly show in Los Angeles.

Uh, great comedians.

All of your favorite comedy bang bang regulars have performed there.

Uh, checking out Holy shit, improv, uh, on Instagram and you can watch any past show featuring the likes of Lauren Lapka's Big Grande, Carl Thord, anyone, uh, at, uh, patreon.com slash holy shit, improv.

All right.

You should also come see a, a, a, a, a, a store.

We got a god damn it scripted.

Okay.

That's an off brand version of Holy shit.

Well, we just do transcripts of Holy shit and pran.

Who's, who's doing the transcripts?

The same people who did the over.

I'll never tell.

Oh, the Brittany Murphy.

Um, all right.

I want to play first of all the comedy bang, bang, book coming out in April guys.

Okay.

Here's what happened.

All of the sign copies sold out.

It's such, you guys are going to make it rockets number one on the bestseller list.

I truly believe that because they all sold out within the first day.

So then I did the dumb thing where I said to the publisher, okay, I'll sign as many copies as anyone wants to buy.

And so they just now are basically selling just as many as you want to buy.

So it's going to be 10,000, 20,000 that I have to sign.

I don't know.

I have no idea.

Why would you do that?

Because I want to get, I feel bad that people are not going to get a sign copy.

How long does it take to sign 10,000?

I don't know.

Do you get really sloppy at the end?

Are you just like doing an house?

Let's see.

During the tour, we signed about two, many 500 posters.

And I think by the end, yeah, it got pretty sloppy.

Is that how you got your arthritis?

Yes, that is.

Are you worried that if people have your signature, they'll steal your identity?

Yeah, I'm very worried about that because I also write down my birthday, my first pet's name.

Should do that.

Yeah, I know.

But if you want to order one, you can get them from Barnes and Noble and also from Indigo up in Canada.

Go to CBBworld.com.

Book for that.

And then here's an interesting announcement about the tour that we've been talking about.

Okay, so if you went to the VIP, a Q&A beforehand, we took a picture and we said we had no idea how we were getting this to you.

And my agent had said, oh, yeah, there's a website that you need to upload those to you.

He finally got back to me and said, I have no idea.

Just put them up on your own website.

So go to CBBworld.com slash VIP photos.

And you can see weird awkward photos of Paul of Tomkins and myself standing in front of 23 different crowds.

And a free book?

No, not a free book.

All right, let's close up the old plug bag.

Take one hand, put it up.

Oh, no.

Open up the plug bag.

When you open up the plug bag, you open up your heart.

Close it, but don't close it.

Open up, open up, open up.

Oh, no.

Ooh, that was great.

That was plug is the word by King Love Duck Electricity.

Thank you, King Love Duck Electricity.

Wonderful remix.

Boy, such great remixes this year.

We're going to have to vote on your favorite ones at the end of the year, I think, for the poll.

Guys, I want to thank you so much.

First of all, Sharon.

So wonderful to meet you.

Big fan of your work.

And I hope that next thing that comes out on BBC, I can't wait for it.

I'm going to finish this thing first.

But man, I hope you had a good time.

I had a great time.

Thank you.

And are you going to be in and out of the Christie?

Just tell us.

Yeah.

Is that the Kenneth Ronna thing?

No, it's not.

No.

He didn't see you in this murder.

He's going to be in a frost.

I wish I'd have been asked, at least asked.

I know.

Well, tell you what, are you going to be the new Inspector Morse?

Tell you what, I'll write to you on Tuesday.

Okay.

We'll hammer out the agreement.

I'm the new Doctor Who.

You're in the new, or you are the new Doctor.

You're Doctor Why?

I'm Doctor When.

I'll write to you on Tuesday.

We'll hammer out the agreement between us.

Yeah, that'd be great.

I only take 75% or so off.

I can't remember the idea now, but...

Well, I'm your manager.

Oh, okay, so sorry.

Yeah.

We'll get you in these murder films.

We'll get you in Doctor or whatever.

Give me a book deal.

Get you the book deal.

I'll get you anything.

Get me on the student circuit.

When we time-felt, we'll team you up.

Well, I love it.

We'll get you.

I love it.

Sorry.

Frank, you're here.

Yeah, my voice.

Yeah, what happened?

We're out in the little room.

You don't sound like you anymore.

Yeah, it went somewhere.

But I'm back, baby.

All right.

And Fig, great to see you.

Good to see you, Scott.

We're friends.

We like each other.

We're friends we like each other.

And you, the listener, we're friends we like each other.

We'll see you next time.

Bye.
