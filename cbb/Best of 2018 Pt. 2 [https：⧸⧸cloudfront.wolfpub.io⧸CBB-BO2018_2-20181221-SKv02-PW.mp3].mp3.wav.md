They're, I mean, the wax is fake They're shaped like candles The light is fake They appear to be gay They appear, but they're- The wax is fake, the light is fake And thus I speak The candle's fake You gotta do Shakespeare by man You were born for Gotta do it What about like the Tempest?

Do you want to play, or no, King Lear?

What about King Lear?

That'd be fun You gotta pick somebody up Picks Oh, oh, oh, I thought you meant like on the way to rehearsals Yeah, you had a carpool All those three daughters You gotta pick them up every day Yeah, it doesn't sound fun to me It's where the Shakespeare wrote that into Whoever plays the Mad King Is he the Mad King?

He must just carpool with his daughters Or else my curse is upon you Shakespeare curse No, not the Macbeth one That's you guys That was not me Not the Wandering Jukeers Oh, Wandering Wandering Wandering Jukeers Wandering Jukeers to me Wow You should play Shakespeare I think that would be fun Like you, we should for fun Maybe do a reading of a Shakespeare thing one night That would be fun, right?

Maybe one of his comedies or something My fears that I would be absolutely terrible at it I think all we would have to do is study it for months and months No, sounds good And work with acting coaches We're doing this for free, right?

Oh, of course I think it would be fun I did Midsummer Nightstream when I was in college And that was a lot of fun And I did Romeo monologues Banished Oh, no, what did he want?

Banished?

He, I believe Romeo is Banished himself Oh, he got banished He was complaining about it That's what Shakespeare is Is like people complaining about things Romeo going banished and he kicks a rock Banished Is it Romeo or is it another dude?

No, Romeo and Hamlet confused Well, they're different They are different people, right?

They're not even in the same movie Oh, man, what an amazing movie to have the whole Shakespeare extended universe All those characters together The Avengers of Shakespeare The SCU, to have like, if they did like a Justice League or a Avengers Oh my god, that would be amazing With Shakespeare characters You just have like Lady Macbeth Yeah, just totally, you know The powers of persuasion Out brief candle To the last syllable of recorded time, is that her?

I know she's out damn spot for sure Out damn spot, that's what I meant What is the brief candle?

Time, what is it?

Blah blah blah blah To the last syllable of recorded time I used to know all these things Blah blah blah to the Wait, if we could do that, then I'm in for the Shakespeare thing My old teacher had a Wonderful expression he coined called Bard-libbing Which was only about those Yes, if you're ever on stage And you can't remember your next line You just say things like For sooth Yeah How does one And just kind of like ramble on it Anything I can't imagine All the gates of heaven Ooped for me It sounds good Until you can finally remember it I would like to do that I would love to do like a mashup or a Hulk smashup Hulk mashup of all these Shakespeare things And you know, just like All these Shakespeare things You're a big Blink-182 I love them!

Scored by the music of Blink-182 A Shakespeare Avengers!

Shakespeare Avengers scored By the music of Blink-182 Blink-183-183 What?

A weird night at the theater that would be But goddamn it, we couldn't pull it on How do I make it happen?

I think that would be a lot of fun to do There, I have several Several one night only things that I want to do Of course, there's our Little Shop of Horrors Of course there is That we've been Threatening people that we're going to do A night after years And then there's the Rocky vs. Rambo stage rating Oh yeah, why hasn't that happened?

Well, I want to get Stallone involved I want to get Stallone to read one of the parts Is that what's holding it up?

Yes, honestly Okay, I want to get it to you Are you ever prepared to let that go or Is that my one condition?

Is it a prank condition?

Okay No, it's just the time of doing it I would love it if Stallone would do it If we did it for Charity and He were to do it and maybe Nick Croll does the other Does either Rocky or Rambo?

I mean he seems to have a Terrific sense of humor about himself And a terrific sense of humor in general He probably does Probably I think it would be fun Those are my top three Charity one night only events that I want to do Is Rocky vs. Rambo, Little Shop of Horrors And the Shakespeare Avengers score by the music of Blink-182 And If someone else can be in charge of any of these I'll show up Who's in Who's in the Shakespeare Avengers?

Lady Macbeth Polonius Hamlet So you were taking like Rosen Grant's Guildenstern?

No, come on The real Avengers?

Are we going to do this?

Okay, okay, okay. You got to have Hamlet Got to have Hamlet You got to have Romeo and Juliet Yes You got to have King Lear Yeah I think Lady Macbeth over Macbeth Yeah, you're probably right Lady Macbeth You got to have Bottom Yes, that's a famous power bottom Ebenezer Scrooge Throw him in there Throw him in there Ha ha ha I like this a lot That's a good 7 Wait, who does update?

Who does update?

Yeah Colin Jost?

Colin Jost, yeah No!

Colin Jost didn't I don't want him in there Alright, I like Colin He's fine, but Come on Big Bang Bang It's a bridge too far Um...

Who else?

I'm trying...

There must be one we're forgetting What about one of his comedies?

His comedies, the lead characters are not Uh...

They're not as well regarded as those other ones I guess maybe Richard III would be in there Richard III, yes We got to get more women than Lady Macbeth And Juliet in there Who else do we have?

I guess maybe instead of...

Oh Beatrice from Taming of the Shrew Yeah...

Yeah, she's good, right?

Powerful Lady She's a powerful lady Okay, put Beatrice, is that her name though?

See, that's the thing, if they don't have a name I believe that it is Is she like Black Widow though, or she's just...

Heh heh heh Or she's just what?

She's just...

She was barely put in there just to get, you know Like no one really knows her Although she'll have a movie of her own Taming of the Shrew is pretty famous Taming of the Shrew is but Beatrice I'm not sure that...

I mean there are probably Shakespeare fans out there Or like Beatrice, of course, but like...

Probably Shakespeare fans screaming at their iP right now But me Beatrice doesn't like Oh, you know, like if you were to say Hamlet Everyone, you don't even need to say Shakespeare Well he's the titular rule Yeah, everyone knows who that is Oh, the rights these are title characters Yeah, there's never been another Romeo But Beatrice...

And there will be Other than Caesar Romeo What if it was called the Taming of Beatrice, the Shrew?

See, that is...

How do we just call her the Shrew?

Okay, the Shrew is in there Great No, that's been my opinion If you want to be nominated for Emmys If you're an actor and you want to be nominated for Emmys Better make a pretty woman your wife You should always insist that the show be titled after your character Because then...

Because Nurse Jackie, Dexter Because anytime you go out there and present on the Emmys And when I say present, I mean stick your asses out on the Emmys Stick your red ass out there To let everyone know you're ready to mate They always say like, Nurse Jackie herself Edie Falco Or TV's Dexter Can I tell you something, Scott?

What?

This is a name that changes all the rules 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?

No Valerie Val...

But that was her real name though It was her real name but it was also the character's name It was Valerie Jarrett, right?

She played...

I thought the picture was right She had that whole career as a sitcom star before she went to work For Obama Valerie Harper Valerie Harper, right?

Was the star of the show that became the Hogan family?

Right Valerie Harper had a contract dispute And they were like, you can't fire Valerie I think, yes, I think she thought like there's this...

She's like, look, this is my show Yeah Boeing, she's gone, the Hogan family She's gone, Sandy Duncan is in Sandy Duncan is in To win And they didn't call it Sandy No they didn't, they called it the Hogan family But do they call it...

Let that be a lesson to all of you Aren't they calling it the Conner family too?

The Rosanthin?

The Conners, yeah The Conners, yeah There's a precedent There's a precedent but the Hogan family was canceled Like right after...

No it was not, Hogan family ran for a while Did it?

Let's look this up How long did the Hogan family We're looking into the control Both looking at the booth and no one's in there No, everyone's just like leaving Alright, we'll figure this out Sam, back with a bowl of popcorn That's what you went to go eat Popcorn?

That's not going to be a...

Give you a filled up stomach What am I trying to say?

That's not going to give you a filled up stomach That's not going to give you a filled up stomach Let's talk about recent TV trivia I feel like we've talked about I dream of Jeannie and Valerie TV trivia?

Yeah Is there a recent show that has any kind of trivia that you know?

We talked about Smash though, that's a similar reason Smash is pretty recent There was an episode of 60 Minutes on the other night Let's talk about the trivia I heard that...

Was an Oprah Winfrey a 60 Minutes contributor for a while?

Or is she still one?

Was she?

I think she's like, it's like one of those things We're like, I'm Mike Wallace I'm Lady Bird Johnson No, who am I thinking of?

I'm Lady Bird Johnson And I'm Oprah Winfrey Remember me?

Here's what's weird, the Hogan family?

They're not listed in IMDB I bet if I put in Valerie Then it would...

Oh really?

Is this a Mandel effect?

Oh no, is this a Bernstein Bears?

Does everyone know it as Valerie?

That is interesting, how do you IMDB this?

1986 to 1991 1986 to 1991 Six seasons!

Six seasons!

How many of these are Valerie seasons?

How many of these are Hogan families?

I don't know man, if you look up the Wikipedia not IMDB bro!

Alright man, I'll look at the wiki!

By the way...

Meanwhile Sam is just eating popcorn Not one to help us at all And no one cares about this Just munching on popcorn like we're a movie or something Munching on popcorn!

He's behind this like large rectangular glass And we're just a movie to him and he's just eating popcorn and enjoying himself We are like a little movie to him We are the best movie Oh I like the sound of that Alright what do you got on the Hogan family?

Hogan family, originally titled Valerie and later Valerie's family That's right!

Because they did a season of just where they were grieving her It aired on NBC from 86 to 90 And then on CBS from 90 to 91 What a tumultuous show this is!

It had its ups, oont, downs Mmm!

It was Valerie from 86 to 87 And Valerie's family from 87 to 88 Okay so one year with Valerie One year without Valerie where they didn't have Sandy Hogan right?

Sandy Duncan, Sandy Hogan Sandy Duncan, Sandy Hogan And then what are we talking? Four years with Sandy?

I guess four years with Sandy What are the decisions?

The people you meet in heaven What are the decisions they're making like this concept is too good to let go This concept of a family Yeah exactly Who was on the show that they couldn't let out of their contract?

Maybe Joey Lawrence on this?

No Jason Bateman was on it Jason Bateman was on it, okay That's it when you got a Bateman You don't want to let him out of your contract No, you'll move heaven and earth Keep that Bateman close to your heart Keep your Bateman's close Valerie Harper, Sandy Duncan, Jason Bateman, Danny Ponce Of course Jeremy Licht and Josh Taylor Who are these people?

There might have been one year Where I was like This episode Was one of my favorites And I can see the results And people We've talked about the various Reasons why people vote For certain episodes And why they don't vote For certain episodes Some of it comes down to the title If a title Reminds them Of what was in the episode In the particular way Or to remind them of a lost love That's right If like say an episode is called Jennifer Mandrell And you used to date someone Named Jennifer Mandrell That's right I mean that you may vote For that episode Exactly And you may be a redneck Occasionally I will see an Episode is not getting its due And I may have tried to Bump up the votes in the past And voted for it a few times Maybe like about four years ago I did not vote for any of them This year Nor I believe the previous two years But it was an interesting Insight into the man And thank you Scott And I'll see you later Alright, wait, now you're leaving I'll go out on that There's no way I'm going to top it Alright, let us Terry know further Let us get to your Episode 10 Number 10 Alright, Episode 10 This is Episode 566 Which...

And we did about 60 episodes Yeah, but...

And we ended the year on about 577 or so Alright, this is 566 And this is an episode Called the Calvin's Triplets Oh boy The Calvin's Triplets Let's talk about these guys This is The third in a trip-titch Or trip-tick How does one say that?

Trip-tish Trip-tish This is a trip-tish This is a trilogy That started Several years ago Approximately, if I had to guess We did the first one of these Six years ago or so In a humble cabin with a dirt floor Maybe five years ago Two guys Taren Kill'em And Paul Brittain Who you would know from Saturday Night Live Taren has a show out there Right now called Single Parents On ABC that he's in They were on Saturday Night Live Together and they Enjoyed each other's company so much They wanted to do an episode of the podcast together So they came...

So they did?

And the end Alright, let's go to that clip No, they came and did a hilarious episode Called the Calvin's Twins Where they...

And they didn't have anything planned They just...

I remember...

I said, okay, what do you guys want to do?

And Taren turned to Paul and said I was thinking about something where Like, people...

These guys raise horses And Paul said, okay And...

Is that what he sounds like to me?

Okay!

That's what he sounds like to me It's a little...

Okay!

Mr. Kill'em Oh, wow!

Anything you say, Mr. Kill'em?

This is demeaning No, and those guys just ripped A hilarious episode where they were...

Horse fight promoters Who also owned a bee honey farm Where horses punch each other to death That's right And they were twins even though they had separate names Beaver Hopox and Chico Hands That's right Collectively they were known as the Calvin's Twins So they did that episode which was really really funny And then last year we did...

And it was a long time in between the sequel But we were able to get them both together again And they did another episode where the Calvin's Twins returned And they brought in Ryan Gull Who was a hilarious guy that we have both worked with A cast member of the Bajillion Dollar Properties with you That's right Really funny guy and he knows Taren and Paul And they said, hey, can we get Ryan involved?

So he came in and played Bizbee St. Hancock Who was their arch rival Who then ended up realizing at the end of that episode That he was related to them And Ergo, we now have the Calvin's Triplets And of course we had to get together and do another episode So we're going to listen to this This is just part of the episode This is the beginning part of the episode pretty much This is your episode 10 Number 10 Welcome to the Bajillion The Bajillion Chico and Bizbee are here And we brought in Petunia Petunia is here Petunia!

Calm down now Petunia What a sweet little baby She's a champion but she's a lady You ever dressed up as a...

Oh yeah As a stormtrooper That's like a Star Wars From Star Wars Not a...not a...no no no I don't want to paint the wrong picture for anyone That's right Like a Star Wars Pure Stormtrooper Star Wars That's right Yeah, so...

Kids love it They come in and you can sell it to them You can say, would you like to ride a stormtrooper?

That's right, Bizbee is a huge Star Wars fan Is this part of your business now Is riding the horses that are going to fight later?

Well, that's one thing We have a meeting every Monday morning now At 11 p.m. and we talk about Pre-prayer Pre-prayer Pre-prayer Pre-prayer Every Monday morning At 11 p.m.

You guys have very unusual sleep cycle We only follow Greenwich Mean Time We never change our clocks That's right We think daylight savings is a hoax It's a hoax and a scam Baa Thank you Chico So, and you guys have a creative thing we can do To expand the business Yeah, and this is one of the new ones Why aren't the kids paying to ride these horses Before they knock each other to death?

Right, right Well, first of all, your options Decrease about 50% Post-fight Pre-fight, you got the pickings You got two options there Because you never You never ride a horse Uh-oh Like More than 20 minutes out from fight Because as soon as you ride a horse And it's And it's before 20 minutes Before they're in fighting mode They just become a riding horse There's a riding horse at that point They're not a fighting horse That's right, and then But if you were in that 20 minute window With that horse you've been training and breathing And prepping for the fight They'll hold on to that The brains can't fall in form and go like Oh wait, maybe riding is what we're supposed to be doing That's right, horse never forgets Does it cause any sort of Well, within 20 minutes of a fight Right, then they do forget Just because...

After the 20 minute marker They definitely forget What's the premise of what I was explaining?

But never But never But never For kids Unless it's 20 You gotta get it on the same page On one of your Monday morning meetings At 11 p.m.

Yeah, Ryan was in Taren's Movie that they directed, but I mean they did Yeah, they've known each other for a while I think I think from Groundlings, but yeah, they Never know for sure They're really funny together Scott, I'd like to introduce a new Tradition here on the best of Can I just say one fact about the previous clip Before we do that You have to listen to the rest of that Episode that was just pretty much the Beginning eventually Chico gets married To the Russian oligarchs daughter Marinka in that episode And we make a lot of side bets A lot of really funny stuff happening in that Episode, alright Paul, do you want to start This new tradition now or after the break?

That was a good fact, let me start it right Now before the break.

Alright, here we go.

I'd like to read The call sheet order for bajillion-dollar Number You know how interested I am in call sheets Now call sheets, if you don't know what these are This is the bit of information that goes out to Every person working on the crew And every actor to let you know what is happening The next day And the actors are listed in order of importance To the production That's correct.

So when you have a show like I did You're number one on the call sheet That's right.

For the entire time So on bajillion-dollar properties This is no different No different than any of Why would you do something different for a show like The jillion-dollar properties Eighth most important Eighth most important Eugene Cordaro Ok, well he was not one of the original cast members That's right.

He came in a little later so I understand that.

That's right.

Seventh most important.

Ok, this is where we get down to it.

Dan Adoot!

Why?

Sixth most important Sixth most important You think they would go in alphabetical order You think?

But they sure didn't Maybe reverse alphabetical order No, they went in order of importance Sixth most important Ryan Gall He's number six Fifth most important Drew Tarver Wow!

Incredible Incraub!

He's probably number one on the call sheet For his new television show Which comes out on Comedy Central next year Fourth most important Mandelmon Really?

Yeah, ok.

Third most important Uh-huh Tim Balts Huh?

Ok Second most important Ok, we only have two left As I, uh, yeah, and I believe Ok, I think I know who this will be Tawny News Tawny News I'm number two.

Congratulations to her And most important Paul left Tom Kinsen Number one on the call sheet Number one on the call sheet Number one on the call sheet Number one on our hearts Number one with a bullet Now, what's interesting to me About this call sheet is Of course you were going to be number one Because it was You, uh, the boss You're the boss, you have the most experience Uh, and you were the, uh, the person hired To anchor the show So of course you have to be number one But the other six were Hired as equals So I wonder who Just who made that order Because it certainly was not me I'm curious about it myself I don't think it was cool up It probably was random But why wouldn't they do it in some sort of alphabetical manner?

Could it be the order in which people were hired?

No, because I believe Dan was hired first Wow, and the first shall be last Scripture tells us Maybe that's, oh, that might have been it That it was, maybe it was In the reverse order in which they were hired So they, they were like, they knew how many people they had Right, and they kept, they kept like Ok, he's in Why went the way when they picked Dan number two?

We'll build the pyramid on his back That's hilarious to me I think I was hired last You were hired last, but you were the You were the anchor of the show Exactly Congratulations to you, and I do believe that At our household yesterday We received a package In which that call sheet Was put into a Christmas or anything That's correct So and The bajillion dollar call sheet Has been the subject of much discussion Over the years?

Has it, really between the actors It's a reference, it's a frequent reference Mm-hmm And so I gifted everyone with an orange Of the call sheet And a magnet It has a prominent place Oh really, you can turn the ornament into a magnet No, there was also a magnet in the package Oh, there was Ok, I didn't throw it away No, I didn't open the package All I knew was I saw Ryan Gull Had put up an Instagram of it And so when Cool Up I saw the package was from you I knew what it was Cool Up, opened it, started laughing Put it on the tree, but I did not see the magnet Delighted that it was on the tree The magnet was in the box as well Ok, I hope I pray I will bring it up to her when I get home Oh, my sincere hope is that you find that magnet I believe that ornament is right next to our Freedom ornament, which you also made for Lauren and I That's right, I'd like to make ornaments for people That's fine, I didn't know that you could Well, I just send away to a place Yeah, but I didn't think that you had the ability to do that I don't, I made my assistant do it Good for you That's what they're for Alright, look, let's go to a break A wonderful tradition You're saying this is a tradition that we're going to do Every best of now Yeah, is read the order of that call sheet?

I'm in Great I think that you're thinking of a Simpsons episode though Not the Joey Dollar properties Alright, let's go to a break When we come back we will go through to The other side!

We will die and go to heaven We'll be right back We are here This is the best of comedy bang bang Number two Part two Part two Two before Remember when Hotshots made a second movie And they said instead of calling it part two Let's call it part two Duh Because that's not, people don't do that Duh Right, I think you could also take it that way Yeah So they were having fun and we're having fun That was a lot of fun I did like the Hotshots movies when I saw them Umm, I don't remember much about them I remember I went to one of them with my mother And we saw it at the Cypress Cinema And we laughed I always enjoyed that going to a movie And laughing And laughing with my mother We would occasionally go to movies together And I remember a couple of instances Where we just had a really good time Three Migos was one And I had seen it already I went to a...

I feel like it was A screening before it came out Is that even possible?

I don't know But I do Did you go to the premiere of Three Migos?

No, of course I did not Go to the premiere Heaven for me We're a precocious child But I saw it I remember the night I saw it Two things of interest happen I went with my school My school This is a school trip You know guys I'm gonna be honest with you I'm drunk Well let's go to the movies Three Migos?

We're in I went with my friend from a school And he drove I believe he had a Mustang As I recall Oh shit!

Like an old 60s Mustang Yeah man!

And we First of all we Watched Three Migos And the Reels were out of order This is before films were projected digitally So the Reels were out of order And I at a certain point In the movie started thinking like This feels like I've missed something But it's the jokes are It's a pretty random movie So I was like maybe not Maybe I'm just not getting something And then midway through that feeling Suddenly they switched Reels And started another Reel of the film And it went backwards in time I was like oh I understand They mixed up the Reels on this movie Someone's incompetent Still just as funny though And I loved it So I took... I told my mom Oh my gosh I saw the...

I saw the funniest movie We gotta go see it again Saw Three Migos Hot Shots was another one And then I also remember I went to Paul Blart Mollkop with my dad And we laughed ourselves silly During that One of my fondest memories about my dad Who was a very reserved person Was we used to watch SCTV together Really?

That late at night On Saturday?

Yeah the Friday night ones That were like 12-30 at night And were 90 minutes long Wow And I remember sitting in the kitchen With him watching on this little TV With Dine-up Mmmhmm Well someone was in the kitchen I know So you would sit in the And the TV was in the kitchen There was like a little TV in the kitchen Were you on stools?

Or how were you sitting?

No we have like a little kitchen table Kitchen table?

Ok, got it, got it And that's where all TV was Watched in your home?

No, that was...

We had a big TV in the living room So why are you not watching it in the living room?

Because it was late at night And I think my mom was just Didn't want to keep people up So watch it on the tinier TV Which was just Further away from where people were Got it, got it And we would watch the show And laugh and like look Like that kind of laugh Where you look at the other person Right Because you can't believe how funny it is And you have to check in with each other What was your favorite S.C. TV moment if you can recall?

Oh my god I don't know if I could pick one I love that show so much And I got it on DVD And was afraid it wasn't going to hold up And it held up It was even funnier to me I have to do a big rewatch Of all of those Because I have to rewatch them And kids in the hall too I would like to rewatch Yeah Well now kids in the hall They have the complete set out there S.C. TV It's harder to get Because they only have sporadic Episodes out there on DVD Well they did Rhino did a big Reissue But I think they only did the NBC ones I think the ones that are Like previous to that are not Available Unfortunately But there's a lot of the NBC ones Yeah, those really old ones That I remember they used to They used to run a PBS Yeah I haven't seen any of that stuff And it really launched Maybe they're on YouTube I found that Oh, yeah I'd like to see Harold Ramis was a feature Performer Yeah, I would love to be in A joining rooms with you Watching those That would be fun I would love to be in a Joining kitchens Why don't we go to The Museum of Television And a tolerance Ask and of tolerance You watch S.C.

I was afraid you were going to Pull that one out.

I know.

It takes me But here we go.

This is your episode nine.

Number nine.

Ah, naga da.

R.I.P.

I think In one of these clips We talk about that?

I'm not sure.

I definitely listen To it.

It's in one of the episodes.

But not this one because This is episode 572.

So Still in the 500?

We always will be.

Six weeks or so after That's a weird coincidence.

Six weeks or so after our Previous clip, 566.

This is an episode called Changerous.

And the parties Involved Our two people by the name of Jason Manzukas and Paul F. Tompkins.

And it was a party.

It truly was.

Do you remember this Episode, Paul?

I remember that it asked the Question, what if Michael Jackson And would have posted a Help him.

Called Changerous.

Yes.

And we never got an answer.

We never did.

To that what if.

That is the first part of This episode.

Now this is quite often Jason will say to me like, Hey, I can't walk into it.

Who was the first person?

Paul's here.

Hey, not me.

Hey.

Hey, how's it going?

Oh, yeah, definitely.

This is more Jason.

Oh, yeah.

He'll say to me, Hey, I want to do some Episodes.

We should do one with you, Me and Paul.

I'd love to do one with Mary and Darcy.

We heard that on the previous Best of.

And this was one where he said That's right.

And this one was a lot of fun.

This was just from a couple of months ago.

Yeah.

And what happens Previous to this clip is Paul, you were playing Button Willow McKittrick.

That's right.

And how did you get the name for Button Willow McKittrick?

That is a sign on the highway here in California.

I think if you're going up North, you will see this sign for two different places.

One is Button Willow.

One is McKittrick and they're underneath each other Yes.

And each other.

From the very first time I saw that, it seemed like a name to me and then seemed like a name to me.

It's come to find out.

It has been used as a character name several times in several different things.

Oh, really?

Interesting.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

That happened to me with my old movie, Cane and Rhodes, which is a if you go North on the 405 or the 101 or whatever it is.

And I was like, oh, that's a good name.

Cane and Rhodes.

This is a good name.

So I called the lead character and a movie that I wrote back in the day, Co-wrote back in the day, Cane and Rhodes.

It has not been produced.

Almost got produced.

Very close.

Got a green light at one point.

I thought you were going to say somebody else used the name, but they don't.

No one's used the name.

Please don't use the name.

No, you don't.

You've mailed the script to yourself so you're in the click.

I have, of course.

Now, so Button Willow McKittrick described Button Willow McKittrick if you will.

He's from another planet and the future.

Yes.

From the future and another planet, the planet's name is Earth.

Earth.

Yeah.

Right.

It's Earth with an extra tea.

Right.

Something like that.

And you're basically based on Mr. Mixle-plick.

The great kind of, yeah, that and the great gazoo.

Who's the great gazoo again?

He was the Flintstones, which was a cartoon about cavemen that was based on the honeymooners.

Right.

At some point- What if the honeymooners were in prehistoric times?

Yes.

And we could just rip them off and no one cares.

Exactly.

At some point late in their run, they added a space alien called the great gazoo.

In order to lure children into- I have no- Yeah, because kids were on board with this cartoon.

With a cleanser.

Well, I mean, that would happen sometimes with cartoons like Saturday morning cartoons where they would try to add an element in order to freshen it up or I remember scrappy-do was one of those words.

Yes.

Kids need someone to relate to.

So let's put in a kid- They're taking that from sitcoms, which, you know, a running- And also Batman and Robin.

Robin was at it because they were like, these kids who read Batman are not relating to this elderly wealthy- elderly- Well, seriously.

But I mean, why- did kids want to relate to anyone in Batman?

That's the thing now.

I wonder relate to Batman.

Yes.

That's something I hated scrappy-do.

Yeah.

I hated Godzuki.

Yeah.

I hated Robin.

Because you don't want to- They think that it's the wish fulfillment aspect of it of like, oh, cool.

That would be to be Robin.

Yeah.

No one cares about being Robin.

They want to be Batman.

Well, they want to be Batman.

Yes.

They want to be Batman.

Yeah.

They want to be Batman.

Yeah.

So, but there was also- The great cubs like Cousin Oliver on the Brady Bunch.

They were like, let's add a kid.

Let's add a kid.

These kids aren't cute anymore.

We gotta throw out a kid.

They're throwing their pubes.

They're throwing pubes.

They're good- They're good- They're grown pubes.

These kids grown pubes.

They're grown pubes.

Let's get a kid without pubes.

I didn't get that, but- Obviously, you can tell I'm doing Donald Trump impression.

It's Alec Baldwin's Pitch Perfect Donald Trump impression.

That he did in all three Pitch Perfect movies.

That's right.

Why did he do that?

He would- It was bookended by him.

I don't know why.

Hey, welcome to Pitch Perfect One.

Let me tell you a story.

Better what your girls are saying.

So the great Kazoo was the space-selling voice by Harvey Korman.

Oh.

Who was observing these guys.

And he called them dumb-dums all the time.

He would never interact with them?

Yeah, he would.

With Fred and Barney.

Okay.

They were the only ones who could see him because he could make his best disappear.

Okay.

And he called them dumb-dums all the time.

Great.

Dum-dums.

Okay, I wonder where the clip is.

I think it's going to be a great story.

So before this clip that we're going to hear, we've established you are button willow mckitrick.

This is established.

And you have established that there is a science prophecy in which the earth is in grave danger.

Yeah.

Unless Jason and Zukas and I do something.

I can't recall what it is.

And we are going to hear this clip.

By the way, I think previously to this clip also it's been established that my nickname is Skittles for some reason.

And so when someone says Skittles, you'll know that that's a name that you and Jason were calling me during this episode.

Let's hear it.

This is your episode nine.

Number nine.

I'm glad we got here.

And I would like to begin.

All right.

What side are you?

The godfather.

Beats queen.

Okay.

Make your case earthling.

I'm choosing to interpret this as the moon.

I'm choosing to interpret this as the movie the godfather.

Versus the movie the queen.

Yes.

Okay.

Now the queen.

Sure.

A great.

A great movie.

That was the queen.

The queen.

Yeah.

Okay.

Now it's the godfather.

Yes.

So.

We said godfather beats queen.

That's right.

But on earth.

Oh, I see.

So you're saying I'm not allowed to.

No.

On earth in the vernacular, if you're talking about a godfather, you're saying I'm going to say it happens all the time.

No, hold on a second.

I'll grant you the first one.

Yeah, but the second one.

The second one.

I agree.

Is this a stretch?

No, I'm going to do the queen as queen.

So here's what I'm going to say.

I'm going to choose.

Well, here's what I'm going to do.

What about godfather versus the band queen?

That's what I was going to say.

You can.

Why did I choose the godfather?

Right?

What about godfather's pizza?

You can interpret queen.

However, you want.

Okay.

Right?

Is this what the argument is?

First, first, make this case to me.

Okay.

Not to him.

So, is this a sign mark?

I chose it.

I'm choosing to interpret.

We're in chambers.

I'm going to.

You're on a can I approach the thing?

Please.

I'll allow it.

I would like to take the point of you in favor of the godfather.

And I will speak to the movie, The Godfather.

However, Scott would like to interpret the concept of queen is up to him.

He can do the queen of solar ethe Franklin.

He can do queen the band.

He can do the concept of queen, the queen of England or any queen, like the monarchy queen, like anything.

That's the argument.

I think.

I don't know.

What do you think?

So, noted.

I wanted to do a gavel thing.

I don't know.

You have a phone next.

So you just bang that on the table.

Great idea.

Classic Skittles.

Hey.

Then it will be your interpretation of godfather versus your thank you versus your interpretation of queen.

All right.

And we're saying why it beats the other person.

I think so.

Okay.

You make the case for the superiority.

Yeah.

I think the godfather is just a godfather.

If we're going to do this, let's do it.

I think godfather is a superior film that has affected an impacted cultural, like cultural understandings of family, of taking one's own life into one's hand to make, to protect your family and forward their dominance.

Much the way a queen could also do.

A queen.

Queen.

Everything is right.

Godfather has performances that are exceptional.

It almost destroyed Francis for a couple of his life.

He made, you know, here's what I want to say.

You'll have your time.

Here's what I want to say.

Apologies.

Here's what I want to say.

There is no doubt in my mind that godfather is for everybody to take into consideration is a superior thing in their life.

Be it the movie.

Be it the pizza chain.

Be it the James Brown godfather of soul.

Be it any of those interpretations.

It is because the concept of godfather is someone who looks out for you in your time of need.

Someone who shepherds you forward when your parents die.

Objection.

Objection leading who is responsible.

Someone who is responsible.

Someone who is responsible for spiritual well being as well as your physical well being should you find yourself in trouble.

That is the job of godfather.

And as such, I believe it is an invaluable position societally.

Like our society is built on godfathers, not queens.

I rest my case, your honor.

Well stated, stupid.

Skittles.

If you call me Skittles, I don't know whether I want to do this.

You know what that is?

It sounds like sour Skittles.

No.

I'm sweet Skittles.

Do they make sour Skittles?

Oh yeah, they make sour Skittles.

Oh I want that.

Oh really there's a couple right here on the table.

No, I'm not so fine.

Excuse me, this is my time.

Yes, please.

You may proceed.

Your honor.

We're all familiar with the concept of queen.

Be it the band queen, Freddie Mercury, Brian May.

Keep going.

The rest.

Professor and Mary Ed.

Whether it be...

Can you name one more member of Queen Do you think?

Roger Taylor.

Okay.

How about that?

Great.

Why did you leave him up?

And a little basshead, a little Basie guy.

But we also have the movie...

Was there a Roger Taylor in Queen and in Duranter?

Yes, can you believe it?

Weird.

And I believe they played the same instrument.

The drums.

But we also have the...

Queen is the most powerful player on the chessboard.

It can move in any direction as far as it wants.

Sure, King is the one that we all want to capture, but Queen is the one where if you lose Queen, you've lost the game.

No, you haven't.

You've only lost Queen.

But you...

Objection, your honor.

You lose Queen.

You've not lost the game.

No, we all know how...

If you lose King...

We all know how chess is played.

If you lose King, you lose King, you lose King.

I'm talking metaphorically.

You lose King.

You've overruled.

He is metaphorically speaking.

But that...

You can't use metaphor.

He's set over ruled.

That's enough out of you.

Please, Skittles.

Now, we all know Godfather is a wonderful film.

I'm not arguing that.

1972, a wonderful classic starring Pacino in his iconic career-defining role until Sent of a Woman.

That's right.

Pre-yelling.

Whoa.

He did not say whoa in Godfather.

That's a mark against it, I have to say.

But Queen is so powerful.

And really, I think you are...

Objection, your honor.

I think you are forgetting about the scene where he says, Fredo, you never speak against the family.

Your honor.

Am I going to be able to make my case?

Objection?

Without interruption?

Objection overruled.

I'm going to ask you...

Mmm...

...man's...

...suckus...

...to zip it.

Strong words.

But I appreciate it, your honor.

Thank you very much.

You got it, Skittles.

After all, Godfather is a wonderful film, 1972, but what happened in 1974?

Godfather Part II.

And as every film historian will tell you, Godfather Part II is superior to Godfather.

So something has already beaten Godfather.

So Godfather is not the most powerful player upon the board, but what about the sequel to Queen?

Queen with Adam Lambert.

Not as good.

So there go!

Queen is the best, and Godfather is not the best, ergo Queen beats Godfather.

I rest my case, your honor.

Is anybody...

Oh, I was going to say silent, so I was talking.

Okay.

First of all, I want to say thank you for your impassioned cases that you've made.

Can I say your honor?

You're welcome.

Okay, Skittles.

No, you're pushing it.

My question, just as a point of procedure here is...

Have you ever seen anything involving a courtroom?

What leads you to belief that this is the time we're all just going to...

Get down.

I'm clearly making you a pronouncement.

Oh, that's what I... Okay.

Okay, got it.

Got it.

You, Earthlings, have given me much to think about.

And as much as you have both made wonderful cases, compelling cases, and impassioned cases, for your cause.

I do have a ruling.

It can only go one way.

Wait a second.

Skittles.

Can I talk to you for a second?

Yeah, okay.

Can we...

Sidebar?

Can we have a moment?

Can we recess for approximately 120 seconds?

A sidebar where it's just the two of you?

Where we just want to...

Not usually how we do things, but...

Okay, I'll allow it.

Why are we...

Bud watch yourselves, God bless you.

Thank you.

But why are we...

Yeah.

...letting this time traveling...

Cock sucker.

...decide our fate, right?

Yeah, what is he in charge of us?

Because obviously, we hurt each other.

We are friends, right?

Yeah, we're friends.

And we agree, even though we both said what we believe, that I am right.

No.

Wait.

Obviously you still...

No, I definitely made a better case.

No, I made a better case.

You were so close to contempt twice.

No.

Listen, okay, you know what?

Hey, are you fucking kidding me?

We gotta get the people of this planet.

We gotta...

We have to do like an independent state kind of thing.

We gotta get the people of this planet.

We all band together.

I thought we had an agreement.

And we forced this little tiny motherfucker out of here.

Let's get this fucker in a shoe.

Let's kill him.

Let's get him in a shoe and kill him.

This is exactly what the problem is.

This is what I think we need to do.

Put it to a vote.

You sneak up behind it.

No.

People can either support me or they can support you.

You hold what we'll bring out.

You hold this to a vote.

That's what we'll bring our planet together.

Why?

You hold them by the two coats and I'll just take a knife out.

If we want to subvert the prophecy and make a prophecy...

...and make a prophecy...

We get science-flakes.

I am with Scott or I am with Jason.

Okay, so you sneak up behind him.

I'm growing impatient.

Okay.

Hey, you're done with the other little...

Yes.

We're done.

Yes.

Recessors over.

You've already...

Alright.

I'm ready to give my ruling.

Skittles.

You're right.

I don't know where that guy went, but okay.

Keep looking at me though.

I really want to hear a little bit of this.

I'm ready to give my ruling.

Skittles.

You're right.

I really want to hear this ruling.

I will.

Okay.

Godfather, it is an extremely important touchstone for you earthlings.

It, in many ways, in all the interpretations.

Godfather of soul, Godfather of the movie, Godfather of pizza.

Godfather, the guy who looks out for you and your spiritual well-being.

Sure.

Important.

Queen.

All of the reasons that you cited.

They all check out.

I was especially moved by your Queen sequel argument.

Holy shit, I'm going to win.

Mostly, what I got to say is...

Religion is bullshit.

Queen beats Godfather.

What?

It is so ordered.

I demand an uprising.

Look behind you.

He's behind you.

What are you doing?

I got you.

No, no, no.

I'm in the bag.

No, I'm in the bag.

I won.

Holy shit.

No, I won.

I demand an uprising.

People, if you support me, if you support the Godfather, I'm like, that's the bad.

We will find his ships.

We will go to Earth and we will destroy them.

I've never seen anything killed before.

Oh, a good episode.

If I say so myself.

I was, I'm very surprised that this is in the top of the countdown.

This is the Godfather versus Queen debate.

This is one of the few episodes in all my years of guesting on the show where I went in with literally nothing.

Did you?

I absolutely don't forget that it was happening.

Yes.

I forgot.

It was a Saturday record.

I don't think it was a Saturday, but it wasn't a Saturday.

Was it?

I'm going to let it.

I had not written it in my calendar.

We had talked about it on text, but I'd never put it in my calendar.

I completely forgot.

So I woke up and got a text from you asking if I was on my way.

Sometimes if it's like 10, sometimes I wait as long as 15 minutes.

You're right.

We recorded this on September 29th, which was a Saturday.

Yeah, I knew I was right, but thanks.

Okay.

At 2 p.m.

Yeah.

2 p.m.

Yeah, yeah.

And you had totally forgotten about it.

And I think I've been up way late the night before for some reason.

I don't know if I was working or if I was just like, fuck.

Red Dead Redemption 2.

Maybe Red Dead Redemption 2.

A second.

And so rushed over there.

I might have just been like, had been awake for hours and completely forgot about it.

I think you have completely forgotten about it.

And you, but what's great about you, Paul, is as I said, hey, are you on your way?

And you were like, no, I forgot about it, but I'll be right there.

And you were over in 15 minutes.

Yeah.

And luckily I don't live that far.

Right.

And I just had no idea what to do.

And I knew I wanted to do something new, but I didn't have anything.

And I really did.

And my phone, I keep a list of potential character names.

And I saw that and I was like, I'll do something with this.

I'll figure it out.

Great.

So button will, Mcchickrick was born and you said you were surprised to hear it on the episode, but I think the- Because it didn't feel, honestly, it did not feel that good at the time.

I think because I was so unprepared.

But the thing that I was so glad that we got at was the concept of that debate.

Right.

Does Queen beat Godfather?

Queen beat.

Yeah, I can't remember.

I don't even think we played it in the clip of how we got into it.

But do you remember why we- I can't remember.

No, I can't.

Why?

It was very fun to debate the merits of Queen versus Godfather.

Yeah.

There were so many things.

Everything that happened was, you know, an accident and, you know, just grabbing onto a thing that seemed intriguing, that came up out of conversation.

You know, the idea that the earth is in danger.

One of you guys might even have suggested that or something.

I know, I believe it was you.

You just said that us dumb-dums, you had something in front of the tell us.

Oh, I think- Okay.

And then I threw that out there and I was like, something will come.

Something will come, of course.

That's what this show is all about is something will come.

Something will come.

All right.

Speaking of coming, a break is coming right now.

And we have to get to it.

All right.

So when we come back, we are going to go into your episode eight.

This is fun.

We're getting closer and closer to number one.

I can't believe you.

Here we go.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang, best of 2018.

Must be jelly because jam don't shake like that.

Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

It's fun.

Are you having fun?

Are you having any fun?

I'm having fun.

What a weird song to write.

What is that from?

It's a song called Are You Having Any Fun.

It's like an old standard.

Is it from a musical?

It's an old standard.

Well, a lot of those standards are from musicals technically, but you would know it because they're just like some play that you put on.

You like to take me out to the ball game is from musical.

Exactly.

It's from, of course, the ball game take me out.

Ball game take.

Yeah.

But what a weird song to say.

Are you having any fun?

Like some things don't need to be songs.

You know, like turning to some things don't need to be songs.

Turning to your spouse.

I think I'm turning to your spouse.

I really think so.

Hey, are you having any fun?

That gives me a great idea for a song.

No, it doesn't have to.

It's a weird thing to ask.

Are you having any fun?

Hey, isn't that it's the holiday season, right?

It is.

Well, I mean, when people are listening to this, it's right after Christmas, but it is the holiday season.

That's the holiday season because the New Year's Eve is coming in.

Yeah, we'll go right around the corner.

But that song that goes, it's the holiday season and Hickory Doc.

I don't know this.

You know that song?

No, what is this?

Oh, fuck it.

Let me look it up.

But what is your issue with it?

What is it referring to?

It's got a couple weird moments in it where it's like, that's not a thing that people just say.

What does that have to do with the holiday season?

It's the holiday season lyrics.

It's the holiday season.

So whoop-dee-doo and Hickory Doc.

Whoop-dee-doo and Hickory Doc.

And don't forget to hang up your sock because at exactly 12 o'clock, boy, they're really boxing Santa in to a very specific timeline.

Yeah.

And yet investigators try to box a ODE.

They couldn't come up with a third rhyme for sock.

So they got sock-and-clock.

They start with Hickory Doc.

Yeah.

He'll be coming down the chimney down.

Who sings this piece of shit?

Andy Williams.

♪ Happy holidays ♪ Oh, it's that song ♪ Happy holidays ♪ But what's the tune of this?

It's the holiday season.

Listen to this, by the way.

Hickory Doc.

By the way, the previous verse does not even share the rhyme scheme of that verse.

It's the holiday season and Santa Claus is coming back.

Now you would expect it to be like crack sack.

Yeah.

Here are the lyrics.

The Christmas snow was white on the ground when old Santa gets into town.

He'll be coming down the chimney down.

I wouldn't have thought like- This is the laziest lyric writing ever.

It's the holiday season.

I'm saying that's back.

My policy and my crack.

My neck, my back.

You gotta lick it before you kick it.

Santa, this is some lazy shit.

It's some lazy shit, Andy Williams.

Guess who wrote it?

Guess who wrote it.

C.E. ever coop.

He did.

Why?

Why would he do this?

Just do the surgeon general.

Why would he do this to us?

Is that not enough for you?

Who's the current surgeon general?

That's a great question.

I will look it up.

Scotty.

Look it up, Scotty.

Look it up.

Scotty.

Look it up.

You're never gonna guess it.

Look, I'm never gonna guess it.

Never gonna guess it, never gonna guess it.

Woohoo, woohoo.

I'm gonna say it's- Don't look at the reflection in my eyes.

I have a story to tell you about that.

Oh you do.

If somebody else is a story, I'll tell you off back.

Okay, great.

Someone else is still- Kenneth.

The musical chess.

I think it's Kenneth Lonergan.

So close.

Vivec Murphy.

Vivec Murphy was my second choice.

Ah, sorry, I should have chosen him first.

Oh.

He was confirmed under President Barack Obama in 2017.

Oh he's still.

There's not a- Trump didn't put his own guy in there.

Wait, hold on.

He was replaced.

No, he's replaced.

No, you're right.

He is replaced.

Is his- is he even?

Yeah, he was replaced under Trump.

Hold on, then who is it?

Current surgeon general is- Oh, some Jerome Adams.

But he's not been confirmed yet.

Maybe we don't have one.

He doesn't sound like a real guy.

Jerome Adams.

Meanwhile, Vivec Murphy.

Why are we replacing this guy?

He's perfect.

He's the perfect Murphy.

The Murphy group.

Yeah, I just love you, you know.

I just love the Murphy group.

Great stuff about recently about him.

Aww, so great stuff.

Did we go to a break or are we back from a break?

We are back from a break.

Yes, we are.

You're right, we're back from a break.

All right, we need to get to the countdown.

Gotta get to the countdown.

We need to get back to this countdown.

Let's go to your episode eight.

Number eight.

All right, episode eight.

This is from earlier in the year.

This is episode 541.

Oh, now this one is a controversial pick.

Is it?

I don't know.

This is an episode called Is That A Joke?

Sounds familiar.

The people involved are Ben Schwartz and Thomas Middleditch.

And myself, of course.

And this is, okay, so Ben Schwartz and Thomas Middleditch, they are touring the country currently.

I believe they have four or five tour dates next year where they, including, are they playing Carnegie Hall or they're playing Radio City?

I can't remember.

Carnegie Hall.

I used to dream about the wonderful performers.

They're performers.

No, performance spaces that, oh, someday I would play.

And I've gotten to go on, and you and I have gotten to go on some great ones.

We, the theater, the Ace Hotel here.

The Great Space.

The Wiltern.

I was in that Miss.

That's right.

I think you were on.

That was exciting.

I just sang a song in it, but it was a lot of fun to do the Wiltern.

And then when we were in England, we played that big like 1600 seater.

We sold that out of, it was, was it the London Blaine?

No, it was the Shepherd's.

It was something Shepherd's book.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And remember backstage there were all these, on the walls they had all the people who had played there.

And it was like the Rolling Stones warm up concert.

And the who warm up concert.

Like they're not gonna play their regular show here, of course.

But it made me feel good, like, wow, I'm playing where the Rolling Stones played.

Oh, they're warm up concert.

But still, we've played some great places.

Maybe we'll play Carnegie Hall someday.

Maybe we will.

Oh, yeah, we should.

Let's do it this year, this coming year.

Let's play Carnegie Hall.

All right.

We'll put that up as our New York tour date.

I'm in.

If we do a tour.

I'm in.

Okay.

We'll do that, definitely.

But Tommy and Ben are out there touring the country right now with their Middle Ditch and Schwartz tour.

And they came on the show to promote it.

And when they're on the show, they basically just pick a crazy name and then play these crazy characters who don't know each other.

And this show is no exception.

This is your episode eight.

Let's hear it.

Number eight.

I don't know what his job is, but his name is Leonard Stooltap.

Hello, Leonard.

Hi.

Leonard Stooltap.

What an interesting name.

Oh my God, yeah, thanks.

I'm from all over the world.

I was born all over the world.

I was born in a plane.

You were born in a plane, which was just cut.

So my head was born in Russia.

My body was technically born in Switzerland.

And my legs were born in Amsterdam.

Amazing.

So you have so many nationalities.

Oh my goodness.

Thank you for saying that.

Wow.

But your accent sounds very, very...

Oh, I'm very posh.

Oh, that's all the different dialects from all around the world.

And I put them together in a beautiful stew.

And here I am, Leonard Stooltap.

Leonard Stooltap.

So it's so good to talk to you.

Thank you for being on the show.

Thank you.

I don't know why my producer hooked you up to the show, but obviously I hear you talk about something.

Well, I'll tell you what I do, and then you'll know why.

I'm a professional hooker.

A professional hooker.

I'm a professional hooker.

Don't call me a jig, although I'm a professional hooker.

Okay, I guess if you were not a professional and you were a hooker, you would just be like any of us, just having sex for free.

That's a funny joke.

So I guess what I am.

I'm not a joke.

As much as a funny joke.

Oh, that's the other thing I don't understand, jokes.

Oh, okay.

So wait, do you just say that's a funny joke after every single thing anyone says, just in case?

That's a funny joke.

Just in case someone says a joke, I say that's a funny joke.

Oh, it's terrible.

When I'm doing a eulogy, I say it at the end also, just in case.

You know what I mean?

How often are you doing eulogies, by the way?

That's a funny joke.

Like I'll do a eulogy probably once a week.

Once a week for people you know?

Cause you gotta get good at them.

It's just like a best man speech.

So you're sort of practicing for the ultimate eulogy that you're gonna get?

When I when I prostitute, I end up with a lot of people who are deceased afterwards.

And because of that, I have to get eulogies.

You wind up with people who are deceased afterwards.

Are you murdering them?

No, I bang so hard I bust them open.

Men, women.

So why would anyone hire you?

I don't know.

That's a joke.

They don't know.

It's not a joke.

It's a serious thing that you're doing.

Is that a joke?

No, that's not a joke.

Right.

So in my head, have you ever had sex before?

Yes, several times, I'm a married man.

Oh, really?

Who you married to?

Cool up?

How do you know her?

I just made up a funny word.

So how long have you been doing?

100%?

No, OK.

Really?

Yeah, you had visa, no way, right?

Well, you got the last name wrong.

OK, got it.

Cool.

Can I ask you a question?

Yes.

Oh.

What's it like when you're a sex?

What's it like?

I mean, it's a loving, tender communion of two bodies.

Of course.

Comangling and almost becoming one.

I'll just say, coming one.

Is that a joke?

And my question to you is, what's it like?

It's, I don't know.

It's like your private parts kind of tingle.

And then they sort of.

I'll tell you what it's like to have sex with me.

OK.

You have seen Avengers Infinity Gauntlet?

Yeah.

It's out by now, right?

Yeah, it's great.

Well, I mean, I don't think it's out by now.

Imagine all the stones, all the Infinity Stones, in my balls.

And every time I come, the power of all the Infinity Stones come together and burst through either your asshole or your vagina.

I mean, that's powerful.

That's what you're the Thanos of coming.

You said it.

I didn't say it.

You know what I mean?

Is that a joke?

That's a joke.

It's not a joke.

But sure.

So why would anyone hire you to do this?

Because every single person that you've ever had sex with deceased.

No, one person has not.

Who is that?

I don't want to say his name because he's a big celebrity.

Please, I don't want to say his name because he's a big celebrity.

I mean, you can't just tease us like this.

Who is this?

He may.

I can't believe I'm doing this.

Please give us a little gosh.

Ray Bradbury.

Ray Bradbury?

Yes.

Writer of Fahrenheit 451.

I didn't know that was.

Dan Deline.

Why?

Oh, I had no idea, really?

I saw him speak at my college once.

Oh, my goodness.

How was he?

Was he as cool as he wasn't bad?

Yeah, I mean, I don't know how cool he wasn't bad.

Oh, he was super cool.

Because he's a science.

He's one of those guys that puts on sunglasses and goes, let's do it.

I guess that's cool.

So wait a minute, because he's a science fiction writer, he was able to escape this sort of science fiction.

I guess.

I don't know.

I gave him my blow and he didn't blow up.

But I'm not here to talk about sex.

I'm here to talk about my new passion.

OK, good.

Because I think we've got about as far as we can go.

Oh, really?

That's right.

With the professional hooker bar.

What is your new passion?

What do you in do these days?

Oh, you want to hear about it right now?

Yes, if you're here to talk about it, I want to hear about it right now.

Let us tear it no further.

Create sports for babies.

You create sports for babies.

This is really like football.

I do like football.

I love football.

Well, I have a football baby league.

So it doesn't sound like you're creating a sport.

As much as you're just organizing a league.

Right, I guess I'm more of a soccer mom than anything.

Wait a minute.

So you're not creating new sports.

So let me.

Oh, yes, I am.

Do you want to hear the new sports I'm creating?

Yeah, that's what I thought you were talking about.

It's like baseball.

OK, but instead of a ball.

So it's a stick sport.

It's a stick sport and a ball sport.

It's a ball sport and the best combination of a stick sport and a ball sport.

What do the things you love about all the different sports?

Well, I love points.

We've got it.

OK, great.

I love competition.

Oh, my goodness, yes.

I love that they normally don't end in ties.

Yes, well, this one, this one, the only way to win is to not end with a tie.

OK, I love.

Imagine if you will close your eyes.

Imagine if you will, a sport that combines baseball, football, soccer, and flying all at the same time, but has nothing to do with Harry Potter.

OK, so not Quidditch.

It's not Quidditch.

But by the way, there is a lawsuit pending on me.

OK, wait.

There is a lawsuit pending.

Everybody gets on their brimes, not brooms, brimes.

Brimes, these are flying machines?

They fly, yes.

OK.

And they get their balls, and you have to take it and try to throw it through.

They're testicles?

Or they're hoop.

No, that's a funny joke.

Is that a joke?

That was a joke.

OK, I wouldn't know.

A broken clock is right twice a day.

I have something very similar to Quidditch, but it's not quite Quidditch.

OK.

OK, and so everybody gets on their brimes.

They go up.

They try to throw their balls through their hoops.

Whoever gets the most, the dingle-bops wins.

OK, what is this sport called?

It's called Quidditch.

It's spelled like Quidditch, but there's no.

The eye doesn't have a dot over it.

OK, so it's Quidditch.

Wait, is that a joke?

Because you're laughing.

No, I'm laughing because someone tickled my foot.

Oh.

And I don't even know what that is.

What did I just do with laugh?

That was a joke.

I thought it was a joke because of your laugh.

So it's Quidditch.

It's exactly like it's very similar to Quidditch.

It's spelled the same pronounced differently.

Yes, but it's very way less expensive.

It's so expensive to pay Quidditch because you got to get those brooms.

Well, you also have to be magic.

You use brimes, which exist.

Oh, that's the other thing.

I guess I'm magic.

Wait, you are magic?

I mean, obviously I thought that because of your, you know, yeah, I blow people up my tongue.

You don't think I'm magic?

What are you crazy?

Literally, I orgasm and someone and they explode into a million particles and then start life I knew as a tree.

You don't think I'm magic?

OK, I guess.

How did you become magic?

I feel like my producer should have introduced you as magic person first.

Oh, yeah, I guess.

I don't know.

I'm not your producer.

I don't know why you're yelling at me.

I'm not yelling at you.

In fact, I have more guys.

We've got all the bullet points for your Wikipedia page.

OK?

I'm goddamn magic.

I blow people up with my comma.

I have a sport like Quitch, but not really.

And I organize leagues of football and baseball for babies.

In what way are you magic?

I say, in what way are you magic?

Close your eyes.

How are you OK?

Close your eyes.

They're closed.

OK, open your eyes.

OK, for those 10 seconds or as we're closed, the entire room is made of blue and dragons were here.

What?

How would I know that?

I mean, your eyes have to be closed.

Wait, so no one can see your actual magic?

No, because your brain, you have to have, you have to focus on my words and my magic.

OK, let me close them again.

OK, oh my god, I can't, but look how many, oh my god, look how many dumplings are here.

Did you open your eyes?

I just opened them.

Yeah, there's no dumplings.

They all disappear.

They were all here.

How many dumplings were here?

Well, look at me.

Don't I look like I ate a bunch of dumplings?

Yeah, I mean, not really.

I look similar, right?

You don't really look different after you're done by me.

This guy says, there aren't even crumbs around you.

That's what I do with my magic.

Because the second you're eyes are closed, I can almost do anything.

Well, look, Leonard Stooltapp.

You're a very interesting person.

Magical abilities.

Yes, magic when you close your eyes.

You've had sex with Ray Bradbury, who's no longer with us.

What an interesting person you are, but we do need to get to our next guest.

Oh, there's another guest.

I'm not enough for you.

Well, I mean, I hope you stick around and speak to him.

Because him or, yeah, it is a him.

I don't have his profession here with me.

I have his name.

But I do have his name.

Yeah, please welcome to the show for the first time ever, Mitch Slocum.

Hi.

It's so good to meet you.

Yeah, it's great to meet you.

It's this is Leonard Stooltapp.

How are you?

OK.

What are you up to, Mitch?

What's your deal?

What's your whole thing?

What do you mean?

He's this guy coming at you.

Yeah, come on.

Get him in easy.

Get me in easy.

You're interested.

Welcome to the show.

I don't want you mean.

Oh, what?

Welcome to the show.

Thank you.

I'm trying to do some pleasantries before you have to immediately explain yourself.

OK.

Well, now do I explain, Mitch?

Please.

I mean, if you're ready to.

OK.

Well, I'm currently staying home, Father.

Stay home, Father.

That's wonderful.

How do you feel?

I don't work.

No, no.

I don't work because I was in a very man horse accident, horse collision.

Oh, no.

You collided with a horse or you were on top of a horse?

Four years ago, I was parambulating through a field, an open field.

What is parambulating?

You were walking to a field.

I'm so honest.

I'm just saying, walk.

Because parambulating sounds longer.

Close your eyes for one second.

Mm-hmm.

Open your eyes.

You just sucked 50 dicks.

I'm fine with that.

What are you trying to scare me?

You're never going to scare me.

Close your eyes.

OK.

Open your eyes.

You got it?

You just jerked off two dragons.

OK.

That doesn't phase you at all.

Then if that really happened, I made God amongst men.

I mean, I vanquished you very parable monsters by Jack and the...

Vankers.

Well, when you jack somewhere enough, that's a sign of power over the other person.

Oh.

Don't you know that?

Yes.

You're making another person submit to you.

I haven't found that to be.

If you ever want to show your dominance, jack somewhere enough.

The unflappable Mitch Slocum.

Yes.

I was walking through the field in two horses.

You're parambulating through the field.

Well, I wanted to dumb it down for this freak over here.

I'm sorry.

What would you do?

Anyway, I just, you know.

Anyway, I was working through the field paramulating as it were.

And two horses collided into me.

They were running very fast.

Were they coming at each other?

They had to.

It's hard to say.

I mean, I looked to the left and one horse said, you're next.

And I pointed to me.

And then he pointed no behind you.

The horse talked to you.

And then I turned around.

And then the other horse was like, OK, but he wanted me to me.

And then they run into me.

I tried to get out of the way.

But it was.

How did you try to go out of the way?

Were you trying to parambulate?

I jumped if you both can believe it.

Whoa.

How high?

To try to make that fit into each other?

Yeah.

Well, first I jumped forward and I didn't go anywhere on account of my, as you can see, I don't have legs.

Wait, but wait, hold on.

Hold on.

That was because of the horse.

I cannot see that.

So this isn't how you lost your legs?

No, no, no, no.

This is just another weird thing to have.

A terrible accident.

OK.

This was a terrible accident to feel.

I don't know if you've ever had two horses collide with you.

No, I mean, what you're explaining sounds like horses acting like raptors grouping up and trying to kill you.

Well, just as they were coming, just as they were colliding, I turned to one.

I said, clever girl.

Is that a joke?

I don't believe so.

How are you parambulating to this field without legs?

On my hand.

Anywho, I lost my legs in a terrible, weak combine accident.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, no, I know.

Close your eyes.

OK.

Open your eyes.

You had legs for a little bit.

That doesn't bring me to tears if you're trying to make me emotional that for one second.

I'll get you a motion.

I love that.

Here, I'll tell you what, close your eyes again.

OK.

OK, now try to walk while your eyes are closed.

I don't believe I can.

Open your eyes.

I did nothing.

You fucking idiot.

Oh.

But you tried.

You did try.

Made you try.

I will.

I'll face it.

I know.

I don't believe I did.

I think I was confused.

You did try.

We combine.

Did you work for a company that was threshing me?

No, I was messing around.

I really shouldn't have been there.

OK.

I was putting stones in the gears.

Was this a loose combine somewhere?

Friends combine.

Are you an anti-wheat guy?

I was eight.

What can a boy do?

Oh, yeah.

I put stones in a wheat combine gears.

Play?

Yeah.

Yes.

And the farmer decided to teach me a lesson.

And he waited for me when I was on the gears.

And on the blades.

And he turned it on.

Oh, no.

Wow.

I mean, that's a hard lesson to learn.

I learned it.

You definitely never do that again.

Yeah, I've done it again since.

No, but I am passionate about rocks.

OK.

Passionate about rocks.

Tell us all everything.

I like the like the meh, my wands in the outer space wands in the sediment wands in the ones that flake in the ones that are hard and the ones that are dusty in the ones that shard.

And I like the rocks that go boom boom when I take the rocks and I go zoom zoom down the hill.

I roll them down the hill big or small.

It doesn't matter till they hit the man or a lady or a bus.

I like it when they clang off the bus.

Hey.

Wow.

Was that planned?

That was incredible.

That's what I say at the beginning of all my rock.

Dude from the beginning.

Here we go.

Wait, I can't.

I've got a one limit.

Oh, that makes sense.

It's a rule.

Yeah, that definitely makes sense.

So you're a rock collector.

You're sort of a geologist in a way.

A geologist in the circuit.

I had a couple of geologists on recently who were also singers.

Who?

Name the names.

Brashford.

I know them.

Yeah, yeah.

They're married couple.

Yes.

Yeah.

Yes.

I've been to it.

I've seen them at the Rocky Dimensions.

Yeah, right.

Yeah.

They sing that one song that they barely know.

Yes.

Solid as a rock.

It's also very confusing.

Rock conventions could mean rock and roll music.

Yeah.

How often does that happen where you think you're going to a convention?

It turns out you're going to go with a con.

It's just Def Leppard.

Coachella.

The amount of accidental warp tours that I've been to.

I can't even imagine.

I can't even tell you.

Do you enjoy them though?

Are you kidding me?

Who doesn't like a little ooh?

A little long beach.

All stuff.

Does your ever go as little affair confusing or no?

Like the body, sit the floor.

Oh, wow.

Do you sing?

I try to.

Let's hear a little bit of it.

Um, disrespect your surroundings.

Um, oh, you only know three words from each thing?

Yeah.

Um, I do it all for the gnocchi.

Oh, I know that one, the gnocchi.

Um, let me see.

Corn, you know any corn?

Um, all day I dream about sex.

Is that true?

What?

Are you making a sex?

I'm celibate by choice.

Oh, my goodness.

Wow.

We are polar out.

Why?

We are milk and cereal.

We are so off the cereal.

What milk and cereal, cereal and milk?

There we go.

Oh, cereal and milk.

Milk and cereal, cereal and milk.

You know, we should try that in a round, would you?

Okay, here we go.

You start us off.

So, I think, will I point or you'll just know?

Well, what do we do?

I think it would on milk and...

On and?

Oh, do you like the roll, roll, roll your boat?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You're ready.

I'm ready.

You start us off.

Um, I'll go after.

Milk and cereal and milk.

Wait, do you want me to do a different time?

I'll do it.

Milk and cereal.

Oh, no.

Milk and cereal, cereal and milk.

Milk and cereal and milk.

We almost did it.

I'd like to try again.

Okay, here we go.

I thought you meant make up new words to it.

One, two, one.

Well, I'm laughing.

It's too much fun.

Is that it though?

It's everyone doing, are we in a joke?

Oh, deadly serious.

Dearly serious.

Everyone frowns.

Okay.

So, think of the worst thing that's happened.

So, for me, it's killing all those people in my sperm.

Losing my legs and then getting hit by the horses.

Wait, you just got this show?

Okay, here we go.

Milk and cereal, cereal and milk.

You know, have you ever had a dream in the morning where you can't wake up from?

It's a bit like that.

It's not like this.

It sounds like that's what that sounds like.

That was a lot of fun.

I loved it.

Number eight.

Okay, so they're playing Leonard's stool tap and Mitch Slocum.

I believe I mentioned Brashford and Franklin, not Samson.

I believe it's Bashford and Samson is who I meant to mention when I mentioned Brashford and Franklin, who are from a different episode who may be coming up later on the countdown.

Who knows?

Who can say?

Certainly not I, not the likes of you.

Certainly not.

Only God can say.

Only God can judge us.

Do you think he's out there judging us?

Yeah, I do.

If I know him.

This guy guy?

Very judgmental.

Very judgmental guy.

Like that's all he cares about.

That's all he cares about is creating us.

First of all, he creates us.

Yeah.

To judge us.

Just to judge us.

God, you created us.

Just to judge us.

We are going out of our minds.

It's happening.

We have, look guys, we have one more clip before the end of this episode and before you and I go on a lunch break.

Look, we have one more clip.

But let's, before we do that, we have to go to a break.

Is that all right?

We have to do that.

When we come back, we're going to have episode seven on the countdown.

This is so exciting.

We're really getting to it.

Lucky, slavon.

Lucky, number seven.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang.

Wow.

We're really doing it.

We're t- Scott, we're tearing through this shit.

We're tearing this countdown a new A-hole.

Oh, we're like shit through a goose.

Do goose shit a lot?

Is that why that?

I guess when you're watching a goose, it's just like shit and constantly, right?

They can't hold their grain.

They love grain, but they can't.

They just, it just goes right through them.

It goes right through them like.

Diarrhea, goose.

I don't know.

Diarrhea.

Is it that, I don't know that it's, you know, when you're.

Well said, Scott.

Sliding into home and you're feeling all that foam.

Diarrhea.

He can say it's not so much that they shit all the time.

Why is that?

Can I ask?

Why, what is the convergence of diarrhea and baseball that that rhyme?

You really don't know.

No, I don't know.

No, I don't.

Scott, this is absurd.

Why did that rhyme, who, I don't understand like diarrhea, diarrhea when you're coming into first and you feel your trousers burst, when you're sliding into third and you feel that big turd, although that's the opposite of diarrhea as far.

You know, like why, who was like, we listen, I got an idea.

Let's imagine baseball players have diarrhea.

Now look, I'm a baseball fan.

Sure.

So I know this.

You're Mr. Baseball.

They call me Mr. Baseball.

And this is maybe a little inside of that game.

Sure.

Just like a pitch might be at certain point.

In order to perform at the peak.

At the level these guys are.

The fact of the level.

Yeah.

They all have diarrhea.

Is it because of their dietary?

Yes.

I see.

And the certain medications that one has to take.

Yes.

They're basically all on speed.

Yeah.

They're saying.

Yeah.

Diarrhea speed.

The speed at which diarrhea passes through.

See, that's the thing.

I don't think it's that goose shit all the time.

It's that they shit so quickly.

They're just like, they're just like, there he goes.

Yeah.

So that's what it was.

People were like, looked at that and said, wow, they shit so fast.

Have you ever seen a goose like settled in the magazine on a toilet?

No, you haven't.

No, no toilet for you.

All right, I be.

Oh, Paul, we're really doing it though.

You have to admit.

I am compelled to admit that.

Yes, we are.

The power of Christ compels you to admit that we are really doing it.

The power of Christ compels you.

Why aren't TV preachers really a thing anymore?

There's still there.

Where they parrot it.

So much that people don't take them seriously enough.

They were mortified.

You know how like in the late 80s and early 90s, it was like, yeah, enough parodies of TV preachers.

We know they're CD.

We know they're out there just, you know, they're for money, but it worked.

It did.

It really worked.

I think what happened was TV preachers, when they saw all the comedians make fun of them, they were like, let's lay low for a little bit.

Let an animal comment.

Let people forget all these hilarious parodies.

He's going to become a hacky thing.

And then we'll wait until it will ride out.

And then when people kind of forget about it, we'll be back.

We'll be back.

I meant for that to be.

For that to be in our North Thank you.

We have to get to our final clip of this episode, Paul.

We're going to forget the final.

I can really see it.

Yeah, I'm doing a public.

This is exciting because this is episode number seven.

Number seven.

All right.

Number seven.

This is episode 574, Paul.

The five hundreds are very popular this year.

Not only that, but this is the final episode that was eligible for our countdown.

This is impossible.

From first to last, I believe the Bible tells us.

Bible tells us.

Alpha and the Omega.

524, which was on our previous countdown, Mary Chunky Christmas.

That was not our first episode eligible.

I thought it was from first to last, but it's not.

I think there was one or two before then.

But this is the last episode that was eligible.

This is an episode called Conan.

Never goes outside.

And the parties involved in this are Conan O'Brien.

That's right.

From the titular Tonight Show.

No, of course he has his own show, Conan.

Of course he has.

Paul of Tompkins.

That's me.

Lauren Lapkis.

That's her.

And Mary Holland.

That is also her.

All of these people are involved in this episode.

And this was merely a month ago, I believe, that we recorded this.

It seems like only yesterday, but it was in fact yesterday and then three weeks or so.

Three weeks or so, or maybe four.

Yeah, maybe four.

Of course this is an episode where our label mate, he is on the ear wolf network.

Oh label.

Conan O'Brien was making the rounds, doing some podcasts and agreed very nicely to do ours.

Well, you agreed.

Was he nice about it?

I'm not sure.

I believe he complained about it on a different podcast.

Mmm, seems unlike him.

Well, I have run into Conan a couple of times here and there.

I directed the Between Two Ferns episode.

He was in, which was in the basement of the Tonight Show Theater at Universal Studios when he was there for about six months.

We filmed it in the basement there.

So I'd run into him a couple of times so I don't really know him.

Does anyone?

That's the whole premise of his show.

Oh, yeah.

That he has no friends.

I guess I won't pitch that to him.

Hey, here's a pitch for you.

You got no friends.

Nobody liked you.

But it was a pleasure talking to him.

Actually in these clips that we're going to play, we don't normally play a lot of the interview segment on these clips, but it was such a good interview that I wanted to play some of it.

Why not?

And we talk about the very topic that you and I were discussing not moments ago, SCTV, where he tells John Candy stories.

That's right.

So we are going to play a little bit of the interview.

By the way, if you don't know the, if you're just listening to these episodes for the first time, you don't really know what comedy bang bang is.

Normally the show starts off with a real person and I'm talking to them and I do a little bit of an interview, not too serious about what they're up to and then we bring in fake characters.

So we're going to play a little bit of the real interview with Conan and then we are going to play a section from you and Lauren Lapkis.

We're playing Pat and Scott Hampton craft to Hoteliers.

And after this later, Mary Holland plays a ghost, but instead we're going to hear these first two clips.

This is your episode seven.

Number seven.

Big Beatles fan.

Do you like the Beatles?

What happened there?

Did you just have a small stroke?

Yeah.

How did you get tiny one?

So you've done no preparation.

Oh, absolutely.

You're not even sure who I am.

I think that you are.

You think I'm Bill Burr wearing a wig, don't you?

That's what you think.

Do you think you have more hair than Bill Burr?

I know I have more hair than Bill Burr.

So let's talk about the pie of more hair than Lucille Ball.

Currently.

Oh God, why did you do it?

Why don't you remind us that she's gone?

People need reminding about these facts because otherwise they don't know.

She lives on in our hearts, doesn't she?

She certainly does.

As long as they're on that tube, that flickering screen, they're still alive, I will live long after my death in 11 years, I will still be around because somewhere they'll be showing my show accidentally.

Is that why everything's going up on the web?

You know, because I'm preparing at the end of days.

It must be difficult and this is leading you down another legal avenue here.

How difficult is it to get the rights from the NBC shows?

You're not on NBC?

No, no, that was, that was, it took us a while.

Yeah.

But we, I get along very well with all the people that are there now and it's a joint adventure with them and so let's say putting it up on the web makes us $8.

Right.

They'll get seven of it.

Seven, okay, that's not a great split for you.

I'm not interested in the money, I never was.

You just want people to see it.

I've never been paid for my show.

Really?

Yeah, I've been, I've pretty much been an intern.

So you're the opposite of J-letter who doesn't spend his money, but he gets paid.

If I could get money, I would spend it like crazy.

What would you spend it on?

Oh my God, it's amazing.

I can't, you're the type of celebrity that I can't imagine ever driving down the street.

I don't, when you say celebrity, I don't think of myself as a celebrity.

I think someone that interacts with celebrities.

Interesting.

But I myself don't feel that way.

You do, you, I mean, obviously when you- I'm not in celebrity magazines.

True.

I can't, I defy you to find me.

No paparazzi wants a picture of me.

My plan worked perfectly.

I get to be in comedy and I am completely uninteresting and remain uninteresting to anyone who takes photographs of celebrities.

And yet you probably have all of the annoying aspects of celebrity of, can you go down the street without people wanting to take your picture?

I get a lot of selfie requests.

Right.

Yeah.

How many do you grant?

I grant every single self- 100%!

That's not a joke.

Really?

And why is that?

Do you see your self- It takes a second.

I do it and I know that yourself as a young comedy fan.

I remembered, well I remembered when I was a young comedy, just fanatic and occasionally would meet a hero.

And I was not the kind of person to approach them, but if I did get the chance to, I did get the chance to spend a day with John Candy.

Right.

Who I just idolized.

It was recently the anniversary of his death, I believe.

Or his birthday.

Recently his birthday.

One of the two.

Come on or goin'.

Why you cut in there?

I don't know.

But that was your choice.

And you made it and now we're talking about his death.

Interesting style.

Lucille Ball, him.

Yeah.

But I got to spend a day with him.

I'm gonna keep going.

I got to spend a day with him back in 1984.

And I remembered very clearly that he was everything I wanted him to be.

He was just full of life.

He was false staff.

He was really hilarious.

He was really funny.

And I thought if I ever get the opportunity, I really did think this at the time of ever get the opportunity to do what I would most like to do.

And I'm known for it.

I want to be, when people are a fan and they meet me, I want to show them that it's a real thing.

I don't want it to be artifice.

And no, no, no, that's how I act on TV.

But I'm not really that person.

So that's sort of almost a quasi-religious thing with me.

Can you tell us one example of a story about John Candy where he...

Yes.

In the day.

How many hours are we talking?

You said just a minute.

I got to spend, I was in college at the time and I was running the humor magazine and I invited him to come visit our humor magazine because I just adored him in Boston.

And he said yes, which I couldn't believe.

I picked him up at the airport.

He flew in.

I remembered him to this day.

I remembered him coming down an escalator, holding a paperback that he'd been reading on the plane.

The minute I met him, I thought, oh, don't bring, don't be the nerd who brings up all your favorite SC TV skits.

But he's so friendly.

I started, I just brought up, you know, the yellow belly was a skit where it came with a song, it was a parody of a TV show about a cowardly, it was like his yellow low belly and he's a cowardly cavalry officer who gets discharged for cowardice.

And it just shows him walking down the street and a woman and a little girl walk by and the girl says, I think that's yellow belly and he turns around and shoots them both in the back.

It was the hardest I've laughed as a kid.

You never saw anything that mean, that edgy, and there was a song.

He's a coward.

I brought it up to John Candy and he was delightful and he reenacted it.

And then I had been told by his people, you've got to make sure that John Candy stays on his diet.

He's on a pretty good diet and he sent me back then, I think they had to send it through the mail.

This is back in the 1940s.

But they sent it through pneumatic tube, mail carrier on a horse.

Yes, exactly.

I got this thing and it was like he can have four ounces of boiled chicken, no skin, he can have this, he can have that.

Why have you in charge of this?

Because I was hosting him driving him.

No, no, but I was hosting him for the day.

So they wanted to make sure that I got him all the right food that he needed because he was on this really serious diet.

He was shows up and the first thing he did is he said, hey, let's walk around.

Let's get the feel of the city.

And he was this larger than life really fun guy.

Come on, he kept calling me kid.

Hey kid, come on.

And I was like, oh, all right.

I'm the height I am now, six, four, but I was about 155 pounds and just this big floppy thing of hair and super, it's just super skinny.

I'm like, oh, okay, Mr. Candy.

And I'm walking along with him and the first thing he does is he goes into a pastry shop and he starts pointing to a Claire's in the cabinet and he was like, well, I'll take that one.

I'll take that one.

Give me two of those.

And they start putting all these declares and I'm getting really nervous and I'm really freaking out.

And he looked at me and he winked and he went, don't worry kid, they're pretty kind of Claire's.

And I was like, I'm in a show with him.

I'm in a show with him.

He lived his life like it was a show.

Yes.

Everyone else was the cast.

Yes, exactly.

And I thought that's beautiful.

What a beautiful his life was.

I mean, he was, that's a really special moment for me.

And then recently, not too long ago, I ran into a woman who said, I'm John Candy's, I'm his daughter.

And I remember that you hung out with my dad for a day or that, you know, I've heard you talk about it.

And then she, we exchanged information and then she sent me a photo that her dad took of me.

What?

On campus.

Yeah.

And it's amazing.

Yeah, it's really.

And his, his photo book or he never, or he never threw out any photo.

I doubt it was that important to him.

Wow.

I was, I was just random kid at the time.

Incredible.

And, and do you know, did he, he wasn't so with us in 93 or was he by the time you got your show?

You know, he would, I desperately would have wanted to be a guest, but he passed away just a few months into our show.

Wow.

Yeah.

Well, um, on that note, you're incredible.

I just have to say, sorry, we'll be back to discuss both Kennedy assassinations.

Well, we have to bounce to our next guests.

They are two hoteliers.

And I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly.

Does he want to say, yes, he wants to say, hoteliers?

Or is it always hoteliers?

I'll say that in a wrong.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, do.

Let's welcome them to the show.

This is an exciting opportunity to talk to them.

Please welcome Pat and Scott.

Hampton Crafts.

I really had to read that.

That's a lot of letters in that last name.

We have to write it sometimes.

How do you feel?

Pat and Scott Hampton Crafts.

That's right.

This is Conan Bryan.

Hello.

Nice to see you, Pat.

How do you do?

Which one is Pat?

Which one is Scott?

Well, I'm Scott because I, well, I don't want to.

Cause you, oh, it's scatological.

No.

My whole name's Scott Tricia.

Oh, Scat Tricia.

Okay.

Why would you go down the scatological route with Scat Tricia?

She said it like, well, you know what I mean.

And my full name is Pat Man.

Pat, like Pat Man?

No.

Like Pat Man Cruthers.

Oh, man.

Why are you getting me wrong?

That's where I went too.

I thought he meant like Pat Man Cruthers.

What, I'm sorry.

I've never seen the shining, so I don't know who that is.

Okay.

Welcome to the show, guys.

Thank you for having us, guys.

Thank you so much.

It's a pleasure to be here.

Your hoteliers.

What hotel are you in charge of?

Well, we have nothing exactly a hotel.

Yes.

It's a property that we own that people can pay money to stay in.

I love a good property when I go on vacation.

Conan, do you ever go on vacation?

I mean, you must go somewhere.

I do.

What's your city of choice?

I know of a Scotia.

Nova Scotia.

I only go to Nova Scotia.

There's a small shack there down by the water that I like to visit.

Mm-hmm.

It's very expensive, actually.

Do they keep it open for you year round?

They need to be ready to go at any moment.

Any moment, yeah.

What's in that shack, is it just?

I'd rather not say.

A table, a chair, and one rifle.

Let's just say it looks can be deceiving.

It looks like a very simple shack on the outside.

Inside, it's quite opulent.

It's like the TARDIS.

Yeah, and it goes down many levels.

It's a way for me.

Well, let's be honest.

A world-renowned celebrity to get away.

Now earlier in the show, you were saying you didn't consider yourself to be a celebrity.

And suddenly your world renounced just for saps.

Scott, thanks for having us.

Yeah, and welcome to the show, guys.

I would say I would never, as a host, Pat and Scott, I would never, ever, ever, if you were on a competition between us.

Excuse me.

Oh, I think it has become- I'm sorry, I'm turning your kona.

Yeah, thank you very much, Scott.

Or I'm sorry, Skittrycia, not for Statological.

Skat.

Skatological for sure.

Okay, well now, I would never have, he swivelled his chair away from you and- My chair has been right here the entire show.

I heard a squeaking swivel.

He swivelled it away, looked at me.

I look at both of you and I say, you said it's not a real hotel.

What kind of building is it?

Thank you.

I would take over for me.

I would love to just add color commentary everywhere.

Sure.

You want to do play by play.

Oh, happily.

Okay, very good.

Oh, good.

Well, yeah, we have a home in Sandesky, Ohio.

That's right.

And- Sandesky.

Come on.

Sherry Sandesky.

Good way they've named the city after him.

You said- I had a home parade.

To be fair, they named it long before.

Oh, okay.

They named it long before and they're having- He was named after the town.

Yeah.

They talked about changing the name since then.

Yeah, but it's a whole talk?

That's a bureaucratic mess.

It's too hard to be in that.

It is.

And a lot of pranksters are saying, let's call it paternal Ohio.

Yeah.

It's like that's a lateral movement.

What's that when you get up to date all of your accounts online?

That's where you're at.

That's right.

Everyone would have to fill out a change of address for everyone.

And I'm so impressed.

There's no point.

So we absolutely love it there, of course.

We love it there, of course.

So you have this house.

Is it the house that you consider that the hotel or is it another structure?

It's a structure that we use.

It's a home.

It is a home.

And during the week, so we don't have any customers or patrons as we so love to call, we stay there.

We live there and this is our home.

Yeah.

When is that?

Do we live there?

When we get a customer, patron as we say, we come back like the call-o.

We live.

We move out.

What we do it?

We move out.

We don't move out.

We pack our bags.

First we make sure we don't need every step.

First we wake up.

We wake up.

Eat breakfast.

I'm always hungry.

We both wake up hungry every day.

And now we're brother and sister, which of course we haven't gotten out yet.

So we're very similar in our eating habits.

Now, because when we were born in the room- I think everyone eats first thing in the morning as far as- Well, we had the same mom.

That's right.

We come out starving.

First thing that we are born, we both wanted the tit.

That's right.

We're born too.

Did one of you get left one and one of you get right one?

I got left in the dust.

You've been using that, Jeff.

I got right in there.

You got me.

You've been using that, right?

That's not the first time you've unclunked out one.

It's the first time I've done any of this.

It's true.

We've said all of this before.

You guys are reading this off of script.

Yes, we are.

Yes, and thank you for saying your lines.

We're five people and we have a difficult time with strangers.

Yeah.

And we're both visual learners.

Visual learners.

Guys, do you get written down?

Flashcards.

Flashcards are great.

Yeah.

Do you provide a service when people stay with you as a hotel would?

Yes, we do.

Turn down, turn up.

Mm-hmm.

So you turn down service and...

Turn down the TV, turn up the sheets.

That's right.

So you turn the TV all the way down?

Yeah.

When people say we need turn down service...

We'll do what you want.

We'll have to turn down for what?

And then they have to be very specific.

Is that how that song started?

What song?

Oh, you don't know about that song.

Actually, I made a song about it.

Oh, okay.

It goes like this.

Oh, I was waiting to debut at the show.

You got your debut in front of me, surprise.

You love some plays?

This is a debut of a song.

You know what the spit is flying in this room.

It really is.

No one can see...

A lot of people don't know this.

We're almost 10 years into the show and I've been spat upon so much.

I need a salad guard of something.

We both just got braces.

You'll have to forget that.

Well, yeah, so you have to understand.

I actually...

What I would got is this guard, but the base of my piece that blocks my tongue from going forward.

What I have is very difficult to talk.

I just got some old-fashioned metal braces, like from a museum.

They have leather bands.

So let's hear the song.

I guess it goes like this.

Turn down for what?

I haven't figured out the rest yet.

Oh, wait, that's the end.

That's the beginning of the end.

Yes.

All right.

I think you got a good start there, though.

Well, thank you.

This is why you're very supportive and this is why our family works so well together.

Exactly.

And why we decided to live together in the first place.

Yes.

You know, we moved out.

Have you ever lived apart or did you move back in with each other?

I moved out at one point.

You stayed home with Mommy.

Yes, I did.

I came home with Mommy.

Is Mommy still around?

Mommy passed.

Mommy's past Conan.

Mommy passed Conan.

That doesn't always necessarily mean that she's dead.

I mean, people use that in full-time.

In entertainment.

I've been, yeah, a past can also mean career on the way.

You know what I mean?

A lot of people question, you know, who's past has Conan passed.

Oh, you know, but is she dead?

Well, yes, she has passed.

She has passed, but her career did.

They died first.

Whoo!

Was she an entertainer?

Absolutely.

Yes, she certainly was.

She was a stage magician.

Yes.

Never took it to television.

No, no, no.

The TV wasn't invented.

Oh, this was before the 30s or so?

Yes.

Yes, our ages.

Okay.

We won't be offended.

I would imagine.

We've heard it all.

I would imagine you must be around 80 or so.

Yeah.

What do you think?

I think you're getting warmer.

Uh-oh, it's getting warmer.

When they walked in, I have to say, Scott, I'm not, when they first walked in, I thought, I almost stood and said, thank you for your service in the Korean War.

To them both.

And I thought that might be presumptuous.

Presumptuous or like saying to a woman, oh, a baby's on the way and sure.

You'd be shocked.

One of the most insulting things you could feel.

If you'd said, thank you for ensuring the Korean War.

What if I'm like, I'm walked in here.

Yeah, but if you said, thank you for being pregnant, I'm 85, I'd think.

Nope, that's just my hard belly.

Oh.

So you're not pressing on to say that?

No, Scott, it's my hard old lady belly.

You only got a rock hard belly.

Rock hard distended.

Is it okay if I feel it?

I mean, I'm asking.

I just want to make sure everyone knows that I'm not going to.

Feel it?

Oh my God.

That is...

See?

That is, well, that was a very fake sound.

But yeah, that's exactly how it...

The way it sounded is just how it felt.

It's right up and I keep stuff inside.

Oh my God, look at that.

There's some sort of trap door in there.

Crazy.

Like a marsupials pouch.

Yep.

You want to see what do I got this time?

Oh, can I guess?

Yeah.

Alarm clock.

Nope.

Polypockets.

What is it?

Polypockets.

What is polypockets?

It's an old toy from the 90s.

Or you'd open up a little shell and she'd be inside there.

So you're very old, but you refer to something from the 90s as being old.

Yeah.

I turn it over to you, lawyer.

Well, it's one of those really old toys.

From the 90s.

When I was 70, our mother forbade us to have toys until we were in our 50s.

Let's see.

Why do we have fun?

Oh, well, we finally got to play with a little...

A shoe, a hoop, a hoop, a hoop, a hoop, a stick.

A hoop, a stick.

Somewhere around 1988, you finally got to play with toys.

Yeah.

Ball and Jack.

Strawberry shortcake.

Jack.

Cabbage patch kids.

Yep, alibis.

Slime.

Flome.

FOMO.

Why are you here?

Yeah, I was going to ask.

Okay, so you did like that interview question.

Well, I thought in a way it was refreshing because it's like he opened a window and just this gust of air came in.

Why are you here?

You're too a hotel, yay.

Speaking of opening a window.

Where did he tell you?

We're opening up our house for services.

That's right.

Which includes windows.

The doors, windows.

That's a pretty good segue.

And you will leave.

Where do you go when you leave the house?

The same question.

Exactly.

Let's say I check in and where do you guys go?

We evacuate.

You evacuate.

We evacuate.

We evacuate our ball.

That's a cool way.

Then we do that first.

I take a big dump.

Not so confused with my name.

And then we leave.

We leave.

You leave them with a dump.

No, I flush the toilet.

Of course it's in the toilet.

Okay, but the toilet for each other.

Of course it is.

The general environment is such that a dump has recently been evacuated.

Sorry, sir.

You can say that about any plate.

Yeah, I'm where you go.

I'm only right too.

I guess so.

So we evacuate.

Of course we have to stay on the premises though because in case anything goes wrong.

That's right.

Where do you stay?

You stay on the premises in a guest house?

Yes, exactly.

You have complete freedom in the house.

You have to stay in your own entrance.

That's right.

You have your own bed?

You have your own front door?

You have your own back door?

And if you don't look out the back door, you won't see us?

You're right outside the back door.

Right outside there.

No, it's connected to the door and it's actually a room.

Yes.

In the house.

So it's in a joining room?

Yes.

So it's not detached.

But there's a glass door in the kitchen.

You can see right in front of it.

It's separated.

If it leads into, I'm sorry, but if it leads into another room, it's technically not the back door.

There's a door that leads into, I'm sorry, but that's just the truth.

No, no, I understand.

No, you're the lawyer.

People get confused about this a lot.

They get confused about who's the lawyer and who isn't.

What is it?

There's a very thin strip of backyard.

It's a very thin strip.

Very thin strip.

Perfect.

How thin?

Like a Brazilian wax.

A Brazilian wax had a pussy.

Yes, exactly.

You said it first.

Hold on, Scatresha.

I didn't say that.

You said it.

He said Brazilian wax, but you didn't say pussy.

You said pussy.

Okay, I would not have a Brazilian wax.

Yeah, it's a citizen eyebrow.

Scat, I'm sorry, but for a 92-year-old woman, I find some of your language offensive.

Well, I've been on the surf long enough.

I can do whatever I want.

I feel like she earned the right she is a realtor.

She is a salty language.

Look, you want to say anything bad?

I'm open for it.

Wow, you're sort of coming on to me.

That's the vibe I'm getting, Scat.

Hey, take it guys, you will.

My brother here likes to interpret everything I do as coming on, not to him, of course, when he thinks I'm a big flirt.

You are a big flirt.

No, I'm not.

You've never been married?

Well, no, I haven't.

I've been married for 35 years.

And he's still with her.

Isn't that beautiful?

Yeah, I will.

I assumed when he said that, indeed.

Where does she live?

She lives in her home.

Yes.

And you two, you live with your sister.

Well, of course I do.

Okay, but you've been married.

Have you ever consummated the marriage?

Have you consummated the marriage?

You mean fuck?

Okay, if you're going to- Say it plainly, come in.

I thought I was talking to Scat for a second.

Look, we're folks.

We've been others for a long time.

We know what you say, Cass, you mean fuck.

That's right.

You don't have time to mince words.

No, no time.

It's like a great comedian, what's said.

You know, if you say the word consummate, that just makes me think the word fuck.

So why don't you just say the word fuck?

Who is that, the bells?

Look at the K.

No, that was Bob Newhart.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh, you beat Louis C.K. fans?

I love his early stuff.

Not so much easily.

Um, not yet.

Number seven.

Ah, good clips.

Good clips to us all.

Good clips to all of you and to all a good clip.

And good clips to you too and to all your family too.

And God bless you and have you in your world.

I still remember my, I think I was the baritone in our four person acapella group that would wander the Sacramento mall and sing, uh, dressed in, of course, Dickensian garb.

Of course.

Uh, I as notorious power bottom, Epinuser Screws.

But I still remember my baritone parts of all of those songs.

But I think we had a repertoire of probably 15 songs that we would wander around doing.

And I still remember and God bless you and have you a happy new year, which is the baritone party.

I talked about this on another podcast.

We got this with my friends.

Well, where do you hear?

You won't be upset with my with, uh, our friends, Hal Lublin and Mark Gagliardi.

They have a podcast called We Got This where they settle.

They try to determine, you know, the, um, you know, settle arguments to determine the best of this, that and the other thing.

Right.

And so we were doing an episode about, uh, uh, the best, the best songs for Christmas caroling, not the best Christmas carol, but the best song for Christmas caroling.

Right.

Not the best Christmas carol.

Yeah.

Not the best person who played notorious power bottom, Epinuser Screws.

That's right.

Not the best part of the movie carol that came out around Christmas time.

Right.

No.

And, uh, I was reminded of, um, when I was in high school and we did the, was it, I think it was Annie, get your gun.

Annie, get your gun.

That's right.

Just squeeze musical.

Yeah.

I'm the squeeze.

There's a song, there's a song in it called, I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night.

I don't know that one.

I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night.

And so we, I was, my character was in the chorus for that.

It's a whole big group number.

And periodically, I remember out of nowhere that we had to say what point, sun morning and moon night.

That's all I remember.

Good morning and moon night.

But the great Natalie Walker, who is a terrific, uh, actress.

Yes.

Didn't you do a show in New York?

That's right.

She gets us my destination.

Uh, you sang.

You sang shallow together.

Yeah.

Um, she posted a video, uh, either last Christmas or a couple of Christmases ago.

Last Christmas.

She posted a video.

That's right.

She, uh, sang just the, uh, the alto part to her school's arrangement of, uh, that morang carry Christmas on.

Right.

Yes.

I enjoyed that.

It's very, very recently, a bunch of kids did that.

Did on stage.

They did just that part.

Just the alto part.

Yes.

Of the song.

Yeah.

And I, I love that.

I think we did that on what I did for love.

Maybe, uh, the chorus line when I was in, in choir.

Uh huh.

I think it was like, go.

Love is never gone.

As we travel on.

That's beautiful.

It really is.

I don't even need to hear the rest of the song.

Did you, when you were in choir, did, did you, I mean, this is how you drum those melodies into you is, is you, you work with a piano player and they, they plunk out just to your part and you have to memorize just your part.

I, okay.

I, I've for years and I still, cause I still work with Evan Schleider and, and try, in order for me to learn a harmony, I have to, um, listen to it over and over and over again.

Like I'm, like I'm being brainwashed in a cult.

Right.

Yes.

I have to, there's no other way.

I, I don't pick up on them quickly.

Right.

And so Evan will like sometimes try to give me a note if we're rehearsing or something.

Right.

It's like, that doesn't, that doesn't help me at all.

Right.

But it's, it, yeah.

A pitch pipe sort of works for me.

It is interesting though, because if you hear it along with everyone else's part, it's very difficult to learn.

Yeah.

And then you have to hear it like it's like it's the melody of the song.

So we gotta keep them separated.

Hey, hey, hey, oh, give it to me, baby.

All right.

We're going to be counting down the top offspring songs.

I think we just did.

Numbers one and two with the bullet or with respect to bullets.

All right.

We need to close this out.

It's getting to be lunchtime for us.

And it's the end of the episode for the rest of you.

It's pretty fly for a white guy.

We are going to have two episodes next week where we countdown the top six.

On Monday, we will be counting down six, five and four.

And then on Thursday, the following Thursday, three, two and one.

What could they be?

Contact.

Do you want to tell you right now?

The feeling.

You don't know.

I keep the secret.

It's the motion.

You think I didn't heck in your fucking phone, bro?

Whoa.

Yeah.

I'm a phone hacker.

I'm Jack in the name frame.

I'm on it.

Yeah.

Straight days.

All right.

We got to go, but we will see you on Monday, New Year's Eve for the rest or for the continuing part of our countdown part three from Paul F. Tomkins and myself.

We.

Maybe it's just too early in the game.

Oh, but I thought I'd ask you just the same.

What are you doing New Year's New Year's?

We have to.

All right.

See you then.

You I'm going to go back to the next slide.
