♪♪♪ Nothing steams my beans more than dad's ass and damn jeans.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Thank you to Jonathan Chungus for that cash-free submission, Jonathan Chungus.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

A very special week.

This is the 13th anniversary episode.

Yes, we have been going at least once a week for 13 years now.

And something else to celebrate.

We are back in the studio.

We're back in the earwool studios.

We have four walls around us as well as a ceiling.

And the most important one of these surfaces, this floor.

So we don't fall straight to the center of the earth.

Welcome to the show.

We have a great one.

A lot of great people are going to be on the show.

My name is Scott Ocherman, of course.

We have some incredible guests on the show.

Coming up a little later, we have a social media expert who gives tips.

We have a punk rocker.

We have a visual artist of sorts in a way.

And we also, you know, it wouldn't be an anniversary episode if we didn't have a special musical guest, as Don Pardo said on Saturday Night Live.

Please welcome Torkel and Amy from STARS, the entire band stars.

Hi, guys.

Hello, world.

Hello, America.

Hello, people who like funny things.

All the ships at sea.

Yes.

So good to have you guys back on.

It's a great pleasure, sir.

The new record is called from Capleton Hill.

Is that how you pronounce it?

Correct.

That's it.

You do it.

Where is Capleton Hill?

It's just like it's a place I've gone every summer in my life.

My mother went every summer.

It doesn't change.

It never changes.

Like nothing ever.

They can't ever build there because there's so many crazy building laws.

And all the shops are the same.

And it never grows.

And it just never changes.

And everything changes.

Everything is so annoyingly changing constantly, more often than not for the worse.

And this, so from Capleton Hill, it's just the idea of like, there's a place that doesn't change.

And it's in your head.

Well, that's fantastic.

You have this great new album.

You're going to be doing songs from the new record here for us.

Very special.

We are.

For our anniversary episode.

We are so excited to play here.

Is this the anniversary in the sense?

It's the first time you did a show was on this date 14 years ago?

Yes, 13 years ago.

Well, we're starting our 14th year.

So this is our 13th anniversary.

Yes.

Wow.

So yeah.

Congratulations.

That's awesome.

Thank you so much.

Yeah.

I mean, you guys have been together longer.

I mean, 22 years.

We're, yeah.

So obviously we're.

Yeah, 22 years.

It's much better.

We're back with you.

But it's not a competition.

I think it is.

Oh, if you win, it's a competition.

OK.

Correct.

But you guys are going to be here the entire show doing song sports.

And we'll check back with you a little bit later.

But first, let me introduce.

He's been on the show now for a few years.

He is a basketball legend.

He is a fellow broadcaster, which is why I want him coming in here in A-block in the co-host slot.

Please welcome back to the show Bill Walton.

Hello, Bill.

Oh, yeah.

13 and feeling me.

It's got to be on your phones, everyone.

Turn down your phones.

Wow.

How are you, Bill?

Oh, what a fantastic day.

What a fantastic 13th year.

I cannot wait.

I have already mangled my microphone stand.

You spoke so loud, the microphone stand broke.

Is that what happens?

An old cartoon is when people sang opera, glasses would shatter.

When I speak, microphone stands go slightly awry.

This is one of the great anniversaries, is it not?

One of the best anniversaries.

He just said to you up here.

One of the best I've ever seen from the silver anniversary, which is one of my favorites.

Two.

Oh, let's see that today.

I know we all need to help out.

We all need to chip in the anniversary party.

Oh, yes.

One of the great slow-played marvels of theater.

The fan written by, I believe, the fantastic.

Let me pull this name out real quick.

He did betrayal.

He's not a house painter, but you take off a letter, and he's a house painter.

Oh, I'm sorry, no, in the painter word.

Oh, yes.

Harold Paint, one of the great.

And we take a quick beat as the jokes would do if you're in the theater school.

Harold Pinter.

Pause.

One of the great painters.

Yes, one of the great painters.

But he did not paint houses.

He painted emotional trauma onto stage, as played by some of the fantastics.

Not Joel Gray, of course.

Oh, one of the great grays!

From 50 Shades of To, From 50 Shades of To, to Zanademy.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Did she play Meiji?

Oh, anatomy is Meiji.

Bill, it's so good to see you.

It's great having you here.

What have you been up to, Kai?

Happy to be here.

Well, we just exited March Madness.

The commercials were on one this year.

I was loving the commercials.

And we're into the NBA playoffs, and they didn't make any new ones.

So we're stuck with the old all-stated AT and D commercials, so we would want it.

Put it on for days!

Are you broadcasting?

Are you announcing any of the games?

They will have me in the national games.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Just the regionals.

Just the regionals, and I accept it as the fate of a man who challenges social norms on Mike.

Right, yeah.

I mean, are you out there wearing the tie-dye shirts?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, we're tie-dye.

I'll wear my bikini.

Oh, I'll give a kitty.

Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Ha, ha, ha.

I wear my bikini.

Because you got to show everybody that this is a fun thing we do basketball.

Yeah, basketball is fun.

The game is fun.

It is meant to be joyful.

It's just a few boys throwing a little round thing into a bigger round thing.

But as we discussed earlier, the most orange ball.

Yes.

In sports?

Scott, did you see March Madness this year?

I missed all of March Madness.

I didn't see a word.

I heard the March Madness of your own, did you not?

Sorry, do you mean COVID?

Ha, ha, ha.

Yes, you had the March Madness that now goes year round for everyone.

But they made the ball oranger this year.

I saw that some people sent that to me.

I was so excited.

I thought there was, the first thing I did is I called the ESP, or the TNT color correct guy.

And I said, you bumped the orange just too much, bro.

And he said, I don't do color correct on live games.

I said, I'm in the state.

There's a five second delay, so the person can constantly do color correct it.

A fantastic suggestion, because if you watch something, if you go from the bright, beautiful courts of the Charlotte Hornets and then you switch your TV over to the Brooklyn Nets, you feel like you went into a sepia game and you need a little color correct and not confuse your little peepers.

Can it get even more orange is the question?

Because they've pumped it up almost as far as they can go as they say in Oklahoma.

Oh, oh.

Well, to me, that's a Hadron Collider situation.

Yes.

Do we want to touch the untouchable?

Do we want the ball to get so orange that we could, the earth could be sucked unto itself inside of a Wilson basketball?

That's a good, good, Wilson.

Weird that it was a volleyball but named Wilson.

Oh, wait, but they make Wilson.

They make volleyball.

So is that what it was?

After the movie, they had to start.

I was like, oh, man, we're leaving money on the table.

Well, Bill, it's so great to have you.

Are you going to be my co-host?

Is that all right?

I am home.

I want to three.

Scott Oxen, Bill Welton.

He.

So now, Bill, are you ready to bring on our first guest?

I would be happy to do that.

OK, well, he is a visual artist, and he works within the medium of bubbles.

Wow.

If it's Kirby, I'm going to lose my damn shit.

Kirby meaning your enthusiasm?

Oh.

Kirby, you're enthusiasm.

I can't even say it the right way.

Wrong way.

No, Kirby is a little pink fat guy who you might select him in Super Smash Bros.

Oh, yes.

You know, it's not.

No, it's not.

It's not Kirby.

No, I'm so sorry.

And I apologize to the listeners as well.

It's actually Big Chunky Bubbles.

What a typical introduction for me.

Happy anniversary.

Lucky 13.

Many hamburgers to you, of course.

Many hamburgers to you.

Big Chunky Bubbles.

That's my name.

I feel like I haven't spoken to you since perhaps a live episode three years ago before the pandemic.

I don't keep track of when I talk to you.

Surprise, surprise.

Who do you keep track of that you talk to?

Well, my wife, my kids.

Give me the stats on your wife's chats.

Well, you know she's passed.

Oh, that's right.

What happened there?

But I still talk to her.

Oh, I see.

Do you make a trip out to the graveyard or do you just do it around the house?

Oh, fuck.

Which answer would you like to make fun of more?

Mr. Sensitive.

I just find it interesting that most people, you know, they think that if they're not in the graveyards, you know, like 10 feet radius of the actual.

How do you 10 feet?

What are you?

Who's feet?

Six feet, sorry.

Who's standing six feet away from the grave to talk to it?

I mean, meaning they're six feet down.

What?

Six feet under my dear boy.

Yeah, I get that.

One of the great series finales of all time, wouldn't you say, Scott?

Sure.

Six feet under.

Right.

Oh, from the end of Lost, which we all loved to the beginning of Lost, which was a finale to my free time on Tuesday nights.

Yeah.

So big junkie bubbles.

We have how is your pandemic?

We haven't spoken since before.

How is my pandemic?

Yes.

What do you want me to ask?

Have you gotten less good at interacting with people since quarantine?

You're trying to say that, of course, it was bad.

And so why am I leaving?

Of course it would.

Well, that's not strictly true.

It was actually pretty good for me.

So that needs a good question.

Shut up.

Why was it good for you, big junkie bubbles?

Because I was, you don't have to say my whole stage name every time.

All right.

I'm sorry, P.C.D.

You can call me P.D.

That's my name.

Oh, yeah.

P.D.

I mean, P.D.

I mean, yes.

P.D.

First of all, before we go into how your pandemic was, which I hear is pretty good, you're for new listeners, you are a and there can't be new listeners to this.

No, we're just shedding listeners like the virus, like the uterine lining.

You are a you are a person.

Why is that the first thing you think of when I hear the word shedding?

I don't have a period.

Why should I be thinking that?

Why is that rattling around in your not?

I don't like it.

Oh, big junkie.

Everyone should be sympathetic to the shedding of the uterine lining.

Yeah.

It affects at least half of the world's population.

Well, it affects the other half of when you can have sex or not.

Oh, and a little less about Scotty boy, not for Bill Walton.

I'm in there with a tight shed or not.

It's not about sympathy.

It's just I don't want to think about it all the time.

All the time.

What the hell would I hear the word shedding?

How many times are people saying shedding?

I don't know a lot.

I know a lot of people who have snakes.

OK, that's another thing that I want to talk to you about at some point, but not today.

Sure.

But you are an artist.

You perform at children's parties.

I'm a children's entertainer.

And you what what distinct you were you going to make?

I can't remember if you've performed at adult parties either, but you you simply do children parties.

And you you entertain them by making giant bubbles.

They're big chunky bubbles.

That's right.

But that I make out of soups and stews.

Instead of soaps.

And I maybe there's a stews parallel as well.

Instead of soaps and soaps.

I don't know, but you really don't.

You're making soups and stews.

I yes, I'm making soups and stews.

Then I make bubbles from those soups and stews.

They are bigger and junkier than any other people.

That's right.

And I know it is.

It doesn't go well.

You've scalded.

Hey.

How many children have you scalded with?

I have never well.

With your piping hot suits.

I have hardly ever scalded in anyone.

Because I issue warnings at the top of the performance for people to stay back.

Also, I know what I'm doing.

It's my trade.

Right.

Yeah.

So how many how many people how many.

Five.

That's not bad for a whole career.

At least.

That's not bad for a whole career.

At one party or at five different parties?

At five, at three different parties.

Three different parties.

So two at two of those parties.

You want me to give you the breakdown?

Yes, please.

Well, it would have to be two at one party.

Okay.

Two at another party.

Yeah.

One at the final party.

Yeah, what I said.

Yeah, exactly.

Okay.

At the final party.

Congrats.

Did you say the final party or are you not doing this?

The final party where somebody got scalded.

I am still in business.

You are.

Yeah.

So tell me about the pandemic.

What happened?

Why was it so great?

Well, at the wet markets in WUWA.

Oh, dear.

Oh, boy.

Wait, how much do you know?

Zero.

I mean, I know that the pandemic, they say it started there.

Well, the thing about wet markets is there's a lot of bubbles.

And bubbles pop.

I didn't think about that.

No one ever does.

So you were there?

No.

What?

What happened?

What do you mean what?

Do you not know anything about the pandemic?

I was thinking that you were saying you were the person who brought it over here to the state.

Why would I?

Hey, let's say I was.

Why would I tell anyone?

So what are you trying to say?

I thought you were just completely ignorant of what happened.

Oh, I see you were going all the way back to the dance.

God damn it.

I hate you.

I hate you too.

Why did you come here?

I don't.

You know what makes things hard for me.

Because I'm trying to promote my business always, always be promoting a B.C.

But I'm going to have a B.C.

episode.

All right.

I figure maybe other people will be checking back in.

They haven't listened in a while.

They're like, did it get me better?

So why was it good for you?

Because of Zoom.

I was doing so many Zoom shows.

It's so much easier because I don't have to go to somebody's house and set up my terrines and pots.

And I can just do it in my own home.

That's right.

And there is no fear of injury when it's over Zoom other than to yourself.

Yes, as in as you know, my arms are completely burned.

Completely burned.

Yes.

What are you wearing over them today, by the way?

You usually have- A shirt.

Well, sometimes you have those like long fingerless gloves as well.

Like I don't know what you're talking about.

Do they think those fingerless long like sexy gloves in fingerless?

Like opera gloves?

No, I'm thinking of like when you're a dancer, sometimes they would take leg warmers and put them around their arms.

Why would I do that?

Because you're an entertainer.

That was almost a circle.

Why would I do that?

How many things are almost a circle in the world?

How many are almost a circle?

More than you think.

Yeah.

One, two, three.

Steffy graph, almost a font, almost a circle.

Yeah, just two steps removed.

So you were doing Zoom's and were you getting a lot of them?

I mean it's- Yes, people were bored out of their minds.

Right.

And word got around.

I briefly went viral in Turkey.

Wow.

I have a lot of Turkish fans.

Okay.

So you did a lot of work over the pandemic.

This is great, but now that it's- I mean I don't want to say it's winding down necessarily, but we were back in the studio and people aren't doing- I know that people aren't doing as many Zoom's as they did that first couple of months.

Are you still- Are you getting out there and doing them in person?

I am doing some in person shows.

Of course with the distance that I require, it makes it a little more- It makes the show less fun because people are so far away they can't really get the full range of the bubble that I'm making.

Yeah, how far away do people need to be?

60 feet.

60 feet away.

That seems- Yeah.

That was the recommendation.

60 feet.

So yeah, I mean other than if you were to supply every party goer with an iPad and you were live streaming it from your own camera or something like that.

Why wouldn't I just give them binoculars?

That's cheaper.

Maybe you have a bunch of iPads lying around, but I don't.

I actually do.

That's my other show.

Well that's fantastic.

I'm not one of these out of touch entertainers.

Right, yeah I know how much milk costs.

How much does it cost?

A $10.

For how much?

For a lot.

I have to buy a lot of milk to make some of my stews and chowder.

That's right and you're making them from scratch.

You're not just buying them out of the can.

I make them all from scratch and look, you're not supposed to eat them.

The ones that I make.

Right, because they're more viscous or- They're designed for showbiz, they're not designed for taste or nutrition.

Right, and are these your own recipes or are these passed down to you?

Some are mine, some are my grandmothers.

Really, who is grandmother bubbles?

Or grandmother amine.

Grandma mom amine?

Grandma mom amine.

Yes, that's what we would call it.

My other grandma was named Mrs. Doubtfire.

Really?

No relation to the movie.

Based on a book, did you know that?

By...

Sapphire?

I...

Mrs. Doubtfire.

Based on the novel.

Peace on the novel.

Woo!

By Sapphire.

I found out that was based on a book and it blew my mind.

Crazy.

What was the book?

Yeah.

I hope that Robin Williams still did five minutes of impressions of cartoons at the top.

Yes, where they've already animated the entire cartoon and then he has to come in and do the voice.

And then they say stop improvising.

We've already done the cartoon.

And he still doesn't get it, even though it's his job.

So congratulations.

I mean, the fact that you went viral with these non-edible soups.

Is that ever a problem where someone eats a soup after a bubble pops and you're like, no, no, no, you're not supposed to.

After a bubble pops and you think they're gasping at the air like a fish on the land?

I can only imagine that the droplets fly out much like the COVID droplets fly in our shed.

Well, thankfully I've stopped using bat in all my recipes.

Oh, yes.

Okay.

Yeah, there was a period.

For Halloween, I wouldn't make a bat chowder.

Well, big chunky bubbles.

It's a pleasure to have.

You're already winding down.

What else do you have?

What else do I have?

We went through so many detours.

Thanks to you talking about my grandmothers.

Let's get to what you want to get to.

That's what I want to let people know.

I've started doing shows for grownups.

Yes.

This is unprecedented.

You've never done this.

That's right, Bill.

If you come to one of my shows, I'll make sure to stack up eight regular chairs for you to sit on.

Oh, baby, baby.

I gotta say, it will or not, those soups are going in my mouth the second before the game.

No, sir.

Try and stop me.

Well, I've started making new bubbles that...

New shapes of bubbles?

New shapes.

Oh, okay.

Better.

Only suitable for adult hot.

Oh, these are a little salty.

Boy.

Well, they're definitely salty.

I mean...

You're soups, aren't you?

I don't know why I still season them.

I don't need to.

Yeah, since they're not edible.

But what shapes are these?

The mind's reels when I think about it.

Well, I mean, you can imagine some of them right.

Like giant balls?

Yes.

I mean, most bubbles look like giant testicles.

But when you put two together, but the secret is you can have them interlock because that's just two bubbles that are interlocking.

You have to make it, the two bubbles have the same relationship to each other that human testicles would.

Right.

Okay.

Do you ever do just one ball and you're like, this is Hitler and you get a big laugh?

Why would I ever introduce Hitler into the show?

Because you're a weirdo, BCB.

I'm a weirdo?

I haven't mentioned Hitler to you once.

Seems a little weird.

Like you're a denier or something.

A denier.

Of what?

Hitler would have come up.

Hitler never existed.

No, of the Holocaust.

There's no such guy.

He's like Jeepers creepers or whatever.

Well that's incredible.

And how have they been going over?

I mean, is the purpose of this to titillate and to make people, I don't know how else to say it, but horny while they are watching your show?

I mean, that's not the purpose.

To me, it's no different from a great painting of the human form.

It's not supposed to make you what you said.

It's supposed to make you appreciate art, but unfortunately that is not the case and it makes people very aroused.

Really?

Yes.

This is like an aphrodisiac though.

I mean, I guess in the way that pornography is?

Yeah.

Pornography is maybe the best aphrodisiac.

It's number one with a bullet.

Well, this, look, I'm not telling you how to market things, but I think you're going to though.

And sell this to people who want to start an orgy, people in the lifestyle, people who want to do a sex party.

What do you mean sell it to them?

Like a kit?

No, no, meaning you go perform this to them and then that gets them in the mood and then everyone just starts taking it.

Now I know you think you have an idea of what an orgy is and who's going to be there?

I have a vague one.

Yeah, but let me tell you something.

In reality, you don't want to go to all these things.

Really?

Yeah.

Big chunky buttholes.

Thank you, Bill.

I appreciate that.

Are there non-butthole orgies where you're like, okay, everyone just cover your buttons.

We don't want to see you talking like the cats cut.

Yeah, exactly.

Non-butthole orgies.

Like everyone just put a patch over those.

Like a sign at the door?

Yeah, exactly.

We're at Quincy Jones.

Remember, we are at the door.

Yes, maybe you're at the door.

Maybe he goes at the door.

Do you think anyone did?

I don't know.

I mean, it seemed like everyone had a good time.

We're talking about the We Are The World video, by the way.

Oh, yeah.

What did the great bring togethers of all the big celebs from Live Aid to a buttholes party?

So what has happened at these parties?

People just get too turned on and an orgy breaks out?

Is that what you're...

Not an orgy breaks out, but certainly people start to neck.

Oh, okay.

I don't think that's the worst thing in the world at an adult party.

It is when you're trying to perform a show and nobody's paying attention.

I guess so.

I also disagree.

I think people necking around me is worse than if they just started fucking.

Like, what's going on?

There is something that's gross about people really kissing each other.

Yeah.

And you're just standing there and they're going at it.

Yeah, kissing like the...

You kiss in the first three months of your relationship and then you never do again.

You just never again.

Although my wife and I, we kissed passionately for the entirety of our life together.

I'm so sorry.

Did she pass away again?

I don't remember.

I sorta remember it was...

I think it was my fault.

I think it was astute.

It was astute related death.

I think you've properly grieved.

If you can forget how your loved one died, it means it's not over.

One day you'll realize you've just forgotten how she died.

Shut up!

Of course, I saw the miserable children we laid together.

How old are they?

Robbie, Bobby, and Tag.

Oh, right.

Tag.

Tag was the youngest.

Is that right?

Yeah, he was an accident.

Sorry, I'm surprised.

And how old are they now?

Because I haven't seen you in three years, I think.

They're three years older than before.

Okay, great.

Congratulations to you.

Thanks.

Are they...

Have any gone to college or anything like that?

None.

Are they of age though?

No.

Oh, okay.

So there's two.

I'm not going to tell you their age.

I know you.

What do you think I'm going to do with their age?

Ah, you're going to make fun of their ages.

I'll never tell.

Who are you?

Brittany Murphy?

Huh?

I'll never tell.

Well, I remember that.

That's the only thing I remember from that movie.

I don't think I saw it.

Scott hasn't seen it.

Oh, I saw it.

Oh, you did, really?

I couldn't even tell you the name of it.

I feel like it's an O word?

I don't know.

It's not gothaca, but it looked like gothaca.

It was grand.

Yeah, that font.

Oh, yeah.

Gothaca, Hallie Berry.

Yeah, with a beautiful cover of Behind Blue Eyes from Fred Durst and Company.

Oh, are you a Durst fan?

Oh, are you kidding me?

One of the great friends of all time from Scooby's best friend to a Mercury.

Was that his name, Fred?

E Mercury?

Yes.

I've been saying it wrong this whole time.

Yes, you was out for the Neubens brother.

Oh, really?

He's also one of the great Durst of all time from the San Francisco comedian Will to murderer Robert.

Yes.

One kills on stage and the other kills anyone who found out they killed before.

And one kills someone's hopes of getting the million dollar prize on who wants to be a millionaire.

Oh, that was Wilder's.

Okay, Wilder's.

Yeah.

He gave the wrong answer.

So confident too.

As a phone a friend.

Well, Robert, this used to go to those and always do the wrong answer in the ass, the audience.

He was such a fucker.

Yeah.

That's the worst thing he ever did, right?

Ask them all, of course.

Well, Petey, now I'm winding down?

Is that all right?

Yeah, sure.

All right, we have some other guests.

Listen, I want everyone to know.

I'm doing these shows at American Legion halls across the country.

Only American Legion halls.

Only at American Legion halls.

Is that a budgetary issue or you just?

What are you trying to say?

Nothing, sir.

Did you work on it?

I like this.

Is this how you would prefer to be talked to?

I don't hate it.

Well, don't get used to it.

Because I did immediately.

Yeah.

We have to get some other guests.

Can you, I hate to say this, but can you stick around?

I have to.

You have to, for what reason?

I called a ride share service and they won't be here for another two hours.

Oh, no!

Which one is this?

It's...

You've heard of Uberpool.

Sure, yeah.

This is Uber bus.

Oh, god, they're picking up a lot of people.

They're picking up a lot of people.

And you're at the tail end.

It's better than being at the front end, right?

I like riding on the bus.

I'm talking about a human centipede.

Well, you certainly changed it up in a hurry.

Yeah, I was not working.

I was not working.

Talking about that before.

Anyway, I'm sorry I'm so weird in not bringing up Hitler and human centipedes.

Alright, well, let's get to our next guest.

I talked about her at the top of the show.

She's a social media expert.

She's here to give us some tips.

Please welcome back to the show Francesca Bolognese.

Hello, Scott.

Hey, Brindesca.

Oh, happy to be here.

Oh my god.

So, Rachel, have you.

Just kidding.

I got your stupid email.

You wanted me to come begging me.

Oh, please, please.

Come on the bus.

Please come on the bus.

He's a big important anniversary.

We need a woman.

I'm now really regretting having two specific people up to the top of the show.

I think she's dynamite.

And I had to say it's been very typical podcast so far.

You talk about our gee.

Talk about Venus's.

When white men get together, that's what happens.

That's what happens.

When body starts laughing.

Hitler.

Yeah.

Um, what are you doing?

The tone looks wild.

Oh, okay.

Don't look.

Tone Luke.

One of the greatest tones.

Oh, yes.

From polywellness friend to.

Tom Hanks production company play.

Oh, yes.

Very good.

Thank you.

Francesca, it's so good to see you're a social media expert.

You give tips to people on how to.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

How many times do you know you are not an expert?

And I don't give a tip.

Oh, I guess one more because I thought that was what your whole thing was.

You go around giving tips to people.

No tip.

I guess I am an expert sort of because I work in social media or I did for a long time.

And now I specifically work for Bette Mjonda, the corporation.

Oh, Incorporate.

Oh, wow.

Okay, so if you remember the other time I was on, I tell you that they work a different job or Bette Mjonda.

Yeah, slightly.

She told me.

I semi-zone out every time you talk.

I have to admit.

So.

It's so nice.

Oh, my God.

He admitted.

Thank you, Tim.

Now a lot of a lot of people are just the tip.

You're the opposite, not to bring it back to the unit.

Oh, my God.

We're talking about Dixie.

Yeah, we're going to talk about Dixie tonight.

Let's talk about small, all your dickies.

Your dickies.

Oh, yes, you put my pants right down.

Your dickies, pretty small.

Oh, yeah, and it's podcast dick.

It gets smaller when you're potting.

Everyone knows that.

We're talking about penises on the show because it's the 13th anniversary.

And if you take a 13 and you tilt it 90 degrees to the left, it looks like a penis head.

I guess.

Okay.

So, yeah, so you can see how.

Everybody would like to draw a 13 and tilt it.

I guess.

I was prepared to talk about dick, so it's fine.

Oh, okay, good.

So how is Bed Bath and Beyond Corporate working out for you?

I mean, that's such a great step up for you, isn't it?

Well, so, you know, they basically have me in different things.

So last time I worked at a high school for Bed Bath and Beyond.

Oh, right.

I worked for other, in other facets for Bed Bath and Beyond, most recently though, they give me the motion.

And now I work in the store.

No!

It's the store!

In the brick and mortar!

I work in the store!

No, this is terrible!

It's the worst job I could ever imagine for myself.

What did you do to get the demotion?

Well, they say that I was a two-minned people online and at the high school and in the other job I had that I don't remember.

Right.

And they're not very nice.

So they say, okay, they demote, demote, demote, demote, and then I end up at the store!

No!

So, this is terrible.

I mean, I don't know that that's the right move on Bed Bath and Beyond's part.

You treat people so poorly they're going to put you out there in customer service.

So is that what you're doing?

You're in front of house.

I am in front of house.

I show people where the towels are.

Is that the number one thing people want to know?

They walk in and go, where are the towels?

Like, I don't want to go through your whole maze of this Bed Bath and Beyond's.

You just point me right to the towels.

I'm sopping wet.

Yes, they go, I am so wet.

I went to the beach.

Where is the towels?

I go look at the stupid fucking little signs.

I, your six, says towels.

You stupid fucking bitch.

Oh my God.

Why you know?

Fall down the cave and die alone at the bottom of the cave.

Oh man, that would be a horrible death.

What about where they shot click?

Does anyone want to know where they shot those seeds from the movie click where he gets, he goes into the Beyond section and sees Christopher walk in?

I never see them.

It must be because you're foreign because click is huge here.

Yeah, they don't show that in your training at all.

The entirety of the movie click.

No, for the training they basically have us go just standing in the stock, stock room for 15, 25 hours.

Really?

Stand up straight.

They want to know how long the shift you can work.

Oh, okay.

You guys stand in practice for American Corporation.

Right, how, where did you tap out?

What hour?

I made it a two hour.

Two hours, really?

So you can only do two hour shifts?

I only do two hour shifts and then I take a nap in one of the dog bed.

Oh, okay, right there in front of it where the customers can see you.

Exactly.

Does that count as the bed part or the beyond part?

That is a beyond part.

That's beyond.

Oh shit.

Bill, are you all right?

Well, the dog bed is beyond.

I beat beds in the name and oh shit, I'm shocked.

Well, if a dog walked in there, do you think the dog would go to the bed part looking for a dog, man?

I don't know what the stupid fucking dog come in.

I don't know where the little doggy walked to, but I would say it's not going to be much smarter than another human coming in and walking around.

So probably just aimlessly wander around for two a half hour.

Yeah, I guess that's true.

So what else is in the beyond part?

I've never realized because I go in there and I can see the towels, I can see the bedding, I can see everything that goes in the bathroom.

But then I'm just confused as to what the beyond is.

It's a lot of old different type of thing.

We have a purses.

Look.

Pencil sharpeners?

Pencil sharpener.

We have a racer too.

That's new.

Erasers are new for bed, bed, bed, and beyond this season.

Brand new.

Very exciting stuff.

And like general erasers, or is it like soda stream or Keurig is making erasers now?

Yeah, so it's a lot of different companies getting into different things.

Getting into the eraser game.

So like a big pen?

Who do they think they are, David Lynch?

Or Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vanessa Williams?

Big pen, make a brawl.

Oh, because of eraser head.

Big pen.

What did you just say?

I say the big pen.

Big pen makes bras.

Big pen makes bra.

Because you remember big pen make a pen for her.

You remember?

Oh, yes.

I love that.

And what was the difference?

It was slightly thinner, is that what it was?

Yes, it was very skinny.

And why would it?

Very weak pen.

Very big.

To imply that, you know, like, hey, I'm not going to be writing anything important with this.

I'm not writing errands, short little thing on a post-it.

A note on your husband's lunch bag.

Yeah, grocery, grocery list.

People go think women write.

Right, right.

So now they start making bras.

Yeah, they make a bra for her.

For her?

Wow.

I know.

It's crazy.

Ah!

You are freaking out, Francesca.

Well, this is the main thing, though.

Now that I work at the store, I make another lot of money.

And the manager is a fucking asshole.

Make me be nice to people for the first time in my life.

I have to be polite.

Or else what?

Or else, I don't know.

But then beyond the demote me again.

Yeah, I mean, what's even lower than the store?

I mean, like...

Bathroom.

Oh, God, that would be horrible.

Just the worst at the bathroom.

Just cleaning toilets.

No, just hang out in the bathroom.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

That would be the worst.

Make sure that everybody going properly.

Which location?

Which location are you at?

Hold on.

So people use the bathroom and then you watch them?

I just hang out in a public restroom at the corporation.

Make sure everybody battle movements going pleasantly.

How do you do this?

Is it like a check-in?

I never do this, by the way.

Oh, okay.

I have not been demoted to this, but these are here.

And when you were working there, I'm sure there were people there who...

Oh, yeah.

When I go to the bathroom, everyone's like, everything okay?

Oh, my God.

Are you sure this is a paid position or just other employees asking if your particular shits are going well?

I don't know, but I think it is a paid position.

Do you make weird noises when you...

I go, ah!

Shh!

Yeah, like...

Oh, my gosh, shit.

Well, most people do it silently.

It doesn't cause that much...

Silently.

What?

It gives you a silent.

Perfect silence.

I bet you're quiet when you have sex too.

I bet you're fucking silent.

You don't have to be when you have sex, but when you're shitting, it is a little weird to be like, ah!

Okay, well...

I don't know.

Well, which location are you at?

Can you say?

Yes, I am at the B Was Jenny.

Oh.

And she came in, she said, ah, hello, my name is Jenny.

I'm looking for air purifier.

I say, well, okay, Jenny, why not go to the aisle with the air purifier?

See, it's been very nice.

Yeah, okay.

I say, why do you...

Why do you now walk to aisle five?

Where do you find the air purifier?

She walk over, she can't find it still.

She says, excuse me, excuse me.

There is air purifier, I can't find it.

And then I say, listen a little, stupid little bitch.

Why do you now drown yourself?

You know, blender.

No, chop up your head.

Oh, no!

First drowning and then having your head chopped up.

Yes.

Wow, that's a terrible way to go.

Make a smoothie out of your head.

Oh, God.

Francesca.

Yes, sir.

Have you seen the HBO series, My Brilliant Friend?

No.

Never mind me of this one character, Lee Loshy.

So mean.

Oh my gosh, thank you.

But it's unclear whether or not she is the brilliant friend or her friend, Linu.

Is the brilliant friend of her.

You have a lot of free time to watch this HBO show.

Why is that the indi...

People watch TV shows.

Still to the, like, an entire season of one?

Are you saying because it's in another language and that's impossible for you to imagine?

No, I didn't realize it was in another language because I haven't had time to watch it.

Have you watched it old enough?

One episode.

Best show of all time.

It doesn't seem like a show that you would enjoy Francesca, I have to say.

I like to watch a little kid.

Yeah.

Because it's before they become a super stupid.

Right.

Right on the cusp.

And they're about as tall as you because aren't you for...

Yes, I'm one foot.

Oh, that's right.

Yeah, forgot.

Well, Francesca, thank you for being here.

It's great to have you.

I'm so sorry that you've been demoted.

It sounds like your life has been going horribly.

The stores are back open.

So you have a lot of time to be talking to these people that you detest so much.

Yes.

Well, I'm happy to be here to help you out with your podcast.

It's okay.

We needed a woman.

So I appreciate it.

You're welcome.

Well, can you stick around?

We have another guest we have to get to.

Yes, I guess.

Okay.

Well, he is...

I don't know.

You know, this is...

People if they can stick around.

Because a lot of times people think that they, whenever the interview is done, they just get up and they just turn around and...

Why don't you tell them beforehand?

Take care of that housekeeping all night.

Why don't you pick your own fucking podcast, TV?

Maybe I will.

Oh, God.

I'd love to see the numbers on that.

All right.

And you can stand to listen to your voice for more than five seconds.

Hey!

Hey, what?

That went a little far.

Oh, really?

Yeah, that's more personal than we ever did.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Petey.

I can't control the way I sound.

I'm sorry, Petey.

I don't mean to come at you about things you can control.

I'm sorry too.

You can control your weight though.

You're super fat.

I used to be really thin.

Remember that?

I was shredded.

Oh, yeah.

That was part of me.

But now apparently I'm this.

We have to get to our next guest.

And a lot of times on these anniversary shows, we have returning favorites, but I don't know anything about this person.

I just have a name.

He's just walked in.

He's welcome, Richie Castlebaum.

Thanks.

Thanks for having me.

I bet you know a lot about my dad because he's put so many excellent legendary characters into the CBB canon.

Oh, Rick Castlebaum, one of the legends of comedy bang bang early days.

Oh, wait.

You're Rick Castlebaum's son?

I'm his son.

Whoa.

Okay.

I guess you could call me a legacy character.

He couldn't be here today.

So I'm here in his place to talk about some of his legendary characters.

Yeah, what happened to him?

I mean, he was on so many times in the early years and then just stop booking him.

What happened?

No, he just got he got so big on his own that he just he went off, you know, right?

And then he came groveling back and you said, fuck off.

I haven't heard from you in a couple of years.

I sort of remember that.

Yeah, you got too big and then something happened to his career and he had more.

Yeah, it was one of the early Snapchat viral videos.

He filmed you from across the street being fuck off.

You think you're too good for me?

Right.

Yeah, off Rick.

I sort of remember that.

Yeah.

But hey, it's great to have you on the show.

I mean, it's great to be here with such legends of the game.

Are you a comedian as well?

No, absolutely not.

I did get a development deal from Warner Brothers through my dad, but no, I'm not a comedian.

Awesome.

Right.

What was that?

A first look deal, a blind deal, blind script?

Well, what was it?

Well, first look, blind script.

How?

It's called first look.

It's about blind people.

It's capitalizing on Kota.

It's the Kota.

Oh, it's the Kota wave right now.

Right.

Yeah.

So it feels like they were like, this sounds like Oscar bait.

You're on.

Right.

You're on.

So what is it like Kota is all about a girl who sings in her family who is hearing impaired can't hear her.

What is this for blind people?

It's the exact same thing but for blind people.

Oh, singing too?

No, no, no.

It's someone watching a concert and they're there with their blind parents and they're just narrating what's going on.

Oh, but I mean, at a concert, people are just kind of staying there playing their instruments.

It doesn't seem like it says big of a tragedy or at least ironic as Kota.

You've never been blind.

We got you.

Is it?

So I can close my eyes though and it's practically the same thing.

No, it's not the same thing because then you have visions that you've already seen before.

I didn't come here to talk about my development deal.

I came here to talk about my dad.

It is awesome character.

The amount of times that sentence has been said on Comedy Bang Bang.

I mean, Scott constantly trying to talk to business but we're trying to talk family out there.

Yeah, exactly.

I'm sorry.

I want to talk about my dad's classic characters like Mr. Fiddle Diddle D doodle D used to go.

Don't make some just a nice boy.

How do you like your coffee?

Oh, yeah.

I remember that guy.

Only one of the biggest characters from early.

Well, only one episode.

But yeah.

Yeah.

That was his thing.

I remember the episode and then people talking about it.

Right.

What else did he do?

I did Pearl S wisdom in your future.

I'm seeing a bunch of washes.

Wow.

That was such a good impression.

I remember that episode.

The early years.

Yeah.

We're really different.

Yeah.

We're worthy.

I don't know.

They were exactly the same.

Then you'd be like, I hate your guts.

Why did you come on this show?

Right.

Yeah.

Exactly.

What else?

I mean, those were two big characters.

You should not be wanting to hear more.

Sure.

Why not?

Oh, okay.

He did Sufjan Stevens.

What fucking stand you from?

He's from New York.

I don't know.

Who knows?

What he claims to be from every state.

This was, you know, this was like the 80s when every standup was getting a sitcom.

Yes.

And this was the early comedy bang bang where everyone wanted a catch phrase, right?

And your dad would come on and try out his catch phrase.

A lot of people like catch phrases on the show are in the early years and the first couple, especially.

I had a big strategy.

He was like, I come on, I get my catch phrase on there and then I become a legend.

Right.

Yeah.

And he did have these catch phrases that you said, but, and he is a legend.

Although I, to be honest, I don't really remember him.

I've been sort of saying like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I don't really remember him being on.

That's ice cold.

I mean, it was 13 years ago.

Do you remember what you had for breakfast, you know, in 2009?

Yeah.

What I have the same breakfast every day.

Greek yogurt with berries and cashews.

So yeah, I do know what I had for breakfast 13 years ago.

Okay.

I stand correct.

Wow.

An early adopter of the Greek yogurt trend.

Or were you in Europe or Greece?

Yeah.

13 years ago, I was living in Greece.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

Doing what?

Uh, just cashing in my dad's checks.

Yeah.

Why?

Okay.

And he's rich, I guess.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

See, this is the thing.

You're pretending you don't know his whole career.

Yeah.

It's got your jealous.

I mean, I, I, yeah.

I mean, the green eyed monster.

What makes us all does it not?

Mostly you.

Shut the fuck up.

You shut the fuck up.

This is my fucking show.

That's why.

Fuck you.

You fuck you.

Fuck you.

No, fuck you.

Fuck you.

No, fuck you.

Fuck you.

No, fuck you.

Oh, gosh.

This is classic stuff.

Do you have anyone can get fucked?

Do you have anymore?

Sure.

And you catch phrase born before my eyes.

Everybody can get fucked.

You have anymore characters you want to talk about or you.

My dad's characters.

Yeah.

I mean, you keep pulling up your phone like you have a long, long list of them, but it could just be three characters long.

No, no, no, no.

You're closing it on the end.

You used to do.

That took a peek.

I scrolled to the bottom.

Danny fuck sticks.

I can't be under arrest.

I was just fucking these two sticks.

Okay.

But those were his catch phrases.

You know, the characters were as rich and deep as anything in modern American literature.

Right.

And why don't you do characters?

I mean, you've been doing these voices, good impressions from what I understand.

Oh, no, I can only do the catch phrases.

I can't sustain any kind of character voice for more than I don't know.

One or two sentences.

Right.

And you've always talked like this?

Yeah, this is how I sound.

Right out of the womb, I was like, thanks, doc.

There's a little cold in here.

Send me back into the womb.

You know?

I'm not willing to hear this.

I am an inspirer.

I am a man who brings the greatness out of men.

You've got a great character in you, Mr. Castlebottom.

Thank you, Bill.

We've got to rip it out.

Let's rip it out of there.

You want to rip it out of you?

Like the uterine lining.

Let's see a check.

Stop talking about uterus.

Every single one of you bringing up a vagina at some point already.

No dicks.

No vagina is no hitlers.

It's cancel culture all over the place.

Are you scared of cancel culture being a thing?

I'm not being a thing.

I'm scared of me being canceled personally.

Because of your personality.

Yes.

But I'm a whole, I think everybody gets canceled.

Everybody's so stupid.

Right.

I mean, you're one of those people who would be canceled not because you said anything offensive necessarily, but just because of your whole thing.

Yeah.

It'd be like rumors over the course of many years that I am a terrible person.

Right.

And then it finally catch up with...

The damn just breaks.

Like Ellen, Jimmy Fallon.

Or other...

Allen's.

Allen.

Two of the great Allen's from Allen to Jimmy Fallon.

Oh!

From a person's project to...

Anon.

One of the great Anons from Allen on to QAnon.

Yes.

So, some of the scariest Anons out there are the QAnons, aren't they?

So, ending a whole letter of the alphabet for the rest of us.

Let's get this character out of you, Richie, as I looked down at the page.

Let's get this character out of you.

I don't know.

Throw out a name.

Any name.

Harry.

Harry!

Not bad, okay.

Well, a nice layup to start it off.

Yeah, okay.

Harry, and what does he do for a living?

Let's say he's a carpenter.

Carpenter.

His last name's drawers.

Harry drawers.

This is good because a carpenter would probably make some drawers in some sort of a furniture thing.

And I bet that the man when you open the drawers a chest, there's a bunch of hair inside though.

Oh, that's true.

Wow.

See, I just pull and suffer my subconscious because I'm such a huge fan.

Yeah, are you working her side of the street a little too much though?

Like are you getting, are you feeling like he's...

You're saying we're both hookers?

What do you say?

What do you apply?

No, I just mean like, is that too close to what you do?

It's a little close, but at this point, whatever you need, buddy, are you got your back?

Okay, great.

Oh, I don't think a carpenter has anything to do.

Just kidding.

I know.

I look.

This seems the...

No, it's the Harry part, I think, is what she's...

I'm so intimidated.

Oh, the Harry part.

I think about having your back.

I know that you're back in all of you.

That's what I thought.

Let's do this.

Okay, so please welcome to the show Harry Drawers.

Oh.

Oh, no.

Thanks for having me.

Oh, I don't know.

I just got here from my wood shop.

Why are you talking like that, Harry?

It's always...

That's your dance.

That's Changie.

Oh, that's true.

Oh, yeah, I knew it wasn't me.

Well, it wasn't him.

If I heard you in a bit better me on the bathroom, I would be like, oh my god, we need to call the ambulance.

Yeah, why do you talk like that, Harry?

Um, I'm...

Cause I'm just a nice guy.

Oh.

Bill, I don't know.

I love this guy.

This guy's got wings.

He's got a voice.

He's got a double entendre.

Throw it down, big man, one time.

Yeah, I don't know.

I want Richie back.

Yeah, I got a bail on the guy.

It's just not my thing.

I got two sentences in and I got self-conscious.

Yeah, yeah.

Maybe, yeah.

You're not ready for it.

No, that's okay.

I want like the not ready for prime time players.

Hey, great.

Those are some of the most famous people in the country right now.

Well, Richie, I thank you for being here.

Now, I'm going to ask you this.

Can you stick around?

Absolutely not.

Someone else coming in?

Or are you just leaving?

No, I got a bail.

I absolutely got a bail.

Okay.

I get it.

I understand.

But we also, we need to take a break.

We need to do our form of bailing, which is to take a break.

But before we do that, we're going to be hearing a song from the band stars.

Stars is here, the new album from Capleton Hill.

All right, so now let's go to them.

Stars, are you ready?

We are.

We are going to play you.

Oh, I'm ready.

It's called Build a Fire.

Now, is this about the television show survivor, about the fire challenges?

It actually sort of is.

Okay, great.

It's about paranoia and capitalist threat and fear of death.

So, yes, it is about the television show survivor.

You're describing all of my favorite songs right now.

You may want to.

So, wonderful.

All right, well, let's hear it.

This is stars.

Hit it, guys.

Ladies and gentlemen, stars.

You're left alone with your thoughts on it.

When someone calls you, tell them that you're okay.

Outside the lawn, those shadows crawl.

You put away the past and you try to go to sleep.

Time to build a fire.

Time to light it up.

Time to let it burn brighter than it's time to stop.

And then it's time to start.

I never knew you could be that bad.

Time to start.

I never knew you could be that bad.

I never knew you would hurt me.

I never knew you could be that bad.

I never knew you would hurt me.

I need the empty city again.

Waiting for your past going running from your friends.

Outside they're putting down the past.

They dream it in their sleep if they think it's gonna last.

The night goes 90 miles from my home.

Telling fire and dawn is a holding like a flower.

They live our life of quiet despair.

They turn to pull you in.

They never find you there.

I never knew you could be that bad.

I never knew you would hurt me.

I never knew you could be that bad.

I never knew you would hurt me.

I never knew you could be that bad.

I never knew you could hurt me.

I never knew you could be that bad.

I never knew you would hurt me.

I never knew you could be that bad.

Someone gets knocked down, my friend.

Man, what happened?

Think it up again.

Okay.

And Richie Castlebaum took off.

So no big loss there.

And of course we have stars here all the way from Montreal.

It's a pleasure and an honor.

Happy anniversary.

And now we have a returning favorite here.

He is a clergy person in the ministry trying to get out there and save people.

And also an enthusiast of a certain type of food.

Please welcome back to the show, Pasta Pasta.

Pasta Pasta.

Sorry.

I can never know how.

Pasta Scott.

Never quite remember how to pronounce it.

And you say it like my identity is separate.

Also an enthusiast of pasta.

But I'm an enthusiast because I'm a pasta.

And I'm an enthusiast of pasta.

I'm an enthusiast of pasta.

And I'm an enthusiast of pasta.

You know you're not supposed to be in here messing around.

That's exactly what I'm saying.

That's the only thing that stops a grave robber is judgment from the corpse.

Yeah, absolutely.

Absolutely.

But that's my idea.

I do like the idea of putting my body in pasta.

Would you eat my ass in a ravioli?

That question is for you, Scott.

I made direct eye contact.

I don't think so.

Keep my mind out dying.

You are dying, but by the time you die you'll be dead and it won't matter what I do.

It will because I'm going to be watching down from here.

You think you'll be a ghost?

Hell ghost?

I'll be a host.

I'm going to be fucking two.

Because I couldn't fail.

Well, because I couldn't fuck with Ali.

Oh, yeah.

Well, once you get to hell, you can do all this.

I could fuck.

I never thought about this.

I'm going to come back up.

Can the people from hell watch us too?

Yeah, they watch.

Like the people from Evan do?

Yeah, they watch.

Lucifer told me.

He's seen Ali off again.

Really?

What do you think?

He says you got some work to do.

He also, I actually got a text from him.

Oh, yeah.

He says Scott has some work to do.

I think he thinks his partner is happy.

She's been talking to me direct.

Cool.

I've been talking to Cice.

He prefers.

Oh, he prefers Lou?

Yeah, Lou, Lou.

Louis Cipher.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah, Louis C.

Oh, no.

Louis C.

What the?

I'm like, please don't say it.

Please don't say it.

You enjoyed his SNL host.

SNL set.

Who are your favorite hosts?

You're trying to get me canceled.

I'll make it right before I pass it.

I guess it doesn't matter.

Yeah.

If I'm dying.

Say whatever you want to say.

Let's cancel you.

Favorite hosts.

Now your big thing is pasta, but you're a pastor.

So remember that when you're thinking.

Okay.

Right.

Who would you say Bill?

Right.

Oh, it's got to be Charles.

Why?

Oh, it's got to be Charles Barkley.

Why?

Oh, because did you see him elbowing Barney and that's.

Oh, elbow, Megaroni.

Oh, I'm going for a movie.

Big, big, big.

Okay.

So that makes sense.

My favorite hosts.

I mean, all my favorite hosts are, are predators and, and people know one's rooting for.

What if they got a predator from the movie predator to host?

That would be incredible.

It wouldn't be much unlike the way the show works now.

Yeah.

You know, alien would text all his friends and be like, they fucking got predators.

They got predators.

But then they'd get alien next season.

We both top line that movie.

Yeah.

They'd get alien the following season.

Yeah.

I don't really watch SNL.

Yeah.

I'm really honest with you.

Yeah, really.

Not my kind of, not my kind of progress.

Because it comes on right before church.

Literally a half hour before church starts.

Half hour before church starts.

And so I'm usually prepared for my sermons and, and such.

I don't mean to bring the mood down, but I am going to be passing away in maybe 20 minutes.

Yeah, it's coming up.

Well, no, I think he'll a little more than that.

More than 20 minutes.

I know often to make y'all pasta, but I actually think that's rude that y'all would have.

Yeah, we don't want you to leave.

We don't want you to be, use your final moments here on my...

In a bait and a swatch.

Yeah.

We're really getting hungry.

Well, if you're hungry, get your ass in the kitchen.

Hey, I thought we were in the same zone.

We all on the same side of the house.

We hate this guy.

We do hate.

He sucks.

We do hate him.

You don't remember how annoying he is, though?

I don't think he's annoying.

I think he's asshole.

Thank you.

So he's intentionally annoying.

Yeah, and that's better.

That's better.

Okay, I guess so.

It represents a sort of an awareness.

Oh, okay.

Wait a minute.

But that's how you are, Scott.

Huh?

Maybe we're not so different after all.

B.C.B.?

You're willfully up to.

Should we be B.F.F.?s?

I love this.

B.F.S. is okay.

I love this.

Just best friends.

Boyfriend.

Not forever.

Boyfriend.

Put a ring on it.

You're not going to get there.

It's like, come on.

He don't value you.

You're going to be boyfriend forever.

Common law.

Yeah, Richie, what do you got?

Oh, I...

Justin Jeneryl.

Because Richie seems to have tapped out.

I'm dying.

And Richie is so disconnected from what's happening.

I'm not dying.

Are you checking your stocks or your...

I'm just in awe of all the bitcoins.

I'm in awe of tracking all the things that could become catch-free.

I'm trying to be respectful of the last few moments on Earth that passed the epidemic.

The dying.

Do you have anyone you want us to contact?

Yeah.

Pastor Pasta.

Mr. Burilla.

Who's Mr. Burilla?

Creator Burilla Pasta.

I've never got to thank him.

What is the shape of Burilla Pasta?

I'm having a hard time picturing.

It varies.

It's a brand.

They got all kinds.

They got spaghetti, rigatoni, spaghetti.

And you...

That's your favorite...

Frigatoni.

Right.

Spaghetti.

We just said this several times.

Frigatoni.

Seems like you know about three bosses today.

You've been guining.

The last time you had a huge list of about 30 that you were like...

What is that about?

Well, hold on now, because you underestimated me.

I don't think it's a riser, honey.

No.

I want to just say no.

I don't like rice.

It is the enemy of a pasta.

That's right.

Well, they're both carbs.

Well, all carbs are not created equal, Scott.

Okay.

Sorry.

Fettuccini.

You got your list of...

Okay.

Capilini.

Mm-hmm.

Spaghettiini.

Yeah.

Amen.

Spaghettiini.

Buchiettelli.

One thing I learned at Italy is that you just added teeny at the end.

It's a new pasta.

Okay.

Yeah.

Damn.

You ever had a martini bullet age?

Yeah.

The deletion.

Hold on.

Hello, Mr. Birla.

Oh, my God.

Let's check your sodium bubbles.

Oh, no.

No.

With my thermometer.

Oh, no, he's walking immediately out.

Oh, my God.

I'm sorry.

I got it.

That hits you.

Yeah.

That was...

The most popular recipe products contained in rice and pasta mixture.

Oh.

What'd I tell you?

The pasta is either Rosea Marina, Rice Street pasta or cut vermicelli.

It's happening.

Oh, no.

Why you do it?

Why to him?

It's already...

Why don't you respect me?

What about who's cause you like a...

Oh, I'm...

Oh, wait a minute.

Wait a minute.

No, stay with us.

Don't go into the red light.

Oh, mouth and teeth.

I don't think he's dying.

You're a queen.

You're a fine.

She's like...

What about a quinoa?

Oh, no, you're killing him.

I'm sorry.

I wanted to make sure I know my pasta.

I work it anyway.

Oh, my God.

Are you sure you're dying and you don't just have to fart?

Oh, wait.

Oh, no.

I mean...

You are so...

You are so right.

That's a fun thing.

Maybe do something about farts.

Farting is good comedy.

It could be anything.

Yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Fart Fimpsen or something like that.

Yeah!

Oh, that would be good.

That thing.

Don't have a...

My farts, man.

Yeah.

Something like that.

Yeah, but I think you need to work on it and come back with it.

Oh, yeah, absolutely.

You can't just launch into it now.

No, no, you're right.

You're right.

I'll work shopping.

I'll work shopping in my brain.

I'll tune out for a little while.

Okay, that sounds good to me.

You've got Fart Simpson coming up around the corner here.

Fart Fimpsen, yes.

I think it's crazy that I'm dying.

You're not dying.

You're just...

Hold on.

I actually think it's insane that I'm dying and y'all just go sit up here and talk about fictional characters.

Yeah.

Maybe.

Nobody else thinks it's crazy.

I'm the only one that thinks it's crazy.

I don't know that you're dying.

What do you mean that I have to...

You just think I have to fall?

Yeah, I think that...

You think my doctor told me you have to fall in 45 minutes.

And I misunderstood it as you died.

You think I'm stupid?

It could be, yeah.

Faster, what can we do for you to make your final moments comfortable?

How can we ease your suffering?

Well, you want me to rub your tummy?

I would love for you to rub my tummy and I would love for Scott to rub my feet.

You want to see a bubble that looks like a penis?

I do.

I think we all do.

Let me fire up my hot plate here.

Okay.

Alright.

How long is it going to take for this bubble to be?

45 minutes.

Oh, she doesn't even have...

He doesn't even have 40 minutes.

That's wrong with you.

Sorry.

So rude.

I'm sorry.

I know I got some big hips on me, but that is no reason.

You are thick.

I'm very thick.

Well, you eat pasta every day.

I'd love to watch you walk away.

But I'm not going to.

I'm going to die.

I'm going to die right here.

You die face down.

Would that be okay?

Pass up.

That's the way that I like to see you die.

I just die.

Okay.

Great.

I could do that for you.

Yeah.

I'm sure I will.

Guys, this has been a pleasure.

I'm going to excuse myself.

No, stay here for a little bit.

I'm going to recuse myself from this bubble.

Wait, I have one more question.

I'm going to say, I'm going to do that.

I'm going to do that.

That is not the sad.

I won't come back to the podcast in ghost form.

Do you promise to be a ghost next time?

I'll be a host.

Okay.

Take the G off.

We all make a promise.

I have a ghost.

Well, a hell ghost who is also a hoe.

We all make a promise to be ghost after this.

That would be great.

Wait, are you saying we should do a suicide pact at the end of this show?

What did you hear?

Well, we'll pass a pass.

It's great to have you on the show.

Pass a pass.

I even though you've pronounced it.

What?

Because I'm allowed to confuse people.

But I'm the one who should be serving the show.

Because you're a host.

You're a host.

I'm not a ghost.

I'm not a host.

Not a ghost.

Oh.

That's right.

You're probably going to hell, though.

You think so?

I'm going to hell, really.

For sure.

Check in with Lucifer if you could.

Okay.

Well, he doesn't have good days to say about you.

Really?

What's he saying?

Because Coolup talking to him.

I mean, he's talked about how the way that...

Pleasure your wife.

Yeah.

He has.

But she has.

Or don't.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah.

Well, okay.

You're shaking right now.

I am...

I am shook right now.

You are actually shook by this edition.

You're shaking.

Damn.

Okay.

Well, I'm going to go pathway in the bathroom.

He's about to...

All right.

Well, come in and check on me, please.

Yeah, okay.

We'll do a pasta pasta, everyone.

Glad to see you.

Rest in peace.

Rest in pasta.

I got it out first.

I did it first.

Why you know?

No.

Well, we have to take a break.

When we return, we'll have more.

No, but...

No, this is my show.

You get your own podcast.

You see if I don't.

Oh, man.

I would love to see big chunky bubbles have...

Maybe a CBB presents episode with big chunky bubbles.

What does who?

Yeah, exactly.

All right.

We are going to go to that break, but stars.

Do you guys want to do your second song?

You know it.

Yeah, we're going to play Cables in Hell.

Hey!

You!

Oh!

I'm still a gardener.

Hey!

Dude!

Hey!

What are you doing?

Hey, I'm doing a show here.

Scott, I'm your gardener.

I'm Gary the gardener, baby.

I had to come blow some leaves, baby.

Oh, yeah?

You're the guy who's been blowing all the leaves the last six months and five months of the show when I've been taping them in my back yard.

By the way, Scott, where the hell are we right now?

What is this place?

This is a studio.

This is the year-old studio.

Did you just follow me here?

Scott, I'm your gardener.

So I follow, I put a tracker on your shoes.

What?

When I follow you, what is Apple?

Apple, what is it?

Apple tabs are you and wherever you are, I'm blowing leaves, Scott!

Oh my God, I hate that sound.

What do you mean, it's that sound?

Scott, I'm kind of the fifth, like the fifth character of the podcast.

You're like God.

What New York is to the turtle?

I'm the star of the backyard era of comedy, baby.

You've been ruining the show for the last five months.

You're the show.

You mean that dulcid tone that's just like a high-pitched whistle?

Are you the guy who's also been backing a truck up to...

Yeah!

And I've been hammering stuff.

I do a lot of yard-wise- Triple threat.

Scott, what?

First of all, I'm pretty pissed this is the first time I've been on the podcast, Scott.

Yeah, well, I haven't wanted you on the show.

It's an interruption.

Scott, I have a lot of interesting things about me that I feel like you haven't just the people on the podcast.

It is an open-door policy.

It's open to anyone who wants to talk, so obviously we have Richie here.

Yeah, I don't know.

Who the hell is this guy?

Oh, yeah, I'm about to leave.

Now, let me ask you, Scott, do you want me to keep blowing leaves in here?

No!

Okay, do you want to talk about the interesting things about you?

Yeah, of course!

All right.

I'm fucking a Vitus Flytrap.

What?

I am fucking a Vitus Flytrap.

Is that not interesting, Scott?

Wow!

He's achieved the great dream of mankind.

Please tell us more about making love to a Vitus Flytrap.

Everyone's seen one and wants to do it.

I mean, yeah, it's that flower that latches on to something.

Yeah!

Anything passes by.

And when you put a penis in there, it will latch on to Scott.

Francesca, what do you think about, are we finally talking about penises again?

Well, yes, we're talking about penises, I'm sure.

I feel like everybody's trying to leave right now.

Yes, I really have an important thought.

You have an important...

I mean, I'm not going to be on the...

Is this the way you have to go and Richie has to go?

I also have to go.

What?

Well, mostly just because I don't like you.

No, stick around.

I can't.

I gotta go.

Does he don't like me?

I mean, I get to go because I don't like to go.

Oh, I see.

Okay.

I love you, Scott.

He just started.

We did my right.

I know, I thought there was going to be a break.

So did I.

Hey, you're like a Ross.

We hit it off, so I'm going to give her a ride.

I thought we were going to have a break.

We're going to have an interesting thing about you.

He's just going to plow through it, I guess.

It's a barrel on a watch.

I only eat human flesh, Scott.

What?

Really?

Yeah, I'm an opposite of a vegetarian.

So for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?

Yeah, I skip lunch.

Oh, okay.

So for breakfast and dinner, human flesh.

Actually, I have a sensible shake for lunch.

Okay.

Oh, human flesh.

Oh, human flesh, legend.

It's freeze-dried flesh.

Where do you get the flesh?

I gotta ask.

Scott, you do not want to know.

Come on.

I really do want to know.

Okay, I get it from a monthly flesh subscription box.

Flesh-cription.

It's called flesh box.

Oh, wait.

Okay, I subscribed to that for a bit, and yeah, it was different than what I thought it was going to be.

Yeah, you thought it was going to be a flesh light in there.

You gotta find a Venus fly-cha.

Every month, a new flash.

Are you sure it's not called Hello, Flesh?

Damn, that's better.

You know, Scott, I'm also a gardener to the start.

Really?

That's right.

What's the start?

Oh, my God.

I'm a gardener to the start.

It's such a start as, you know, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby.

Oh, they, oh, J Simpson, and you.

Oh, jeez.

You guys all in next door to each other?

Yeah, I'm just like, fuck you.

It's easy to just get them all in at the same day.

House is pretty cheap.

I think the neighborhood, the market value.

Yeah.

Everywhere.

You want to ask me any questions about Kevin Spacey?

Yeah, I mean, what's he doing on, what does he do on this video?

He's making a video, Scott.

I wish I didn't like them so much.

What's he doing the other 364 days of your video?

He's rehearsing the video.

Oh, yeah, they're so good.

He's writing, rewriting, getting the writers room, breaking off a B room, rehearsing, doing pre-production, and then on Christmas day, he comes in and he says, well, hello there.

Or whatever the fuck he says.

Spacey Claus.

Yeah.

He's pretty cool.

He is really.

He's an guy.

No.

He treats me pretty poorly.

Really?

Is that cool?

Yeah, what it is.

Cool.

He makes me cut all his bushes into dicks.

And then sits on him.

And then he comes in and he slaps him around and sits on him.

And he says, thank God y'all can't respond.

He says, oh, allegedly.

Allegedly this happened.

Oh, no, this happened to me.

I don't know that I believe you.

I can't believe I have all these stories, Scott.

Tell me, Scott, Dan, tell me any kind of story you want.

I mean, these guys are, okay, I'm looking at their watching.

I got a little script I've been working on.

Oh, that's right.

So you're a screenwriter as well.

I am a screenwriter as well.

What do you got?

The someone thing.

It's a little something called the Costic Gardeners.

Oh, okay.

I'm the constant gardener.

Yeah, but this is the Costic Gardener.

Wait, what did you say?

I thought you said Costic.

No, I said the Costic.

You said constant.

Oh, yeah.

There is a thing called that?

Yeah.

What's it about?

It's about a bridge, bridge, double, double, double, double, double.

Is it about water rights in Africa or something like that?

Yeah, I think so.

All right, I'm across.

Yeah, you got to rewrite.

I got to write that one out.

You know I piss a shit and all your plants.

I could tell.

You're my mother.

Be you stinky.

Oh, well, I've been pulling a Weinstein in most of them.

Now, what the hell does that mean?

Walking out in the robe and just kind of letting it swing open?

Yeah, you got to read up on this.

You're simply must.

I do not know how to read.

To be in polite society these days, you have to read up on that story.

Oh, I can't be doing that.

I'm in the gardens doing all the gardening, Scott.

How you liking your garden so far?

I mean, you know, other than the shapes that you've been cutting all the plants in.

My butt.

Yeah, it was that what it was.

It's a butt and then there's two hands sort of spreading them open.

Yeah, turn around and yeah.

Oh, yeah, that's it.

I'm doing like the Ace Ventura thing where he talks about his butt.

Yeah, it's a little straight.

Everyone thinks that Jim Carrey lives where I live, first of all.

And then they ring the doorbell expecting me to like come out in the mask or whatever and say smoking.

Did you know that Sonic 2 is going to be his last movie?

Yeah, I heard something about that.

No!

Not that good.

Yeah!

Why does everybody scream this?

I thought he was back in action, you know, bringing out the old.

Like Looney Jones?

Yes, Looney 2 is back in action.

What a big great.

Like Space Jam, a new legacy.

Space Jam, a new legacy to.

Here we go.

He's doing it.

He's doing it to the family guy on Cartoon Network in the early 2000s.

Wow, he pulled it off.

He's under finished.

He did it.

That's son of a.

I want to talk about the slap Scott.

Oh, okay, sure.

What do you got?

What is that crazy when Will Smith slapped him?

That's all you wanted to say about it?

I just feel like...

I thought you would come in with a take about it.

I remember you emailed every podcaster trying to get on a podcast the week after a slap.

I was shut down.

But that's all you had to say?

Yeah!

Is it was crazy?

Well, I personally am glad to hear someone else thought that was unusual.

Was it crazy?

I couldn't believe it.

I feel like in memorial to that slap, I will be cutting a bush in the shape of Chris Rock's surprised face.

I was like, what is that?
