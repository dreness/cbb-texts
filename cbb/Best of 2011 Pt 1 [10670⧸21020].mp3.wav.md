two zero one one their numbers okay we got that straight but uh... what do they mean when you put them all together two thousand eleven that's what they mean it's it's a year uh... and uh... this is the best of the year and uh... we're gonna count them down your episodes that you selected from ten to five this is the first of two comedy bang bang best of episodes all of that and more on today's to the eleven we're out of the house twenty eleven or two thousand eleven your preference really we're all yankovic yeah what about dog what about dog happy new year just kidding uh... it's not the new year yet it is uh... still two thousand eleven now welcome to comedy bang bang uh... this is a very special best of episode the first of two best of episodes the first time we've done this before but we've uh...

split it into two the clips are just too good uh... and when they're too good you split in into two episodes and uh... so this is the first of two and many perhaps maybe we'll do several episodes who knows but no just two uh...

we're uh... we're here it's a lovely los angeles morning and if you've never heard the show before let me explain who i am uh... my name of course is assessment and uh... welcome to the show i am your host and uh... maybe you're listening to this because a friend said hey here's a good way to get into the show listen to the best of clips well you're smart because these are indeed the best of clips they are voted on by you you the listeners have told me what to play on the show today and so i'm very excited to be count them down and uh... another person when you speak of it of excitement this name comes to mind instantly and his name is polyftop can all i was scared it wasn't going to be me uh...

no no no it's of course you let me walk you through the journey i went on first i thought when you when you started that ramp up i was like oh this is me and how exciting and then i thought maybe we're getting to a clip well i i yeah i thought that's pretty self-absorbed to think that scott is automatically talking about me any number of things could be happening at this juncture in the show then when you said my name i was so relieved and flattered and yet also you and yeah that's right well of course and then thinking that i felt bad and that's why i'm explaining everything to you i'm unburdening myself and how do you feel now that you have unburdened yourself i feel good ok good it feels good to get it off your chest i have several problems with the scenario where people are listening to this for the first time okay please do first of all please i don't know if you do me if a friend please i do that's what's important please do have these problems please do have these problems in front of me uh if if if someone's listening to this for the first time on the advice of a friend who said listen to the best of episode i don't think the person listening is smart i think the friend is smart i think i think the person listening is smart to maybe have smart friends and to choose their friends uh wisely uh you can pick your friends that's true you can pick your nose you're welcome to wisely but you can't pick your nose wisely you can pick your friends wisely but it's unwise to pick your friend's nose because that wasn't a friendship it might yeah unless you're in Germany where people like put out ads in the paper like come pick my nose ask before you pick your friend's nose like one of bill marque rules new rules your old bell bill mar well buddy what was your what was by the way paul if thompkins is a comedian it used to be on new rules with bill mar if you're listening to this for the first time and uh when the advice of a smart friend what was the name in the show new rules what was the name of your was it thompkins corner thompkins square what was it what was it on the name of your segment i honestly don't recall if it had a name i don't think that it did what did the thompkins square wouldn't have been that that's pretty good would they have they cut to you and you explained what was happening in the the news yes in the middle of the show about current events they would cut to me and then i would talk about some other current events but in a more overtly comedic fashion oh so you're saying that bill mar is not overtly comedic well i'm saying he likes to get serious sometimes he likes to make a serious point and my stuff was all just kidding around but that's not to say that you don't have serious points yourself but you were playing a serious point you were playing the role of the clown on that show the court jester if you will in the court of bill mar well we will all be judged in god's court uh but another problem that's a scenario where somebody's listening for the first time and i can't remember what it was oh no you said if you listen to your first time if you're listening for the first time then and your friend has pointed this out to you that uh uh you're smart you're smart and this is a way to get into the show perhaps for you and this may be your first episode ever that's about all i said as i recall that's a real thing but that was wrong so if you're just listening to this for the first time you're smart white white power oh i think i heard what it was off i think i heard that yeah off mic you yelled white power i did yeah i think people are gonna have a problem well you know i mean what made you do that well i just i'm contractually obligated to do it before the end of the year and uh really yeah you're really just one time you got to get it in just one time yeah wow and i got it in at the just under the wire that was a close one had you forgotten the rest of the year or were you sort of no it was it was on the back of my in the back of my mind on the back of my mind on the back burner in the back of your mind yeah exactly where you keep a stove a mental stove i and that is my little secret i've not been able to do a show this year listen back to all of them you can hear it in my voice that i'm like oh and i'm gonna get white power in we're gonna this is this is almost like new rules of of Bill Maher right now. We're through the looking glass and down the rabbit hole. Oh, no, the two things Alice loved to do. That's right. We also drank a potion.

and that .....

oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah that's not bad I like that we both have perfect pitch we recall exactly how those jingles go um... if this is your first time listening by the way I apologize for all that you must be wondering what is this show well let me explain a little bit uh... what the show is um... I have several of my funny friends like polyft thompkins on one of them and uh... we talk for a while and then every once in a while something uh... strange will happen some uh... nuts will walk in the room and will boy oh boy and uh...

there are a bunch of characters if I may uh... I think I see what you're saying they're uh... they're odd they're odd balls yeah they're uh... goofy goof balls they're nuts nut balls they're dicks no paul won't say it I can't bring myself paul won't say it paul won't say dick balls then dick balls dick hey hey it's end of the year I'm contracted to say dick balls once before the end of the year do um... so yeah every once in a while I'll be talking to someone and this actually sets up our first clip here if we could uh... have the music for number ten number ten this sets up our first clip uh... almost precisely sometimes I'll be talking to one of my funny friends and in this instance this is from our number ten clip uh... basically let me tell you everyone voted on their ten favorite shows of the year and the ten that got the most votes were that was the other problem I had ooh is that you were still addressing the person who was listening for the first time and you were saying you voted on these clips now I find it highly unlikely that someone listening for the first time went to the ear wolf message boards and and and sought out paul come on now the episode to then voted on individual clips you're getting your agita ooh ah gee dahh it gives me I'm sorry please continue with your so newcomers this is your tenth thing that you voted on uh...

I enjoyed it just as much the second time here I'm gonna say I did the first time not anymore though but just the same exactly which was a great deal I did enjoy it a great deal I'm not it's not a loophole thing where it's like I didn't enjoy it at all I'm really sorry I asked you this well I accept your apology okay well I wasn't apologizing to you well you said you're sorry alright fair enough words these words that was a case where a person came in in the middle of the show but our number nine clip is you have an open door policy here I should explain that to the new listener we have an open door policy we've never shut this door that's part of the problem it's open right now it's actually it's a little chilly yeah I know it's a December it opens out onto the street it really does so but this that's a case where someone dropped by in the middle but in the case of our number nine clip by the way let's hear that music number nine number nine by Menon in the case of our number nine clip this is where a person was here at the very beginning of the show and this is from episode 92 and this is one of the two episodes we did this year where my 15 year old intern came by to do the show yeah Marissa Wampler Wamp up the jams.com I think is what it was I believe so she's irascible she basically I don't know how she even got this job well she's precocious and she knows just what it takes to make a problish that's from Betty Davis eyes like your cards a probeless terrible rhyme I was thinking today I was listening to Christmas in Hollis for 20 years I thought it was it's Christmas time in Hollis Queens Moz cooking chicken and calling it greens and I didn't I couldn't figure out why she would do that because you had never heard of collard green yeah I well you know I mean I just when did you make the discovery of collard greens I think I still thought that in the song for maybe a good five years after I knew what collard greens were too oh Scott I mean that's irresponsible it really when you have to be responsible when you listen to your Christmas music you are responsible when you listen to your Christmas music so don't shirk your responsibilities no never do always look up the lyrics if any song you're listening to and read along that's right with the singer just that's your responsibility as a listener it really is yeah I tell you what you don't have to sing along just know what the words are that's true come on guys and sing along and sing along you do have to do that yes you do but what are we talking about oh wamp up the jams okay so oh bad at her all over again she I don't know how she got the job but she's my intern and so everyone and she's just supposed to get coffee or something but she ends up co-hosting the show with me yeah she throws in her two cents quite often two hundredths of a dollar yeah so Andy Richter was my guest on this show and Marissa is there and he was a pretty good sport about everything he really was he he loves to share the spotlight and you'll hear him do this on our number nine clip this is from episode 92 bro number nine my guest for the entire hour is Andy Richter and my co-host for most of the entire program is Marissa Wampler my 15 year old intern is here very nice to see you we were we were remarking during the break that uh it's kind of hard to kind of step around and not say the things that we normally say on this show we're sort of holding back well I do listen to your show really? yeah well every so often I've listened to like maybe four of them incidentally right I'm sure you didn't listen to the one you were on four times yes I did okay I was so funny on the show also did some remixes like my best bits remix it with like a beat or something like that yeah with beats because I have garage bands so I did beats and stuff but yeah I don't don't hold back because I know I know that stuff I watch True Blood and I have um show time too so well True Blood I mean it's basically just their vampires and they they have sex on it but there's nothing weird going on like I don't know do you think drinking other people's blood is weird that's pretty dark and weird well it all depends on the context you know if you're like at a vampire club what are you gonna do have a dying coat when in a row?

yeah you want to fit in with the other vampires right have you seen that new show skins that controversial show skins? I haven't seen it yet but I I can't wait to see it right it seems bonerific yeah yeah have you ever seen a boner by the way do you know what a boner is? yes I know what a boner is I have not had a boyfriend yet um that's not the question that well have you seen a boner? no I haven't seen well okay I have seen one on the internet okay really yes what site was that?

boner.com I was called bonerjams.com with the Z right?

with the Z they're pants that you wear to hide your but I don't think the boners that I I don't think the boners that I saw wait hold on I want to go back to these pants what are you doing to say?

how exactly do they hide your boner jams or pants that hide your bones? are they pants that extend past like as far out as your boner or do they have a reinforced panel that puts it up?

the clamps it down? right like the spanks you tie a there's a strap that goes around the front end of the boner do you need a boner before you get into them?

no but you do I'm really not sure I mean I'm familiar with the product I don't own them and you're the spokesperson? I've seen the infomercial and I've done some voiceover work but I don't know it's something about a strap and then the strap is in your pocket and you pull it to the side for emergency so some kind of like almost like a parachute if all of a sudden you get a boner you pull the strap and it apparently which way the strap goes depends on the natural curvature of the boner I have a little to the left I should get those pants for this guy Harlan Kobeck he sits in the back of our class and he always puts a windbreaker on his lap because I think he's like got boners all the time it happens maybe his penis is cold then get like a penis warm or something don't let me see it now you're the spokesperson for that product penis warmers? not anymore it's just a little microwave that you put your penis into you know they have a lot of lawsuits depending so it usually makes the penis explode yes but if it doesn't you have a nice word of penis all you do is you put it seems like a really big risk it's a terrible risk it depends on the setting it comes naturally a tune to 10 but you always have to remember to set it to 3 right right exactly I would just get a piece of fleece or something and sew it on or something that's a great idea I wonder if you thought of that which one are they?

they crawl in there you get a boner tone tone that's a good idea are you guys more comfortable now than we've been talking about boners hold on let me get my comedy journal out talk about boners number one win it win around guys win around guys that's all we talk about when the girls are away I hope my stepfather how many boners you get yesterday I got about three and a half oh my god I had 16 and three quarters you know the only thing I enjoy about coming to this show is that it reminds me that it's not so bad not to have a boyfriend what does that mean?

hanging out with guys and just talking about boners little change in other things too there's farting oh god when we're in win around our significant others it's more like you know will you touch my boner?

right right right right we paint a picture of it we paint flowers on it we make it look like a UW-Foss in the 60s it's more feminine and more inviting they feel more comfortable with it something to look forward to number nine nabbi-scow that was number nine what did you think of number nine?

I liked it as the Beatles said yeah that's right that's how that song ended right number nine as the Beatles said here we go how was it thinking number nine?

oh I didn't gather it who are you?

you know they're John Lennon the biggest creep in the world oh that'll make next year's the last I'm sure was not eligible oh any not eligible we go by the way we just did or we go from Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving oh I see I see so that epic so with Aaron Hayes and Ben Telfur that will be available next year for next year's voting wow wow that means last Christmas's show is eligible it's edible so go out and yell it go out and yell it everyone yes please do and we may get to that we may not who knows if people voted on it who knows indeed could be someday mannon you know what I'm gonna do Paul?

I think I do but you tell me tell the listener go ahead I think you're gonna introduce this next clip I am but you may be thinking I'm gonna introduce clip number eight yeah I mean we've heard ten and nine uh-huh guess what change up bonus clip change up that's right several times during these shows I'm gonna be introducing bonus clips and these are not from episodes that you have voted on well you did vote on them they didn't make the top ten but they're uh certain parts of a show that I wanted to highlight that were really good that maybe the episode didn't get voted in but this uh is definitely a highlight sure so like the audience votes right yes and then you look at their vote the new listeners all the fucking idiots you missed some of these great moments it's a little more cynical than uh perhaps my actual mental state but sure well I call it like I say it's gotten you calls it like you sees it as I recall I forgive I recall calls it like I sees it and you were calls correctly as I sees it as a season as I re-season oh the biggest grape in the world is here uh this is from episode 115 this is uh my friends Paul Rudd David Wayne and Ken Marino and this is the first time we did this this is a new feature on the show this year but uh we started freestyle wrap contests and this was the very first one and uh you'll hear myself you'll hear David Wayne then you'll

favorites on this I love the feature bonus now was that the was that the longest and most successful freestyle rap it was definitely not the longest the Christmas the Christmas episode well yes from last week was the absolute that's just but you know what I mean who won the wasn't then completely insane it didn't involve 80 people I don't know that it was the longest but it was uh I was surprised Paul's rap was probably the most successful yeah he was actually the best at it that we've had Amy's was pretty good too Amy Paul was really good yeah yeah I would say though like on a technical skill yeah level that Paul was goat yeah great football time yeah sorry I'm afraid that the new listener thinks I'm not cool and I didn't get that acronym but of course I knew what it meant okay well did say something you like that is cool and they'll know you're cool slap bracelets okay well I don't know pretty cool though uh yeah but uh Paul was amazing at it and uh David Wade actually really good at it too absolutely yeah me not so good I think you underestimate your overestimation of yourself you were terrible like yeah accepted can I say yes we're four clips in including the bonus yes no sign of Paul f-topkins three no only three clips we have 10 nine and then the bonus I crave your indulgence and I beg your pardon this is a fantastic segue because this episode does not include Paul f-topkins but it includes a friend of yours you don't say a good friend of yours let's hear clip number eight no let's not hear the clip let's hear the music for clip number eight yeah number eight number eight bro um this is a good friend of yours a Hollywood director is it mr. Gary Marshall it is mr. Gary Marshall how did you meet Gary Marshall by the way Gary and I first met I have auditioned for just about every movie that he has made sure and uh I've been lucky enough I mean for since childhood you know his first movie Young Doctors in Love I think I was eight years old and I auditioned for that film um for one of the leading roles which was well of course I wasn't gonna get it well all those roles were written for adults there wasn't like a doogie houser important it's not at all oh this this movie prefigures doogie houser that's right um I keep saying I'm on this terribly where I'm using the term prefigures incorrectly oh really okay what is prefigures prefigure I think means something else um but this is your good friend Gary Marshall you met him you've auditioned for everything yes never been cast in anything never been cast in anything and no hard feelings he was one become friends with someone if you're well because we just were seeing each other so much and I would come and be like hey it's this kid again you know and he's a you do a Gary Marshall impression at all like I do but it's it's like hey it's this kind of girl yeah not great yeah that's not good right so uh please don't tell him I did that okay yeah I know that's embarrassing so yeah so we've become friendly and he's a nice guy and he's always like I'd love to cast you something I'd love to cast you I'd love to cast you for me a little Italian spit on that hey I love the girls you know he's Jewish no he's Italian oh okay he's Italian Marshall is not his real last name really what is it it's something Italian Maffungu it's probably Maffungu from under from under your balls bro all right so this is our number eight clip we did we did the music for number eight right let's hear it again it's great let's hear it bro and this is from episode 126 this is John Ham from Mad Men was on the show and Gary Marshall dropped by and this is sometimes on the show one of our favorite features on the show is where we play would you rather absolutely and this is where we play would you rather with John Ham and Gary Marshall and I think you're gonna enjoy this I know I will re-talk to me number eight it's time for one of our favorite features here on the show it's time for a little something we call would you rather watch that where's that coming a fanfare for to not common man please don't talk during the things that we have my own game all right it's time to play would you rather and we all know how this is played people send me would you rather scenarios to our Twitter which is CBB WIR comedy bang bang would you rather and I read them out loud I'll open the floor for questions you can ask me any question you like about either of the scenarios and then I'll shut down the floor we'll vote we'll tally up the points and everything will be all hunky-dory but that would never end so I'm gonna do something I've never done before on the show I'm gonna do a combo question what's this now you seem very suspicious but I am people send me questions all the time and sometimes I like one of the scenarios but I don't like the other one like I think one half of it'll be funny you mix it up so I'm gonna combine I'm gonna combine two people I think that's your progress so you're not only a crowd source the material then you pick and choose so uh I say it's not good enough yeah yeah partially good enough uh so this today's question is going to be a combo from Amos Hunter whose Twitter handle is happy Amos fun combined with Tony Wirt who is Wirter WIR TER if you want to look him up him or her Tony what a long he's been an Amos Hunter I outcome the one guy doesn't call himself Wirter's originals you think he ever goes around hunting for a red October at all or hope so did they have a catch that by the way they never did all right here we go they ask what would you rather they ask would you rather always laugh to the tune of the mash theme song or have Tony Danza appear as a devil slash angel on each shoulder for every decision you make would you all rather always laugh to the tune of the mash theme song or have Tony Danza appear as a devil or angel on each shoulder for every decision you make I'm opening the floor for questions I have question that's commercial I'm afraid I was not looking up I did not see your finger John I saw that he had his finger raised that I went in and undercut him so that I could get the first question it I know you love to get the first I'm very competitive yeah all right what's your question then in the scenario where I laughed to the tune of the mash theme song uh is it in tune do I do it well or is it a a tonal in this scenario you have perfect pitch so you are able to do it in tune with harmonies anything you want I gotta follow up okay is here every time where I do the vocal version from the movie including the words so it just seems like I'm singing this gets along to my question as well okay yes there is there is a time but it's only when someone very close to you is committed suicide and you're at their funeral I got one more question okay one more what happens when I cry that is a great question you actually cry tears that when they drop down they resonate that vibrationally into the Sanfernson theme song yeah does that go for tears of happiness as well no tears of happiness they play here comes the bride what about tears of excruciating pain tears of excruciating pain these are three kinds of tears yeah this is the green acres theme song but uh with the lyrics yeah john you have a question it's a very simple question uh in the in the aforementioned scenario both versus how long do you have to keep laughing uh in in less you're at your friend's funeral sure uh you just laugh the the normal amount that you would laugh for anything in fact I'd love to hear you try to laugh thanks a lot of press it's all uh uh um I think we learned a lot about that I do have one question about the first scenario hell read his face guy it's like he just got back from Bermuda what era Tony Danza this is a classic Danza this is who's the boss taxi or boss no I'm sorry this is classic meaning who's the boss and he addresses you as Angela let me answer he addresses your uh right ear as Angela and your left ear as Samantha okay does he give uh the angel and the devil yeah do they give advice when you have to make a decision or do they just appear there and it's creepy they appeared everyone who's looking at you uh and uh oh I don't see them no you don't see them at all everybody else ever on else see them anytime I have to make a decision they appear everybody else so do I even they're miming do I know that they're there no no no and no one has the heart to tell so I never know when this happened follow up yes are they in costume they are they're in Halloween costume but uh those sexy uh and slutty slutty slutty okay yeah so garter belt uh Danza was a fit man could tell yeah he can I hear them oh uh yes you can hear them as like slight murmuring uh and you assume that you have some sort of mental disease where you're so I never figure out through my whole life that this is what's going on people all of a sudden looking at me strangely it's some murmuring and you check yourself into a mental hospital before I wreck myself into a mental hospital of course you do and you lick it before you kick it and all of the above and uh yeah and it pretty much ruined your life and you spend uh your golden years uh with uh two dances does boy you got excited do I ever have to make a decision in front of Tony Danza great question uh they turn your plight into a tv movie starring Tony Danza and then you uh play the angels on his shoulders but nobody tells me this is based on my life no of course not you never you die not just happen to get a great job you're and you're constantly like I wonder why they would hire a mental patient oh this is after I've gone crazy in the sanitary oh yeah yeah you're in the sanitary you're in the rubber room and then all of a sudden you're plucked from what you think is obscurity and you have a great acting job they'll allow how long does a tv movie last oh the weeks yeah probably we're talking lifetime we're talking uh homework all of a lifetime yeah it can last a lifetime okay they're saying correct that stuff out at lifetime they got it down to a science yeah yeah so it's more like yeah it's more like a bees lifetime they use a lot of the same scenes uh in the lifetime movies there's a then the middle of the movie it's the same thing every time really all of them have merit us bastard bernie in them so there's there's it's just easy to plug and play she just backs the now because she made some discoveries about herself uh ladies so we're talking about john some sexy discoveries no that sounds great is there a lifetime everybody loves sexy discoveries i mean there was a channel i'd tune in i would watch a movie called sexy discoveries or plug and play starring her i think i think that's the subtitle uh the no more plug and play for her sex and discoveries core like rub and play back to the gate oh here we go when uh the mesh scenario huh maybe we should laugh again when i let's save it for a time we really need it when uh do i ever laugh in front of any of the cast members of mesh you do uh if you're moving uh the tv show but only the after-mash cast members so we're talking uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh christopher i know them by their character names clinger potter and uh of course uh father mille kehe William christopher what William christopher oh father mille ke all right so uh yeah those three and how do they react to this so they offended are they delighted they say always nice to me to fan and how do i feel about laughing this way do i enjoy it you love it you uh it it brings it brings great mirth to your life it actually encourages you to laugh more often because you're a very sad person what if i go to uh comedy movie and uh i'm really enjoying getting uh laughing uh the smash theme uh do i get do i get thrown out of the movie theater what happens people get upset i bet no they get upset but they they don't throw you out of the theater they escort you to the other theater where mesh is playing in a revival house would people like that any better of course they were they're trying to watch match because it's all over the film people kind of uh they hear you laughing to the mesh theme and they nod and go hey you know we get it if it if it had to be somewhere at least here another question about the laughing is it uh do i have to say like you know how you have a different uh length of laughter based on how funny you think something is sometimes you think something's a little funny you just asked an answer let it laugh i feel like this was the first question but go ahead oh was it really asked an answer oh i well but okay well what's your Gary Marshall spin on it that we want to hear i can't remember the wording of the question was it every time you were too busy following up your original question look you got to get in there are you say you realize by the way that i don't award points just for the questions you ask no i understand i understand but it's i'm trying to the speedier i get in there with my questions the more information i have i feel like i'm more confident you're a great player you're a great player i don't follow up because i i think this this does bear a huge amount of despair mr mr marshall has a lot of history please call me thank you thank you Gary uh has a lot of history with both not only Tony Dansa, Catherine Helmand, uh uh alicia Milano, uh alissa, both of them both of them uh so uh does that do they bring any sort of personal resonance into into this because i don't want to be have sort of a weird there's a question whether or not this guy has a little influence over what happens on my shoulders if i'm guessing you're oh you're putting me into this scenario this is a precedent scenario tell me i'm wrong you're i'm sorry what did you say we're both both in the scenario might might he has a sort of prejudicial knowledge of all of these characters right having worked with them uh along some meaning if you both choose and also at universe this is uh what if in this universe i don't even exist this is my question this is my question uh bricklayer well here's here's what happens okay if you both choose this scenario then Gary Marshall is in the scenario and uh he has prior knowledge of tony dansa and the whole cast and it kind of ruins it for you because you're not special anymore however if he does not choose it then you're the only one and you uh not only you become the mental patient and you start in the tv movie but everyone loves you got it but no one loves you if Gary Marshall chooses this thing so it's time to vote no wait it's well okay all right here we go i think we should do it the same time then because one that's right it's a lot like poker you want to declare at the same time all right so we're gonna uh ask you to vote at the same time what is the arb or or dansa tears or what is it it's uh uh it's uh it's mash laugh mash mash laugh yeah dansa tears dansa laugh it's laugh left dansa left dansa so uh so finger fly left dansa it's a beautiful area so hold up one finger for laugh two for dansa this is on the radio yeah i know but i'll judge it i'll judge it and we're and we're gonna we're gonna go five four three knows one and then vote okay all right now yes one finger four one for laugh two for dansa okay and i'll be what about the thumb does not count does not count okay so it's got to be the fingers all right so on the count i want you to say it with me five four three knows one and then shoot all right are you guys ready i'm ready mr marshall i was please call me gary thank you so much gary are you ready i'm ready all right mr ham i'm ready all right here we go and five four three knows one shoot okay let me describe what happened john ham picked the tony dansa scenario and in a surprise upset mr marshall i picked the let i was kind of waiting for you to say call me gary oh this is it i think it calls for mr marshall all right mr marshall moment mr marshall picked the mash laugh that's right so a happy ending here for john ham and an unhappy ending for mr marshall because he chose incorrectly but uh but i i chose with my heart you chose unselfishly so uh there we have it so john you're our winner congratulations thank you you played a good game thank you i thought it all came down to that shooting i tell you if you'd only pick the other one well then it wouldn't have been as good for john in that reality number eight oh that was fun huh heard it i'm bragging i'm bragging that i just heard that clip what if every listener had that kind of reaction to every clip oh that sounds like a horrible curse to live under the that's like you have like a compulsion yeah yeah yeah heard it heard it oh yeah heard it ah ah ah as burgers people are compelled to shout out the name of the disease what if you if you had aspergers you had this thing where anytime you exhibited uh aspergers behavior you had all about like that and you had to make like a slam dunk motion with your ass like aspergers of course you're very fat aspergers slam dunk speaking of slam dunk's that clip was a slam dunk i'll say good clip freestyle rap battle in that one as well there was yeah check out that episode for the freestyle rap battle uh john ham also bales similar to ken marino yeah yeah yeah i think as i recall he did something he did some noises yeah yeah we all look to each other during that one and kind of we're like oh none of us are good at this i thought gary marshall is pretty good i mean he's funny he began his rap with my name is gary marshall i'm here to say clasagrap beginning it's fun to rap in an old school way is that where you're with it i don't know a terminal way oh yeah but that's of course where that that title of that episode was uh was a suicide is painless that's where we sang the suicide is we laughed the match the suicide is painless uh funny clip but you know what it's reminiscent more about that one episode instead of going to clip number seven i bet you know what i want to do are you you're not going to throw on a bonus clip bop bop bonus that's right paul it is a bonus clip uh this is another one of our patented bonuses you did get the patent on these i did yeah it was pending for a while man oh man i was worried somebody was gonna scoop you up there yep no scoop for you speaking of episodes uh okay this is uh episode 122 uh and uh i couldn't let a best of go by without having our good friend zak alphanacus on the show or he's uh one of the biggest stars in the world absolutely star of uh uh these movies called the hangover hangover films the hangover trip ditch by jk rowing hopefully hopefully i don't know what i mean by that i'll take any message of hope though no these trouble times yeah that's right it's a problem right so this is from episode 122 this is uh i was talking to zak and uh the band yolatango yes every once in a while we'll have musicians on the show and uh yolatango was here and uh we had a nice little conversation this is a a short conversation but i wanted to throw it in there this is bonus from episode 122 zak do you have any questions for yolatango i do but i i feel like they they've heard i feel like i've already or i've asked i heard this before okay but i don't want to i feel like they probably get asked this a lot no go ahead though i know the answer so i just love uh that song and i don't know if this is the right i love the song about tony orlando's house thank you it's it's from a simpson's thing right yeah yep that's the answer it's uh it's a line from it's a line from the liannel uh sorry the uh tori maklure filmography let's say tony orlando's house uh i guess is uh telephonography uh zak uh did that answer your question oh i already knew the answer is that maybe that's your point is that why am i asking a question that already yeah ask something you don't know the answer to uh what is the capital of balawi oh no i know it long way there is nothing you don't know is there you can't stop me especially if i know the the questions what's the last thing you bought zak last thing i bought mm-hmm like uh besides food um okay i'll exclude that uh besides all the food molasses uh bell bib devote tickets there that is not a joke they're on tour now oh they are yeah they are how do you know that because i keep up with modern culture oh i don't maybe modern is stretching it yeah jeez what a terrible bragger ah zak tell me we weren't rolling we were just making fun of zak wow that close this flag the same way we were making fun of him during that type you got me fun of a lot during that episode we none of us stopped doing it even yellow tingo got it on anything y'all at tango played uh three or four songs during that episode two so if you're a fan of them uh check that out that was sounded great they sounded amazing and uh that was a really fun fun show to do episode 122 it's fun to chew but let us cast aside fuck you let us cast aside the uh bonus clips for the moment and count it down once again to episode number seven number seven oh number seven is here oh lucky seven lucky number seven that's right so that was the name of a movie for real like they thought that would be good to do they focus grouped it yeah they're like that's clever yeah what was it because someone's name was sloven yes yeah it's not like you're you know calling your movie lucky number citizen cane yeah it's not it's not a beloved character that we all know yeah who they made a sloven movie i mean if they called it like lucky Harry Potter maybe i'd still go because i love that character you'd probably be tricked into going he's not in that movie this is from episode 131 and uh this is an episode where i had my good friend Jason manzukasan and Jason you will be hearing a lot more uh regarding Jason in the coming year because he is in the Sasha Baron Cohen movie the dictator where he plays i believe Sasha's best friend or co-conspirator and so you're gonna be if you don't he plays the vice dictator yes secretary of dictation if you don't but not reading if you don't quite know who he is you're gonna know who he is and this is a this was a really great episode we were having a lot of fun and then some weirdo walked in oh why does that have to happen and this was chip gardener walked in oh yeah let me explain who this guy is he wanted to become the mayor of Hollywood the honor mayor of Hollywood mister holliwah holliwah and he he came in trying to get some votes and trying to get the vote out uh in order to become the honorary mayor of hollywood canvassing but then uh a lot of stuff came out about him first of all he had a really weird face yeah his face was uh uh facially reconstructed and kind of leaking and uh very strange bone structure and then we uh also i should set up that uh we found out that he was the host of a children show named zap in the 70s and uh so those are two facts pertinent to this clip but uh you're gonna hear he's just a strange guy in oddball that you know that paul was talking about before oddball goofball and uh so we're gonna hear this clip right now it's episode number seven on your countdown holliwah number seven this is comedy bank bang we're here with Jason menzukas and we have um chip gardener who uh we had a great talk uh during that song and everything's cool yeah we're a hundred percent cool in case anybody in the audience is nervous yeah so don't worry about us we truly are three great friends now great friends great friends terrific i want to talk to you about your campaign because i sure uh it seems like your only strategy that you've had so far is for people to write to someone like an actual letter absolutely nothing is more impressive than sitting down at a typewriter and typing out a letter and putting it in the care of the united states post office all this various technology we have today is just fine but if you really want to impress someone give them a hard piece of paper in their mailbox and that really gets a message across is that a euphemism sign up is that a euphemism chip giving someone a hard piece of paper in their mailbox sounds like a euphemism ah well i didn't mean it that way if you really helps me to get the job of honorary mayor of hollywood for someone to go down there and and just just jam it in their hard piece of mail and somebody's goddamn way mailbox i would say i would say go do it and tell them chip gardener sent me oh okay if you like that fucking you've got chip gardener to thank for it because he sent me here to fuck you so considerate of your it sounds like part of your campaign is to advocate people go down to the chamber of commerce and just fuck people listen it's not about you in your name do not know the chamber of commerce right there on hollywood boulevard can you just fuck anyone you want to these days okay such a good question scott like i'm putting that in the like great question that's in the win column that's in the win column it's such a great question chip i'm i'm interested to hear your answer well if i'm not mistaken the supreme court recently rolled on that uh... and rule yep and i believe they said yeah you can you can go ahead and you go ahead and fuck whoever you want yeah yeah and there's no legal uh thing that anyone can turn to to tell you that that like i didn't enjoy that fucking well as i understand it and i might be wrong but like it's not about them enjoying it right it's not about because like when when you're parking someone it's about you it's about car do you it's about you taking what you want in the name of chip gardener in this instance hey i say wait whoa whoa whoa hold on well on one second because i think you just said something that i want to pay very close attention whoa whoa whoa whoa and point out for the list whoa whoa whoa stop the clock what's that you said two words that if people and and maybe people want to rewind yeah maybe you just press play right here and i love it you got that to help me just join us you know what i just realized i coming out of that song we didn't do we didn't identify anything so people who just tuned in at this point have literally no idea they would be absolutely bewildered yes but you said two words and usually i the the combination of which leads me to believe that you have some freaky freaky things going on i'm talking like we heard the same thing scott so i think on the count of three we should say those two words together okay ready one two three chip gardener wow you guys really are bros jacie come back he's lying on the floor is are you having a seizure uh wow that was beautiful um no but but you did say uh hell Satan that's right is that part is that part of your scene man oh absolutely yeah well one of the things that brought me back for my dark period oh there was friends and family of course but also the t-shirt friends the t-shirt friends and family two friends actually did help him come back from the brink because i saw that monkey i thought how about can things be when a monkey's got work but anyhow uh yep uh lord lord Satan was a big part of my recovery and redemption and how did you how did you first get into that well gosh i was down at a rock bottom and i uh i saw a fella is this before or after the jeep this was uh well after the jeep oh so you'd already been hosting these shows with the mask i've been hosting the shows with the mask i just want to just want to ask a quick question and i do want to get to your introduction to lord Satan yeah the jeep instance it was that the first time you attempted suicide oh that wasn't a suicide attempt i just wanted to get run over oh you just wanted to get over yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like for what for like for kicks just for kicks exactly yeah yeah just to see what i could survive because at that point where kicks just keep getting harder to find the kicks are getting harder and harder to find Herman's hurts yeah i was uh i was actually pitching a game show at the time called can you survive getting run over by a Monte Carlo was what it was why i was in particular i was hoping to get run over by Monte Carlo but it ended up being a jeep and in some ways your luck it was a jeep because of the four-wheel drive maybe you're right how so well because those back wheels were able to avoid you oh is that how it works yeah that's anytime a jeep hits anything the front wheels hit it but the backstone is that right that's what four-wheel is yeah i used to work uh at uh forward for uh maker of the jeep maker of the jeep for it for jeep no come on we come on guys you guys are joking around but we studied the jeep because we were afraid of it no your enemy yeah exactly we were as close to we were definitely afraid of it and we considered actually making a four-wheel drive for for a while and we were going to call it the four-wheel drive i love it and that yeah and i got paid three hundred thousand dollars to come up with that you talk too much about money you do you talk too much about how much money you make do you really think so like the story would have been totally a chip money shift can i can interrupt you for one second i i i i do i do want to hear this chip i'm sorry the story would have been totally viable if you had not said how much is that here's where i disagree put that to put the money in is bragging here's where i disagree has value otherwise here's where i disagree i got paid so much money that people should know about that no they don't need to know about that that's the part where you lose i don't think it's bragging when you're just stating a fact lose the common man when you just say how much money you make it's not important it's not bragging yes it is bragging you know how is that bragging didn't add anything to the story chip can you shut it it makes people impressed shut up i know you look like you want to talk you stupid weirdo i'm dying to get in there all right you know what i want to hear what he else is saying let's go what were you guys talking about don't worry about it sometimes i interrupt without knowing what you're talking about we're talking about we're talking about we just had a little disagreement chip back to lord satan yep lord satan you're in a dark place hmm yeah absolutely rock bottom you said uh-huh and the jeep wasn't rock bottom that's what i find interesting the whole facial reconstruction of the surgery going awry that was a drag that was a real bummer man yeah i know they accidentally gave you sexual reassignment surgery while they were working on your face and you're like i didn't ask for that i'm not entirely sure it was an accident it wasn't my idea i didn't want it but i think it might have been uh pranksterism on the part of the doctors but then as i understand it you went and have that uh not reversed because you can't reverse it but now you have both sets of genitalia well that's right you know neither of which they call it a side-by-side side they go to side by seep in the in and out secret menu i'm a side-by-side-er that's absolutely true that's all you got to say when you go to in and out and they they give you a free burger yep oh yeah i get free burgers all the time over there really well i'm a side-by-side-er and that's a rare thing to be oh that's so yeah that's right well i figured as long as i've got uh i've got a vagina and then so it's just as easy to put a penis on there might as well have both but anyway uh you know i've never even thought about this do you ever put one inside the other are you kidding me i don't think i am it's in there right now wait what absolutely all the time is that let me ask you a question yep is that for uh sexual pleasure or is it to have a good line in your pants because it looks it looks good thank you very much you can't yep well it helps with the pants but really it's i'm just in in a rapturous pleasure at all times real at all times as lord satan would want me to be of course because we have to make the most of our time on this earth that's the part where a lot of people don't like satanists but that's the part that i actually really agree with is that it's all about instant pleasure and just you know we're based just do you need to spit all over the microphone and table more just but just to make just to make this point and i'm sorry to spit but i when i get really emphatic i do so you just like produce so much saliva it's insane it's it's part of a glandular problem i have with no good please get rid of it all over the table and microphone but when you're on this earth there's nothing after this life other than health iron damnation so yep while you're here that is something while you're here you need to make the most of it and you need to be constantly just feeling and experiencing as much orgiastic pleasure as you can and that's the only part that i agree with um when it comes to satanists well that's ninety nine percent of it go out there and get what you want and uh to help with everybody else and just pleasure pleasure pleasure at all time and it doesn't matter what you do to anyone else no no this is the only thing that i agree with mm-hmm yep that's that's a lot of it right there now yep yep i need to know okay what is it that brings you into contact for the very first time with lord satan well i had lost my first wife uh she passed away she and i'm so sorry that is horrible it was terrible we were playing a game of hudini in the pool and she she went no she won the game and but it was in her contract that well scott before we go there i'm gonna ask just quick super quick question just because i'm sure a lot of our listeners don't know what is a hudini in the pool yeah no i know what is that game i just thought that was something everyone knew and i was going to ignore it that's that's yeah exactly that's so you know well wouldn't know the game is hudini but we happen to be playing it in the pool got it that's where you know what is the game hudini play you put someone in a plastic bag and uh well first you stab her and then you put her in a plastic bag and lock her in a trunk and throw her in the pool and say if you can get out okay so that is the game of hudini does take place in a pool uh it doesn't have to take place in a pool this this time it took place in a pool okay yeah sometimes that locked trunk can go in any number of places it can go in the ocean sure uh but there's water involved it can be buried or it can be buried in the earth okay absolutely that's sometimes worse than the ocean now this is is this a game you and you're uh now deceased first wife i'm so sorry to hear that yeah i had played in the past where she had managed to escape or were you guys first-time players the stabbing wrapping burying you know this was one of the rare times when uh the the very first time that we played hudini she did not make it out uh people play hudini all over the world really and enjoy it as couples it's a very popular couples game and uh and uh it's a party game like scruples a lot of times it's like scruples it's a lot like scruple a lot like baul dardash or jenga but this i mean that's it's just one of those rare freak occurrences where the very first time you try to play it boom the very first time we played it i think if i'm not mistaken yeah um william shatner played this game with his oh yeah i remember this my wife i remember that um you may be right so you but you played brian jones's butler played it with him oh really is that true that's exactly right oh wow brian jones's butler played uh hudini in the pool with brian jones mhm so you play it and it leads to your bottoming out yep that's right block bottom you say because of that no because i was sued by her family for a wrongful death and that just uh you took took my uh finances you know the uh what you have to prove for that in in just a civil suit it's just a preponderance of the evidence 51 to 49 it's not like uh beyond a shadow of a doubt you're absolutely right what you want that's where in this case just out of curiosity in this case chip yeah uh was it close or was it uh was it without a doubt my understanding is that it was unanimous finding on the part of the jury got it got it uh yes it had been a wrongful death and that i was the responsible party despite the fact that the coroner ruled it an accident my friend don the coroner oh corner don corner don yeah ruled it an accident but anyway losing all my my losing all my wife of course of course of all of her you lost all of your wife i lost all of my wife and that was of course uh i didn't care for that but losing all the money just out of curiosity did you keep any trophies did you keep like an ear of hers or anything did you keep anything to like remember her by you know uh i was heavily into her feet and i do have those you know what mhm something to be grateful for yeah yeah that's right i still have her feet to remember her i mean like i have like the letters and ex girlfriend wrote me yeah you know where's it where's the person keep those uh those are on the mantle and uh they're the right of the mantle as soon as someone comes in it's pretty much the first thing you see into real conversation piece i hang my index uh above my uh rear view mirror who's what do you hang there uh little baby boots oh i see uh baby boots yeah that's that's kind of the same thing i'll tell you something it's not easy to get a human being or even parts of a human being taxidermied you've got it there's one guy will do it out in international waters uh because it's just off the coast of san diego right yep he's out there yeah and uh yeah you go out there and you but he'll stuff anybody if you'll uh someone passes away and you'd like to keep them in your in your house posed in a certain pose he'll do that would be more than happy to do it so and that just because i'm curious now like is that something you've done subsequent to your wife's feet i've done it on several occasions yeah so walking into your let's let's let's let's do this walking into your home yep chip like what can one expect to see i would love to take a virtual tour of your home right now uh absolutely you walk into the house and uh you're confronted first and foremost by my beautiful fireplace and uh what kind of a finishes on that a bigger burden what kind of a finish yeah what are we talking about is it a tile is it a tile it's a tile old-fashioned tile on there what kind of house first of it like is i approach from the outside yeah i was a spanish style is it's a modern home it's a modern home uh yep it's based on uh on a prison in the 19 uh was i believe a prison of the 1960s that had a very unique design for a prison and so you had a home based on that same structure or you occupy a prison no no i spent some time in this prison and i and i uh i love it i absolutely loved it and i thought it was an interesting design for a person and so i i had an eye and called in the architect to a donut and i said make me a house and uh and they put a gate around it we've gun turrets and yep that's absolutely right mm-hmm it's right up there in the hollywood you've seen this i've seen this place it's one of the famous hollywood houses oh i had no idea that you live there let alone that you hired an architect to build it for you yep that's right mm-hmm now oh wait i think i know this house is this a house that like uh a number of times people have been imprisoned in and when they try and escape they are shot by guards as a matter of fact that's right you know your hollywood trivia i do know that just that's i'm only right only because on a number of occasions i've i've had to stop going someplace because traffic is shut down yeah because there is a quote-unquote prison break this was just last week from a home to that's mainly it's not really trivial and it just happened well listen these people are absolutely not held against their will these are a guest of mine in the house but if they leave unexpectedly there's a chance they could get shot okay see that seems like they are held against their will there's a real legal problem though you don't know the health care system there's a real you know you have a responsibility to your patients and you can't just let them leave wait patience you're saying patience as if they've been admitted to like uh you're your doctor aren't you well listen i'm a doctor of sorts i you know i thought that's why i thought yeah i i am all because i've heard about the owner of this house i never realized it was you mm-hmm but i heard about uh the owner of this house how he's uh the doctor in an insane asylum um that he turned his house into and uh i hadn't heard any of this this is actually really specific this is really interesting how urban myths get started because some of this is not entirely true it's not an insane asylum what am i getting wrong well what happens is that i'll uh i'll bring people over who are living on the streets and uh seem to have uh nothing to live for really and i'll just uh i'll do my best to to improve their lives through surgery okay see surgeries surgery procedures so it's not an insane asylum at all no more of like the homeless people have schizophrenia they have a lot of mental health problems absolutely what i heard from an asylum what i had heard is is that it was a kind of island of dr morro in the hills i had heard about these experiments that he's referencing you you switch a person's upper half for their lower half well we haven't been allowed believe me i wish we were that advanced we haven't gotten that far but we certainly have uh replaced a man's arm with a coyote's arm uh coyote's leg or things like that and we've you've you've turned everyone into a side-by-side as well we've done a lot of side-by-side stuff going on up there absolutely that's a that's yeah that's yep i'm doing that for their benefit do you think your obsession with these experiments is in some way an effort to find a way to fix your own goddamn face oh believe me and that's how it began absolutely i i bought a whole lot of surgical a lot of the surgeries that were done on my face were surgeries that i did myself uh if that's how it all began about surgical equipment i started reading up on uh skin and bone and you know i remember you you bought ancient victorian surgical tour how do you remember he bought that how do you remember that this is there's a big profit that's not a memory you could have there's a big profile on him it is not a memory la time you can't say i remember you bought ancient surgical equipment because that's impossible i remember reading the article about the la times wrote an article about my home okay then let me ask you this architectural digest has been over three times if that's the case yes why has it just come out now that there was such a long profile where he i didn't know this guy you how could you not have it was such a long profile i didn't know that this was the guy i just heard about the sixth centric but who did the hardy what hills the article didn't mention the game shows no no no they kept that out of it yeah i i told the journalist let's not draw in the past i'd like to talk about what i'm up to now yeah the surgeries on the skits of edicts and the homeless people and i got it what i did think was really weird about that article though was that there are a lot of weird things about that right side by side to the article there's another article about how all the ex-child stars of the tv show zap yeah uh had all they were all homeless living on the streets and how they've been disappearing yep that was an interesting confluence of events those two articles appearing side by side like what a terrible story to hear that those uh poor children though once proud warriors in my army uh we're now living on the streets and suffering through a mental anguish and mental illness and wouldn't it be wonderful to hear that someone had taken them in and uh helped about through surgery it would be wonderful but but it's just not one of the things that i remember about the tv shows app yeah is that in the show uh all the kids would come together and like a vultran and they would join forces it was kind of crude cgi kind of uh graphics but they would come together in order to fight an evil i'm just i just want to make sure there isn't anything going on now where in your experience you're trying to take those children and actually physically make them the mega man that they were in the tv shows app you're asking me am i uh taking some of these children or adults first of all he doesn't even he's not admitted to taking any of these children Jason oh okay sorry sorry hypothetically speaking would there be a case for anybody to be trying to actually build surgically surgically build the mega man now adults mhm ex children yep that's i guess what a lot of us are yeah ex children together into a large mega man war so you're imagining a scenario where some of these children are not imagining anything i'm just hypothetically or you remember stating are you remembering i remember the question on the table is have i taken all of these uh adults who are once uh members of my child army and child actors on zap up to my mansion which looks like a prison and is guarded round the clock by armed men who will shoot anyone who tries to leave and am i in fact putting horns on some of their heads and talons at the end of their hands and sewing them together one by one to create a gigantic monster with many arms and legs you've summarized our query precisely it's really it's a you know it's as simple as that well done synthesizing all of this information into one cogent point and you're asking if i have done this perhaps you're surmising that i have done this in service of satan so that lord satan may rule supreme over the earth so that you've been knights in satan service or if one was to be if one was to want satan to arrive here on earth you might need a vessel for him to occupy that is more than human well absolutely because when say you are if this were the case would you be lobotomizing these children as well so that satan could take over uh the corpses a little more easily well it would certainly be helpful to destroy their will wouldn't it so that uh they would have a very difficult because this is how many different souls are we talking about mmm perhaps 28 different souls 28 different souls satan would have to simultaneously occupy in order to rule this monster meanwhile uh recent medical studies have stated that if you lobotomize a child or an ex-child and give them just the bare minimum of motor functions that they're actually able to operate uh machinery and and their own bond their own bodies without having much uh of what one considered to be a soul yeah or free will mmm without revealing uh why i will tell you that that is absolutely the case that uh that absolutely we won't ask any further questions i'm not gonna follow on that your theory is interesting because it would be true that uh satan has failed to come to earth for all this time an argument could be made because in order for him to come here he would have to inhabit the body of of a single human being who would whose attributes and skill single human being would not be powerful enough to take over the world precisely take a look at that ridiculous movie uh the extra system of what value was it to satan to uh to inhabit the body of a 13 year old girl or the old man now even more ridiculous right and so uh yeah the theory might go that uh it'd be better for 28 simultaneous souls to be stitched together into a monster that has been created with extraordinary powers now you know you know what i think is really interesting is Jason and i we were talking about this and when we first met that we we thought we had just met each other but we seemed familiar to each other and you and i what we didn't talk about uh at the top of the show is you and i have something really weird and common which is we're amnesia acts sure um retrograde amnesia yeah and we don't remember our lives um when we were young children nope and neither of us have any record of of what we did or where we've been i don't have family no in fact uh all our families uh basically died when we were very young so i i would assume i don't know so it's almost as though your memories were stolen yeah so i mean that's just a weird fact that i wanted to bring up yeah i've often thought of myself as a victim of memory thieves and he's never occurred to you that at some time you might hear a message that uh flipped a switch for you and gave you commands i you know what i haven't i've thought about it a little bit because because i've heard a combination of syllables every once in a while that feels like a tickling in the back of my brain you know have you ever felt like a brain is being taken okay see see that's interesting you say that does this happen to you do people come up to you sometimes like after a show or something you've been doing and say man i loved you on zap they say that to me literally every day so weird because i don't know what it means remember anything about that no i i have no idea but um maybe one of these days you know i'll because people are like what happened to the 28 other people that were on that show i see you and scott ockerman out there and there were 30 people on that show they will say that to me all the time but they say Jason men's hugas not what happened to the other 28 and i'm like jumbo this is absolutely a face of it hey chipped can you shut it for a second one i have to say it's very important okay i have to say just shut up oh shut up you don't know what we're talking about so why don't you just like i feel like i'm like shut because i feel like you and i have this in common i i guess i didn't realize it but people all the time are like of the 30 zap cast members yeah the precisely 30 what happened to the other 28 because they were they were not the stars that you and scott were i know you don't like it when i interrupt but i swear to god i come on man your face is leaking please clean it up can't control that uh yeah people say that to me every day and what what's really weird is you and i talk about this every night right before we go to bed right and about how weird that is and we comfort each other and we say you know what one of these days we'll figure out exactly i'm itching to get in there and just do what i can do with a god ship i feel like where to god okay i think we're pretty much done like this part i've got something to tell you this very very important you know i'm a very mayor of hollywood chip that's i'm gonna vote for you please well you can vote it is not an elected position but let them know down there at the chamber of commerce when you stop by to fuck them let them know the chip gardeners sent you and that he would be a fantastic honorary mayor of hollywood number seven boy that crazy huh that that crazy that shit cray i mean cray um that shit cray cray i know that was uh that was uh a very fun clip very fun show to do uh went went uh very nuts there at the end it uh nuts is not even the word for it uh huh it went loony tunes that's two words for it it went shithouse it was built like a brick shithouse built like a brick shithouse which contained a crazy rat ha ha ha so that was episode number seven on your countdown and uh you know what time it is fall uh i i don't know what time it is time for another bubble bonus that's right it is another bonus clip uh and this is from episode 86 which was our first of 2011 our first episode of 2011 and my guests were pat and azwal to you uh are probably watching in young adult right now while you're listening to this yeah why are you doing that it's a movie what are you what's wrong weird i'll knock it off listen it's a good movie just turn off your head your your ipod your whatever right now and watch the movie you know what i've been seeing lately in these amc theaters amc is a chain i don't know if it's national or if it's just uh local to california don't know but they have uh an advert advertisement before the i think in the east coast it's called helman's they have an advertisement before the uh program before the main presentation where it it has a guy with a phone coming in and the usher tells him to leave his viral videos uh it's like leave your texts your emails and your viral videos outside the who what who in their right mind is watching a viral video during a movie and also what about regular videos that haven't gone viral that's right are you allowed to watch those all you want are you only allowed to watch drunk history yeah oh this cat video nobody cared about it so i guess i'm free to watch it um in viral videos but speaking of viral this is a viral clip because this clip went viral this is the first time that we ever played a little game we call alive or dead oh yeah and uh pat and rob got very confused during it so i wanted to play this clip this is a bonus from episode 86 five and bro this is a new feature that we like to call alive or dead what is that?

groovy love this oh okay all right this is a new feature called alive or dead where basically what i'll do is i'll mention some celebrities and it's up to you guys to figure out if they are alive or dead and because it's a really edgy musical intro for a segment called alive or dead i spoke too soon by the way when i heard the little that little bell clang in the distance and then it turned into metal should have been more respectful basically because this is the first show of the new year we're gonna play it a little bit differently than we will play it in the future but this is alive or died in 2010 because we're kind of wrapping up great uh the previous year so uh so many last year there's so well especially after the bomb too does that does the bomb count yeah the way yeah anyone who was pre-bomb all right no anyway well yeah that is interesting because the bomb went off at exactly midnight yeah so i guess it's not i guess that was that was 2011 okay i mean i've just never had a year where i've more that last year was the year that i most ran out onto my front lawn and screamed at the sky take me instead yeah that's how many people like who for so you know let's play the game for something maybe i don't want to remember maybe we'll okay all right so uh i'll basically i'll say a name and you guys confer and and give me an answer all right do you think that any of these people before we even get into it ever played this game probably wow i hope so all right we're gonna start with an easy one okay kind of a softball all right so Dennis Hopper alive or dead dead yes he died a prostate cancer did he really yes uh 2010 oh wait and his wife was like at his bedside or no he what happened is his ex-wife came to his bedside and he was like get out of here something like he was trying he was trying to cut her out of the will i think before he died but he was unsuccessful now if you got prostate cancer that does that is that implied that you just fucked a lot and i think it's the opposite yeah i think it implies i think it's not i think it's when you don't um clean it out with you know regular flusheens that uh yeah if you want me to check you later i'll check you yeah you can clean out cancer by just no you gotta clean by checking monster sheets you got to clean out your prostate just you know squared it by the semen dumps they're all over la go to the

amateur i should go they keep raising it geez i was not aware of this any of this amateurs what do you need to be a pro at it well i i i i have a uh a pen light that i'm able to see tickets in and uh i have uh my depth perception is such that i also i'm able to walk downstairs now oh you got the fix oh yep congratulations what happened i i i apparently wasn't uh the trajectory of my eyeballs wasn't uh right the arc that the cornea formed right right and i wasn't looking down oh okay yeah yeah you got to just throw off the depth perception right that's been fixed though yes it's been fixed yes um there's some water right in front of you by the way feel free to huh there's some water oh it's glass water right in front very far away death no exception is very important for the rockets it's one of the things that we test them for we throw things at them and we see if they can deflect it we've they deflected how we throw balls at them we run the girls through a lot of different tests a lot because a lot of girls want to be rockets and would you like to borrow my kurtia for that saliva coming out of your mouth sure that'd be great yes i have been told i'm a bit of a ruler that's uh good uh that's that's some good ushering you know i i know uh some dinner theater uh people that are always looking okay for uh uh do you have any uh table waiting experience um no well i i was uh i used to be the guy who cracked an egg in a genuine Caesar salad that okay are you just for that uh huh well i guess with the death depth perception he wouldn't be handling cutlery and and things of that nature that sounds like a bowl of salmonella well it well i'll see what i can do for your yeah that would be really nice to come out of my hair i love the theater i think you three should team up i mean you have okay uh no you're really great you're great i i mean you're an actor you're a director you're an usher and i'm free you know this is like a new enigma force five this is you know a dream team of you know i mean what what could you guys call yourselves uh let's see ush director that's that's really good but maybe we can improve upon it i don't want any part of this dream team there's no girls on it no beautiful girls yeah how about the pod dwellers because we're a three-piece in this in a pad in this podcast i know what a bob doesn't know what a podcast is he he barely knows he's being recorded oh oh okay do you do know that this has gone out to several people and people have listened to these several people these appearances you've made several people across several people yeah they're which ones on the interwebs every time you drop by is it the volume of my voice it's a problem there is no there is no problem we haven't established there's a problem oh what are you talking about okay so uh don don's your name don de melo theatrical director huh don tell tell me a little bit about that show it is the christmas show here i love to hear how long have you been doing it i've been doing the christmas show now 18 years it's 18th year directing the christmas show before that i was directing an all new review in midtown for several years before that and then uh some of the girls i knew there were between five six and five ten and that's what you got to be to be a rockette they graduated to the rock cats and i went with them yeah i dragged you along gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous girls what is the uh turnaround for uh said gorgeous girls how many years how many years can you be a rockette before you burn out and fade away oh if you sweet if you stay sweet you can stay in the show for several years i don't see that happening you can't start making demands you can't stop putting your foot down you gotta be real nice and sweet gotta be a nice girl we're looking for nice girls you gotta keep your body nice wow uh i gotta keep those legs real nice you are what's all about the legs you are disgusting the women being seemingly it's uh yeah not unlike some of my directors before really you come across this it is the casting couch it is common yeah oh it's a common tale sure you guys ever see the christmas show it's real terrific yeah the girls come out and they do those high kicks in those legs are going up and yeah beautiful beautiful i tried to watch the rockettes once but the uh kicking line induced a seizure oh i'm so sorry for you i enjoyed it but they asked me not to return oh yeah we can't have that it's distracting because there's a lot of kids in the audience because they want to see the Santa Claus and the camel and the live nativity and you know that's all fiber for the daddies out there oh that was another thing that's why we have the girl it's the camel bit my cheek yeah oh sure that happens is that a common yeah sure well you know uh there have been several times where the animals have attacked the baby Jesus and we just go i'm standing in the booth i go blackout we got an animal attacking the baby Jesus blackout and do they give you a blackout sure they were there i get a hair finger on that it happened so frequently ready for it and is there an understudy and understudy for what for the baby Jesus yeah yeah we got six or seven babies back there oh well that's good a lot of babies i mean they've got a big budget so is it true that you coat the nativity babies and camel sugar before the show starts well this is turned into an inquisition of sorts that's never been found to be true and why would we want the camel to eat the babies i mean for crying out loud why would you want the camel's eat the baby for compelling theater well i mean look sure it does i mean i'll i'll concede that i was a west side story across the street just now and when uh one of the dancers dropped another dancer the the jolt of electricity that ran through the audience like they were seeing something live and real that's what you're after that was my argument for when i had a seizure i said that i could write i said listen i don't know if you remember this i said just about anything can give me a seizure i could do this on demand and i guarantee your guests a very memorable experience i wouldn't mind that you know what having a Santa Claus if you could if you if you looked a little more like Santa Claus getting you in a Santa Claus suit and having you have a seizure in front of all the children like that and then because you know what this is the thing if anything goes wrong in the show we bring out the girls anything goes wrong we say Q the mask all those sweatpants are that you're wearing oh i didn't even notice the sweat these are my lucky sweatpants i wear them every christmas season throughout the entire run of the show i didn't realize car heart made sweatpants yeah these are work sweat pants huh i think those they're tedious those have just been i think i think they're just very soft work pants i think they certainly wash them in the off-season it doesn't look like he does no because they're building up luck every year you better hope you don't get p e teacher leg in those sweats what's that now it's a rash it's a fungal fungal based rash that a lot of physical education teachers get from wearing the same pair of sweatpants we had a girl who got a rash on her legs i said get the fuck out we don't need you with your horrible brushing legs this show is all about legs all about legs what was that what was that densory's name her name was Irene and as far as i know she's dead i don't give a crap about her i says you're full of forgetting a rash got out yeah it's a tough business Broadway is very very very difficult oh it's really tough yeah absolutely you're gonna keep you body nice you gotta stay sweet gotta keep those legs real nice i don't want any back talk no back talk cue the girls and blackout i don't say do you think he i don't think he realizes there there are no girls here at the podcast yeah there are no women uh here yet that's a real problem i could get you a bunch of girls could you sure i could i could get we got we got look here's how it works we got 80 girls at all times ready for the show well we only need 36 on stage at a time that means we got all these girls in a holding pen with the other babies backstage and the extra camel and the extra camel sugar and you did yeah they got a bucket of camel sugar and a couple of goats swinging and it's the can't get the camel sugar now we got it we could we drag that out of them yeah this is like a great courtroom drama this is we and we got you in the cross-examination all right look yeah sure occasionally it's nice when things go wrong in the show so you can bring out the girls and i don't care what goes wrong some do i plant things to happen in the show that are mishaps so we can bring out the girls every once in a while sure i do i've as matter of fact i've never seen that show not have a mishap in it and well hey then thank you very much that's me doing my job do i sometimes make sure the guy doing Santa Claus eats something that's going to make him double over in gas panes so i can say bring out the carol sure i mean i've i don't know i've never really seen it but is the show different to every is a different year to year a little bit can you talk more about gas panes oh sure yeah now we're in bob's field of expertise you know once we when we hire a Santa Claus you know i just get to know them but really what i'm trying to do is find out his weaknesses so that i could you know if he tells me how i got a terrible sensitivity to gluten i'll make sure he has some gluten you know what i mean right before the show so he goes out there and he's incapacitated and we get to bring out the carol bring out the carol i'm right i'm right here sir you don't need to get so close to me anyway that's what i do number six wow huh right right right opinion don't amelow is a terrifying creature mm-hmm and i think he's from a weird forest i don't think he's a person that was uh and i was listening to that back and i was realizing uh i'd uh that that was the first time kick boss and don damello were in the same room together you don't hear a lot of kick boss in that clip but they were there together that's true and then you hear them again later in uh one of our episodes that's for sale uh the bummer shoot episodes yes the very last one of those three yeah they're together on that one crazy ending to that episode very crazy in yeah uh please uh go go check that out if you can uh that's a really funny one uh none of those made the cut by the way i guess i shouldn't spoil it but we put those were they ineligible they were eligible let me explain they were ineligible i will if you just shut up for one second i would like to hear your explanation here i go so they were uh we forgot to put them on the voting for maybe the so you did forget we forget yeah yeah for maybe the first three days which is when maybe the majority of the people voted so and it was the public was there a public outcry why are these bummer shoot episodes not eligible there was and then we put them up and then by then everyone had voted and so they didn't make the list but they're really funny and uh and then the other thing is because they are for sale yeah very cheap yes uh very cheap 999 i believe for all three episodes yes that's not bad uh three hours of comedy a lot of comedy uh because that maybe they are for sale not everyone has heard them so they didn't get uh voted on for that reason well i would say this they are for sale and everyone should hear them yeah i i wish that we would sell as many people as listen to this every week i wish that every single person would buy those because they are actually super super scott i wish so too well maybe we'll get our wish in 2012 maybe if we wish the same thing that will pack more weight with the fates or whoever's in charge and Santa Claus perhaps if we held hands while we wish that all right let's do it all right here we go you don't have to say it a lot alone let's let's wish silently why can't i all right god here you know i'll wish i don't know what all right i wish that i wish that oh wait i'm talking yes okay okay we who's gonna be quiet you you be quiet and i will do the talking dot the three two one i wish that okay now here's what's happening what's going on is that you're still talking we just agreed that you would be quiet i did we agree or did we agree to disagree oh we may have agreed to disagree uh that's the problem let's agree to agree okay i'll be quiet do we quiet now we'll do three no's one both of us were quiet right here let's started again all right so one of us has to wish yes countdown three no's one Where's

Good song.

Don't make it a ringback, though.

We actually sang jitterbug in one of these episodes I listened back to.

I have a vague memory of it.

Yeah, I can't remember which one.

The best clips of the worst.

Well, if they were the worst of the best...

...meaning they're the worst of the top ten...

Those were the worst numbers in ten.

So I see the way... I see what you're saying.

I see what you're saying.
