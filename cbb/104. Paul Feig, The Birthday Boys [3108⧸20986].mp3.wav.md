Coming up on the show today, I have the creator of Freaks and Geeks, and he is also the director of the upcoming movie Bridesmaids, which opens this Friday. Paul Feig is here with me the entire program, and that is not it. We also have a sketch group that Adam McKay has called his favorite sketch group, the Birthday Boys are here. They're all here on the program today, but first let us hear the winner of our theme song contest.

Ah yes, thank you Reggie Watts, that is the winner. You voted for it on earwolf.com slash blog or at least roughly a thousand of you did I that was number four the weird one I think as someone labeled it engineered dog you probably did that that is the winner and let me be completely and totally frank with you that was going to be the winner because it was my favorite anyway but it actually did win the poll so I'm glad I don't have to lie to you but that will be it thank you so much Reggie for doing all of our choices and do you hear that do you hear that that's you loving the new name I knew it I knew you would you finally love it it took a week but you love it our transition team has been working really hard to make it a smooth transition between regimes I want to thank you all for the love and support that you've all sent me about the about the change just everyone loves it and I really appreciate all those nice messages you all sent a lot of you super into marketing I never realized that wow a lot of people really have strong opinions on marketing look you know people hate change unless they're panhandlers then they love it but you know things things change names this is comedy bang bang by the way the podcast people come to accept change I mean we all remember how much people loved Valerie when it became the Hogan family that took off we're still talking about the Hogan family people you know I mean the change when myspace changed its name to Facebook that seemed to work out really well for them so I think this is gonna be an amazing time in a brand new era I'm really excited to buy it and that song is a big part of it I want to thank Reggie one more time and I also want to thank a gentleman who did our new logo and man the new logo is just incredible he is a really amazing artist that I met him a few years back at San Diego Comic-Con and I was just kind of prancing along my merry way in my elf outfit and I know we all know that's not true I don't I only dress up as Slave Girl Leia when I go to Comic-Con but I chanced by the I believe it was the Fantagraphics booth and he recognized me for Mr. Show and gave me some of his books and they were fantastic and then just recently at our Chicago show that we just did I ran into him there at the Comic-Con there and he again gave me some more of his books and his stuff is just incredible I want to say who it is it's Paul Hornschmeyer and let me spell that for you Paul of course is P I think that's an A following that up with the L and then Hornschmeyer is H-O-R-N-S-C-H-E-M-E-I-E-R and he's pick up his books if you get a chance but take a look at the new Comedy Bang Bang logo it's fantastic he did an amazing job with it and I want to thank him for it all right let's get to our first guest our finest guest I might say you know him of course as Sabrina the Teenage Witch is science teacher but in his off hours he managed to make somewhat of a dent in his show business community it'll never be like Sabrina Mr. Poole you know him of course has the creator of Freaks and Geeks he wrote several of those episodes by his lonesome including the pilot which is what creating a show means well you know nothing's done in a vacuum it's always it takes it takes a village as they say what if you did write that in a vacuum I know like a literally a vacuum I know probably would have died after about 30 seconds I don't have very good lungs I will okay we haven't gotten your name yet I'm still doing your credits excellent he is as a director he's directed Arrested Development, Mad Men, Parks and Recreation, The Office right yeah a lot of offices a lot of offices 20 episodes and then in the film arena Unaccompanied Minors and the new film coming out this Friday if you're listening to this when we put it out if yes if you're listening to it in the future it already came out and you loved it that's right I hope this one does not know those embarrassing things where it came out it like really bombed bad when you find this it's like an old playboy after dark with like you know Jerry Lewis is talking about how Sammy Davis Jr. he's gonna direct a movie for Sammy Davis Jr. and you never heard of it it's like oh my god I guess it didn't happen so so hopefully the film is Bridesmaids and we're gonna talk about it this is Paul Feig we finally got to your name thank you Scott I could not be happier to be here well I could not be happier you are here because I want to say that I saw Bridesmaids a few months ago excellent at South by Southwest oh good all right and it is and I say this without hyperbole the funniest film I have seen in many a year Wow excellent the entire audience went if I may say apeshit for it they we got a nice response it was scary because it was like 80% dudes in the audience so we're gonna like oh I mean we know we're not like a total we're not we don't consider as obviously be a chick flake but yeah it's certainly not I mean one would think from the title of it that it might be akin to bride wars or something yeah totally like that well we agonized a lot over what to call it I have a personal hatred against any sent a title that's like a sentence you know their best day of their life look at all these bridesmaids yeah exactly what's up with that or you know let's find out their names yeah and a story about them that's right so Judd kept kind of pushing for bridesmaids he's like everybody can top it you know go ahead but we just kind of all realize you know what it's it's you don't want to alienate the the woman audience and there's nothing worse than kind of like making a movie about women and like oh guys it's it's not for women because then all the women are like well screw you I don't want to see so you know it's so we just kind of went for it and called it what it is and knowing that it would kind of have an ironic photo that would sort of show you that it wasn't you know right yeah the whole campaign has the women who are in the film as bedraggled bridesmaids yeah exactly like they've gone through a horrible experience right like they're a tough gang it was sort of modeled on it on the cover that one of those remote the first Ramones album actually oh really yeah and it's so nice that those are out now because I had to spend a year of like you know what movie are working oh called bridesmaids oh I see their faces like no no then I have to do this thing like we see when the picture comes out it'll be ironic and it's like oh forget it I bet I can top the title yes super bridesmaids oh that's the sequel what it's really they all get superpowers yes because when you're listening to this many years in the future and the sequel will have come out and done even worse than the first one and it's like wow they're all bitten by radioactive wedding dresses did you read oh shoot I shouldn't have sent you the treatment no okay let's talk about the film a little bit it's first of all is Kristen wigs I would say her first starring role yeah definitely she's been hilarious in other movies Paul most recently I'm talking to you Paul most recently what what got it all right enough right Scott yes yes you know is she's a I mean I'm such an enormous fan of hers I actually I didn't even realize this I cast her in her first movie which one little thing called I'm gonna company oh she was in that I couldn't even say it that's why the movie was not a success because I'm gonna cover the most kids go I'm gonna say I'm a hominid so yes that wasn't if we did a show about when that was coming out and you listen to it then you would have had that ironic like wow that movie didn't do well I had a friend who told me that he had to record the DVD commentary for his movie the morning they found out it was a flop oh yeah oh yeah and they had to pretend that it was not a flop and yeah because most DVD commentary comment that you recorded while it's still in production you well you do I mean we're doing one for bridesmaids literally on the day of our premiere not the day we get released but the day of our big premiere right just two weeks before the release that's when you can get the cast together and you know it's what while you're working on it or around the time you're promoting it that's when everyone's together yeah normally a lot of DVD commentaries don't come out with you know the benefit of hindsight that's true yeah yeah that that sounds nightmarish actually I mean we we did the one for on a company miners when we had already been like torn apart by the critics so so that that was actually fun what's not somebody accused me being a racist because there was a you know one of the characters with this little black kid who was hilarious mm-hmm and they have this whole thing about how like you know oh we can tell that the rich girl when she's watching him is is literally thinking the n-word I was like wow you're grafting a lot of shit onto me man I would say she's figuratively thinking yeah yeah exactly just got all in her subconscious somehow he gleaned this so well I don't know well so Chris and wig is the lead of this movie and she also co-wrote it with her groundlings partner and what is her name Annie mom alone and she and she's in the film she's in the well it plays a nervous flyer on an airplane very funny hilarious and then the other people in the movie let's talk about you have Maya Rudolph playing her best friend amazing who is one of her best friends in real life right which was you know just such a boon for us because you know you were granted one boon I wish I use my boon chit and chit I said and that's an old-fashioned word like chicken inspector and gumption Wow years old exactly that you know that I should wear my beaver coat and my pennant now you directed man man when you were actually in the 60s yes exactly I got one in my time machine but anything about that cuz I always wear I've for at least 15 years I've always enjoyed sort of you're very Natalie dressed well thank you but I've always enjoyed the early dressed like Natalie it's not easy to find something that fits you know that little cap I always like the style of like the late 50s early 60s with a thin tie and thin lapels yeah you have a thin tie and a clip shiny type always done that for a long time but then you know so I went into direct in the first season of Mad Men we hadn't been out yet and I showed up in first of all first thing they said was oh sir castings on I thought I was there but then when it comes out now it comes out as popular so now when I wear the outfit I always wear people go like no Mad Men okay yeah we're like yeah trendy guy now it's actually that style start to go out so now I just look like I'm out of style yeah you look like oh god that loser you fashion world that happened to me after swingers because I used to sort of you know wear suits a lot and then and then I remember I had an old girlfriend who the I met her on a blind date and she went oh swingers I was like thanks for reducing me to a cultural stereo so now I just wear this kind of stuff see look at you well you are those on your wolf calm you can see what I look like tuxedo looks very nice a tuxedo t-shirt I may have fooled you not see we could be anywhere wearing anything people don't know it's the power of radio oh yeah let's talk a little in a radio this is hey it's a 45 45 wow it's actually 485 in the Southland either really hot or a time I couldn't tell if you're doing the weather or the time it's actually no class I had in film school 45 I think I still owe a paper for that back to the cast okay so they're they're both amazing but then you have the bullpen as they would say you're going to the bench and the people on the bench are just as funny as the people as the leads in the movie they're all superstars I got what we got Wendy McClendon Covey who people remember from Reno 9 1 1 the the beautiful blonde 9 11 exactly we have Ellie Kemper who now plays the receptionist on the office we have the amazing Rose Byrne who you know is a dramatic damages yeah or insidious yes that's right and that came out it's actually doing well so yes but she was great and she was you know we were trying to cast this role of you know quote-unquote the villain although it's not really we didn't want anybody to be too arch or anything but it was hard to figure out because the comedic women to do that role are very funny but it made it a little not as pretty is what you're saying no no I didn't say that no we saw beautiful women beautiful women but we didn't want it to be too mean or just you know one of those kind of you're saying funny women are mean yeah oh god digging me that shovel I need hip waiters in here we just wanted I thought you said hip waiters yeah oh there are actually that's right Juan is here he's very hip and serves a mean hamburger but yeah what so Rose was we needed somebody who was kind of you know could bring a third and fourth layer to the to the role and Judd had just done so you're saying women comedians a lay of very shallow wow I'm just it's just it's all over for me now but Rosa Rose is I this was the first time I had seen her in a comedic role I know she was in get him to the Greek which I saw after I saw bride's well that was how because I only knew her as a dramatic actress Judd said they were just he did you know produced Greek and they were just finishing it and he sent me down to the editing room said watch some of her scenes watched it and she was so funny I was like wow that's cool so he and she is hilarious in this movie I mean so funny you a lot of times when people take play the antagonist they don't get a chance to be as funny as she is well she's great she's a really good improper she has like comedic chops for in instincts for improv that are very similar to the ones that Steve Carell has when I work with Steve all the time who everything has to come from this super grounded place like she has to find the grounding of the character in a real and then she can react as that character for real but she just knows how to just do it behaviorally very funny so did she take improv classes at all does she have that background I really wondered that when I was watching want to find out because I'm curious about that you could have talked to her on set it well you know I don't interact with the actors see that's what my 80s are for I just drink martinis at the monitor how are they doing okay they're good very nice so then you also have from the Mike and Molly show the new show and she is a lot of people calling the breakout character of the film well I think they're all breakouts but Melissa is is unbelievably her last name McCarthy Melissa McCarthy of course she's great because that part was originally written differently and a man yes but strong enough for a woman yeah it was just kind of written a little more this kind of nervous woman who's tagging along with Annie and then sir we would sell saw a lot of really funny people who didn't feel like we quite had it yet and then Kristen who knows Melissa said you should see my friend Melissa she's a groundling people line up around the block when she performs so she came in with this character that was so different from what we had thought it was gonna be and just thought was hilarious it was kind of this like butch woman who's man-hungry and just like in Annie's face and it just it's you'll see it's yeah I mean every scene every scene not only the scenes with her in it but every scene in the movie just slayed at the the showing that I saw cool it was just and like you said it was 80% dudes in the audience and when we were all done high-fiving we watched the movie yeah and and yeah I mean it just just destroyed in and it was nice especially at the end of a long day at a film festival you know we were like the 1230 at 1230 yeah screening you know so people have clearly watched like eight you know movies the whole day I think the only person it weighed negatively on was the guy from variety the reviewer from variety who who the main thrust of his bad review of us was that the movie is not funny and it was kind of like okay I'm up for any criticism tell me that I did a terrible job I'm all up for that say the story arcs that theater that was like rocking with laughter is not funny so it was kind of like all right whatever but thanks for ruining our rotten tomatoes score you his one criticism not enough variety yes how's it how to rate on the variety meter not enough yeah I have to say to anyone listening to this go out and see it on Friday night opening night with a large crowd that because it's it's very difficult to watch comedy a lot of times I'll recommend a movie like stepbrothers or something and people will go you like that movie and then when I probe them on it they say oh I saw it two years after it came out by myself on DVD comedies especially are meant to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd yeah we really like to I mean we you know we're putting the movie together we do a lot of test screenings to make sure everything's working and try different jokes and all we you know we kind of based it on like how the audience is reacting which for a big comedy that's what you want to make sure you're getting big laughs and so it is a very fun shared experience I'd suggest you all go out it really is go see it this weekend because it was one of the best times I've had in the theater and you know you'll be punching your significant other enjoy thanks yes I like it dudes don't worry if your lady drags you to it you'll have you'll have a good time yeah you'll have a better time than they will exactly ladies only have a terrible time actually because you'll be laughing at women yeah oh you're gonna get in trouble get punched when you get home yeah so it's really great and are you already reaping the benefits of having a buzz-worthy movie out there of like are you lining up your next project yeah I mean there's definitely yeah there's projects that there's a bunch of fewer there are competing right now there's there's a couple that I want I'm developing for myself I mean developing to write and direct no right no so it's very exciting but it is this weird thing of like you know especially when you had some movies that haven't done as well everybody's like oh we hear it's really great but so it's all can we see it so there's like they don't sort of trust the buzz it's like well I can't show it to you because the studio won't let us so there's a lot of hey we hear it's great but we don't trust you at all but right it's fine well when it comes out people are gonna know they're gonna recognize and in your future projects that you're writing will there be little black boys and those or yes all horrible racist movies just that's maybe it'll be the reverse you'll have a black woman who yeah I know just like I can't believe I missed all the racism in this movie I sort of overlooked it all right well we're gonna be speaking more with Paul Feig as the show continues and coming up next after this break we will have local legends the birthday boys will be here and Paul you're gonna stick around the whole show sure except for maybe the last two minutes you told me oh yeah I can't be seen leaving last I'm just gonna stand and screw up their timing for other jokes so look forward to that just like throwing in tags that are oh yeah exactly hey what about this it's just repeating the joke and they say the punch line also repeat kind of like my style would people say about myself I don't find that at all my friend all right let's go to a song when we come back we'll have more Paul Feig right after this huge turtleneck in my

What a great song, huh?

Oh, that's my favorite song. Good beat. Can't believe you played that.

You guys shut up for a second. Okay. Until we introduce you.

Alright, my name of course is Hot Saucerman. I'm here with Paul Feig and we have a very special appearance here on the show now.

You may remember them. They were on the show a little while ago when we were still taping at Indie 103.1. Hello to all of our Indie 103.1 listeners, by the way.

And they played the wacky ding-dongs on an infamous show.

And you know them from their monthly Upright Citizens Brigade LA show.

And I believe Adam McKay called you his favorite sketch group, I think, because of your Funny or Die videos.

The birthday boys are here. Hello, guys.

Hey, how are you? Hey, what's going on?

Yeah, Mike, just feel free to not be anywhere near that microphone.

Are you scared of it because it's your namesake?

Oh, we're talking to Mitchells here? Good.

Yeah, Mitchells here, so you're going to have to talk into it if you want to be here.

There you go. I know that's getting awfully close to him to maybe kiss him.

It's like when Paul McCartney and John Lennon used to share the mic.

It's a lot like when I went to this Bruce Springsteen concert.

I don't know what happened, but I don't know if he's running out of money, but there was some sort of microphone shortage.

And people kept having to share mics. It was bizarre.

They're not charging enough for the tickets.

Hi, guys. Introduce yourselves. I'm Mike Hanford.

I'm Mike Mitchell, the guy who didn't talk into the microphone.

There we go. This is Jeff Dutton.

Okay. And have you ever met Paul Feig before?

Just outside here. Hello.

We go way back, exactly.

All right, guys, so you're here.

We're here. We're back.

Guess who's back? Back again.

Can I just mention that I was a bridesman over the last weekend.

Really? I was. Congratulations.

I was actually asked to be the maid of or man of honor.

Wow. Matron of honor, I believe.

Wait a minute. Turned it down. Oh.

Turned it down flat. Not enough money?

I think you just came up with the plot of my next movie, though.

Are there any bridesmen reflected in your movie?

No.

How'd you put it, Jeff? Were you just like, no, can't do it?

Or won't do it?

I thought it would be like, hey, that'll be a kitschy thing for me to talk about later in life.

And then when she was like, yeah, and you know, there's all that responsibility.

You got to do this. And I said, pass.

Terrible friend.

Well, that's a great lead off story. Maybe we should have done a pre-interview.

I'm not sure about that, but anyway.

So guys, what brings you to the show today?

Well, we're excited, Scott, because we did a little spring cleaning over at the house.

Now, wait a minute. When you say the house, a lot of people don't know this about you.

I know about this about you.

And you love this fact about us, too, right?

There's eight of you or seven of you?

There's seven of us.

There's seven of you and you all live in a house together.

Right.

Three of you are represented on the program here today.

You all live in a house in the valley in California together.

That's right.

Yeah, it's pretty kitschy.

Yeah, the kitsch value is through the roof, which you cannot sell out.

And you don't own the house, so if anything goes through the roof.

Well, that's the other thing about trying to sell is we don't own it.

So you did some spring cleaning.

Yes.

And why would I be interested in that?

Well, it's springtime and for one.

That is true. Okay, you're right.

If you looked around your studio here in Scott, you could use a little spring cleaning yourself.

You better hope the radio station inspector doesn't come around here because this place is a mess.

Messy, messy, messy.

All right, well, you know, I have to keep my gold in the corner and we usually hide that.

And, you know, there's a lot of stuff going on.

But you don't have to get on my case about it.

No, it wouldn't be. I mean, we're fine with it.

The wire is everywhere and the meat.

My DVD box sets of The Wire. Yeah, everywhere.

I kind of get around to watching those.

You like that show. Why didn't you direct one of those?

I still haven't watched that show.

Really?

I watched the first hour and I thought it was really good.

And then I and everybody's like, oh, you got to give us first hour.

But I will be watching.

They say that I think around episode six, it like locks in.

Yeah, that's what I hear.

Like, oh, I get it.

Exactly. I know a lot of people from it.

Really?

I've worked with them.

Exactly.

They all started in unaccompanied minors.

I worked with Idris and I worked with Amy Ryan.

Of course, yeah, Amy Ryan.

Anyway.

All right, guys, get back to spring cleaning.

Well, we came across some old pitches, some old outlines and things that we were working on.

So of sketches that you would do?

Sketches, feature length films.

Really?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Are you surprised, Scott?

Just by the fact that you've never written a feature length film nor had one produced.

We've never had one produced.

Never produced, but written a ton of them.

Oh, really?

Wow.

Well, you know, you have an incredible director here, a cinema director.

Let's hear it.

Let's compete.

Yeah, well, well.

My, my.

He could give you some sort of feedback.

What do you got for me, boys?

Sure, sure.

All right.

I'll start with the first one.

The first one, it takes place in South Africa.

And there's an alien spaceship that's hovering above this certain district.

The certain district?

A certain district in South Africa.

Oh, okay.

I get it.

I mean, it's still a little loose, but.

Not entirely fleshed out yet?

Not entirely fleshed out, but they come down to Earth and then we kind of keep them in like a compound, you know?

Right.

It's sort of like a prawn-like alien.

Prawn-like creatures.

Right, right.

And then there's this one man who's in charge of keeping the aliens in the compound and checking on them.

And then he gets squirted, I believe squirted, we wrote in the script.

Yeah, I think that was what we stuck on.

He gets squirted.

Yeah.

I specifically remember typing squirted in the script.

By what?

This battery-like liquid.

And then he starts to transform into a prawn himself.

At the end of the movie, full prawn.

Saves the aliens, leaves a metallic rose for his wife.

Right.

Huh.

What do you think?

Fellas, it'll never work.

It'll never work.

I mean, Paul, I know you haven't even gotten around to seeing The Wire, so maybe you haven't caught this movie.

Wait, wait, wait.

What?

Caught what?

There's a movie entitled...

Is it called A Certain District?

No, it's called District 9.

They actually get specific with it.

A Certain District 9?

It's French.

It's a very ponderous film.

District 9 is the film, and you basically just said the entire plot to that movie, including the end.

Okay, well...

Wait, wait, wait.

There's a metallic rose?

There's a metallic rose, yeah, that he leaves for us.

Well, a lot of things sound similar.

Are you sure?

That's a popular ending for movies.

It's not that you're even saying an idea is similar.

You basically laid out the entire plot beat by beat, including the squirting.

Okay, well...

They wrote squirt specifically in the script?

I don't know what they wrote in the script.

All I did was see it.

I read it.

I actually was spray, so you are right.

You are different.

You do have it different.

All right, well, hold on one second.

Can you give me the log line for bridesmaids quickly?

Yeah, you'd be better at that than I would.

I think a woman who's a little down on her luck is afraid she's going to lose her best friend to another woman in the bridal party.

That sounds a lot like District 9 to me.

There is a metal rose at the end, I will tell you that.

The entire wedding party is wearing a metal rose.

Oh, great, I gave it away.

You guys don't understand movie ideas, do you, like why they're similar or why they're dissimilar?

Well, we're just...

I mean, we just dusted these things off from our garage.

This is old stuff we had.

This is old stuff.

We got new stuff, too, right?

When did that movie come out?

You should actually read them after you dust them off.

When did that movie come out?

What, District 9?

Yeah.

I would say 2009, maybe?

Well, okay, we wrote this in 2010.

That's right.

Okay.

See, I don't think you have any leg to stand on then.

They ripped us off.

Dang it.

All right.

Wait a minute, is that Ferguson?

Ferguson, did you walk in in the middle of this?

Yeah, sorry, guys.

We didn't...

If you're hearing a strange, unfamiliar voice, that's David Ferguson.

Yeah, I was feeding the meter.

Okay.

All right.

You have another pitch?

Yeah, we've got a few other ones, hopefully these knocking out of the park a little better than...

What does feeding the meter mean, anyways?

Yeah, I don't know.

It's a euphemism.

It's a euphemism for really doing it, you know?

This is an idea...

Talk right into that thing that's right in front of you.

This is an idea.

I like Mitchell's head.

This is an idea...

You're gonna feed the meter?

That furry thing by your face?

It's called Weekend at Bernays and it's...

I hear some sighing.

Good sighing or bad sighing?

No, no.

Okay, let me just...

Yeah, let me finish the pitch and then...

I don't know what a good sigh actually is.

Have you ever heard of a good sigh?

Yeah, the guy at Psy Newhouse, he runs the New York...

Good night, everyone.

Psy Coleman?

Yes.

That's a joke.

A 48-year-old guy at that town.

It's also one of our movie pitches.

I'm eight years ahead of my time.

So this movie is about a chef in a restaurant in any town USA and...

That's actually the name of the town, by the way, where you're specific.

Any town in the state is USA.

It's an alternate reality.

Just go with it, please.

It's just this chef's luck that his Bernays sauce dies and he wants to impress the rest of the restaurant and keep up appearances.

So he's walking the sauce around in the restaurant, showing it off...

Keeping up appearances.

Right.

When you say it dies, is that like when a souffle dies, meaning it falls?

This idea is basically...

Or in the alternate reality that you're in, the Bernays sauce achieves sentience of some sort.

Right.

It does for just a moment and then it dies.

And the interesting thing about this script, that we did actually flesh this one all the way out, it's...

I think the script went about 560 pages.

That is really fleshed out.

It's a long one.

That's just a treatment.

No, no.

This is the script.

That's insane for a treatment.

But I think that's a decent script.

All right.

I'm going to pass.

What do you think?

I'm a little intrigued by that one, I have to say.

Really?

What do you like about it?

I like the sentience of the Bernays sauce.

There is a lot to explore there.

We could somehow just pull that little moment out of life.

That's only the first 180 pages.

Then the sauce is dead.

But it could be like a butterfly in the diving bell type of thing where we actually see the world through.

Oh, yeah.

Interesting idea.

We'll consider.

Let's talk about this.

After the show, we'll talk about this.

Okay.

Do you want to tell them about...

Jeff, do you want to tell them about the Scott and Paul story?

Oh.

Oh, yeah.

No.

Wait a minute.

What is this?

What do you mean?

Scott and Paul story.

Well, this is one of those award...

This is one of those...

Award bait?

Yeah, yeah.

Prestige film, that.

Yes.

It's a really heartwarming story about these two guys, these comedy insiders who one day they encounter this down on their luck sketch group and they want to give them their big break.

If you can imagine that.

It's got a strong moral about doing the right thing.

And then they move into the house with them.

They help them clean out the garage.

Wait, okay.

I was kind of on board until the doing manual...

Are we killed at any point?

Wait a minute.

No, no.

No, they come out as real heroes.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

And then at the end of the movie, they're all successful and they're all holding Oscar trophies.

And they don't thank either Scott or myself.

No, no.

You guys are up there too.

Oh, okay.

We're all up there together.

Oh, okay.

Oh, good.

Holding Oscar trophies.

I thought it was kind of one of those, you know, day of the locust type thing.

We're left in the dust.

I don't know.

Well, here's the thing on that one.

Yeah.

Shot documentary style.

As though it was really happening.

That's right.

It's going to be in production.

Okay.

So it's almost improv style too.

There's no script, I would imagine, and you're just going to kind of like see what happens in the blocking of it.

Who plays Scott and Paul?

You're looking at him.

You guys?

You guys are?

That's fantastic.

Jeff and I play Scott and Mike and me play Paul.

For those of you who obviously can't see us, I'm sitting on Mitch's shoulders and Jeff's on Dave's shoulders.

I've always felt Scott and I, his personalities are so big, it needed two people to play us.

I nailed it.

Wearing a trench coat.

Well, we always thought you guys were certainly taller than us and we maybe overshot it by a whole person.

Oh boy, well.

I don't know.

Now, it sounded to me like you already did your spring cleaning, but you need your garage done.

Is that the last step in the spring cleaning?

Well, there's always spring cleaning.

I mean, we told you about this studio right here.

I mean, it's a filthy mess.

We're spring cleaning everywhere we go.

Wait, you guys will do this studio?

We'll do this studio.

That's what I said.

I think.

Yes, yes.

Of course.

That's what I meant by you guys.

It's a strange stressing of one word.

That was the inclusive way.

You guys playing us will clean the studio.

Oh, I see.

We, we.

Oh, oh.

Fair enough.

I did a subtle hand gesture there that I thought the radio might pick up.

Yeah, I don't know why you're doing the jerk off motion when you say that.

Just feeding the meter, Scott.

Feeding the meter, baby.

Scottabot, you know, we can't be young.

Should you call me Scottabot?

What?

Yeah, Scottabot.

Goodbye, hot saucerman.

Hello, Scottabot.

Anyway, Scottabot, we can't, we can't be young up-and-comers forever.

We need one of these.

No, someone has to give you their, your big break.

Yeah, we need this break.

How about you, Feeg Newton?

What do you say, Feeg Newton?

Right on.

I'm in.

Many have tried and many have failed to give you your big break.

We actually were the original cast of Freaks and Geeks, but, yeah, Paolo tested us.

Yeah, I remember.

They were, yeah.

He turned in the first cut and they said we were too freaky, too geeky.

Yeah.

That was the line.

We marched on.

And, you know, we're on to bigger and better things, too.

This isn't the only thing we've been up to.

We actually, we've met a lot of celebrities, you know, as a result of our work doing the comedy theater at UCB.

Well, you do a monthly show at UCB and you have a lot of videos and so you meet celebrities.

Meet a ton of them.

In fact, I hope you don't mind, we thought we'd invite one here to the studio.

Oh, yeah.

Well, is that okay?

This is Paul's first time on the show and I would love to have another first time guest.

Great.

So, are they in the antechamber?

Yeah, let's just get them out of the antechamber real quick.

We do keep an airlock.

That's a lot of smoke in here.

Oh, man.

Wow.

That burns.

Wow.

You want to go ahead and introduce yourself?

Hi, it's me, Britney Spears.

All right.

Oh, my God.

So it's Britney Spears.

I can't believe it.

Britney, thanks so much for joining us.

I think I speak for everyone in the room and we say it's such an honor to have you here.

It's a pleasure to be here, everyone.

I'm so happy to be here with Paul Fee and Skottabot.

Wow.

So, my new nickname spread like wildfire.

Not only that, that chamber is a soundproof booth.

So this is kind of a weird, you know, trying to be reading it on the internet.

Britney, one of your songs is in my new movie.

So thank you for being so wonderful.

I'm sure you're aware of which song that is.

Which song is it, Britney?

Yeah, that's right.

Which did the check come for?

Let's sing a quick line from that new single.

Oh, no.

No.

You can't be modest.

We've seen your work over the years.

It's probably crazy, right?

Yeah.

I think so.

It's crazy how much we love the song that you sang, which is...

It'd be crazy not to sing it right now.

Oh, all right.

I'll sing it.

I go, hit me, babe.

Perfect.

Wait a minute.

Yeah, I like that.

Surely the real Britney Spears would know the...

Yeah, this isn't...

I'm sorry.

This isn't matching up.

Yeah, Paul, does anything strike you unusual about this Britney here in the studio with us?

I think it's her hair.

Is it?

No, no.

It's fine.

It's a wig.

Hold on.

Oh, my God.

Take off that wig and hopefully we'll figure out who this is.

Oh, my God.

I like that you guys are actually miming it.

I'm still not sure...

Mime me what?

What are you talking about?

I'm still not sure who it is.

We took off the wig.

Something's still not right.

Could still be Britney.

What?

You can't recognize me by my uncanny voice.

It's me.

Gilbert Godfrey.

Oh, Gilbert Godfrey.

Yay.

Hi, Gilbert.

Hello.

How is everybody?

You got into a lot of trouble a couple of months back with that whole tsunami thing.

I know.

The whole Japan thing.

I don't regret it, but it's been hard, so I've been dressing up as different celebrities.

This week it was Britney Spears until you rotten kids blew my cover.

Well, you had me fooled.

You fooled Fig Newton, man.

Congratulations.

I'm telling you, man.

That was all...

I'm so excited about that.

The only timber lake I'm hooking up with is a pile of timber down by Lake Hollywood.

Oh, boy.

Well played, Gilbert.

Well played.

Wait, that's where you live?

You live in Lake Hollywood, I assume, then?

Yes, I live...

I actually live in Lake Hollywood.

Oh, in the lake.

Oh.

Yes, under...

There's an air pocket.

An old submarine?

There's an air pocket, and there's an old submarine, and I go between the town and the muck.

Well, I'm sorry.

That one kind of turned out to be a bust.

No offense, Gilbert, but Britney Spears is just kind of a bigger name.

We did pull some strings, though.

We were able to get Owen Wilson.

Oh, well, let's close up the empty chamber and then open it back up again.

Let's put Gilbert back in the chamber here.

Goodbye, everyone.

Thanks, Gilbert.

Bye.

All right.

That seal is airtight.

It's like a Tupperware lid.

That's how you can live in the bottom of the lake and not drown.

Yes.

He'll be fine in there for hours.

Let's open up the chamber.

Maybe we can bring out...

Chamber number two.

We have several antechambers here at the Earwool Studios.

Oh.

Something went wrong in that one.

All right.

Wow.

Hi.

Hi, Scott.

That's Owen Wilson.

Oh, Owen Wilson.

This is a lot of fun.

Wow.

Hey, congratulations on the film.

How do you know?

I know it went over...

Oh, yeah.

No, thanks so much.

That was great.

Double platinum on that film.

Uh-huh.

It was the first film to go double platinum.

I know.

I mean, it was a...

That was the weird thing about that film.

The film itself didn't do well, but the audio recording of the entire film went double platinum.

That's how I like to see a movie.

I just like to listen to it.

Paul, you're into that.

Your next film's gonna be a podcast, right?

Oh, no.

Definitely.

Right?

Because you're in it right now.

Yeah.

With a two-record set.

Well, Owen, thanks so much for coming.

Yeah, no.

Thanks for having me.

Thanks for getting me out of that chamber.

How long are you in there, man?

I was in there for about a week.

Paul, have you ever met Owen here?

Oh, no.

It's a pleasure.

Was anyone else in the chamber with you?

Oh, well, Gilbert Godfrey for a while.

Oh, I'm sorry.

That's pretty weird.

He was traveling back and forth from empty chamber one to number two?

Yeah, he was sort of upsetting all of us in there, pushing us and panting us.

All of us.

Yeah, there's more celebrities in there.

Oh, man, wow.

I think I know where this bit's going.

Where?

Oh, well, we'll see.

Oh, wait a minute.

What?

Something doesn't seem right about this.

Yeah, I don't see any suicide-like slaps.

Yeah, yeah.

Scott, no.

Come on.

Yeah, you look pretty clean.

In fact, you look a little...

That's nothing to joke about.

No, you're right.

I'm so sorry.

Who am I?

Gilbert Godfrey?

Exactly.

Wait.

Are you?

Hold on.

Here we go.

I'm taking off my mask.

Oh, boy.

It's me.

I am Gilbert Godfrey.

Oh, no.

You've been had.

Wait.

That means that the gas chamber.

Something must be wrong with that chamber.

Well, you know, the only bottle rocket I have is...

Let me out.

That would make you the Gilbot.

Yes.

Hey, Gilbot.

Yeah.

I locked Ackerman in the auto chamber.

Well, that wasn't very nice.

I'm making you breathe in there.

Get me out of here, Gilbot.

Hold on.

I'm going to open this up and get Scott back in here.

Oh.

There we go.

Well, Scott, when you last left us...

What happened?

Well, it turns out that Gilbert Godfrey had been impersonating you since the beginning of the show.

Since the beginning of the show?

Yeah.

Hey, Paul.

Hey, Scott.

Where were you?

Nice to meet you.

Were you feeding the meter?

Nice to meet you.

Should we talk about bridesmaids?

Yeah.

Oh, that's great.

I covered it.

Don't worry.

Well, you know, what else?

Owen Wilson actually showed up, but we were just saying there is something a little weird about Owen here.

Well, I mean, like Gilbert said, I don't have the...

Yeah.

You're a little bit pudgier, too.

You're a little bit pudgier.

Yeah.

Hold on a second.

That's a wig.

Oh, my God.

Oh, no.

That's a long, long surfer wig.

Oh, my God.

It's Luke Wilson.

Oh, hey, guys.

Oh, the lesser of the two Wilsons.

Oh, jeez.

There's only one thing worse than Gilbert Gottfried appearing in the studio, and that's getting Luke Wilson in their own Wilson bait and switch.

Hey, Luke, how are those Verizon commercials treating you?

They're not going so great anymore.

Not really the springboard back into cinema you thought it would be?

No, I thought I would be back as an A-list.

You know what's weird is all of a sudden your suicide scars from the Royal Tenenbaums have appeared.

They let Wes let me keep those.

Okay, good.

You hate to let a good makeup job go to waste.

Well, all they do is throw them out, and I mean, I said, Wes, if we're just going to throw them out, I'll take those home.

That was, yeah, I was going to, if the movie career didn't take off like it hasn't, I'm going to...

You're going to sell those?

You're going to sell them like the tips of Spock's ears.

Yeah.

Absolutely.

Just show them to the Tenenbaums conventions.

Come to find out there is no such thing as a Tenenbaums convention.

I didn't know that at the time.

Well, Luke, it's always a pleasure to see you.

You've been on the show many times, so it's great to see you, but any other celebrities you mentioned?

I think we had one more.

One more?

Let's see if we can get them out here.

Antichamber three.

Antichamber three opened.

Oh my God.

That's a bit hot.

Atmosphere has been compromised.

Oh my God.

Self-destructed.

Oh my God, oh my God.

Self-destruct initiated.

Oh my God.

Folks, I'm so sorry.

In five.

I thought we were going to bring out Frank Sinatra.

Hours.

Oh, hours.

Oh, God.

Thank God.

There's plenty of time.

We've got plenty of time.

We can probably finish up this podcast and then take off, right?

Can we tell the rest of the building?

Nah.

Oh my God, but it's Frank Sinatra.

We're at the end of a workday.

No one's here at night.

Wait, there's not a cleating stand?

Nah.

Well, we don't care about that.

Oh.

All right.

Who is this?

Paul, can you see who this is?

It's so foggy in here.

Emerging from the haze.

Too much smoke.

Oh, blue eyes.

Oh, look at that.

Look at his blue eyes.

Hey, it's me.

Old blue eyes.

Wait a minute.

Wow.

Frank Sinatra.

It is Frank Sinatra.

It's me, Frank Sinatra.

How is everyone doing?

We're all great.

Oh man, it's great coming back from Vegas to see all of you.

And the dead.

Oh, that too.

Yeah, it's even more impressive.

Yeah, how long have you been in that chamber, Frank?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

First thing to go when you're dead.

Is the mind.

The improv skills.

The last thing he remembers is going to the bathroom at Musso and Frank's, ended up in a weird chamber.

Right after his Improv 101 class got canceled.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, it's cool to have you.

I'm sorry.

It's me, Gilbert Cardinal.

Yeah, we knew.

We figured.

The only rat pack I'm a leader of is an actual pack of rats.

The one from Ratatouille?

Yeah.

Mike Scott.

You know.

All right.

Well.

All right, guys.

Well, it's, you know, it's great to see you all, the birthday boys and Gilbert Gottfried and Luke Wilson.

We're all here.

And Paul Vig is here.

Why don't we take a break?

We'll go to another song when we come back.

We'll have more Paul Vig, more birthday boys coming up right after this.

Yeah.

Hi, I'm John Warris and this is The Creep.

When you're out at a club and you see a fly girl, do the creep and do the creep.

And if you want to make friends at the ATM, do the creep and do the creep.

Where we got a new dance, soak it up on your feet.

It's real easy to do and it's called The Creep.

Let your hands flop around like a marionette.

Pop your knees up and down.

Shake your chick in your neck.

Now pull your waistband up like you expecting a flood.

And stick your head down flat like it was covered in mud.

Trim up your pencil mustache and pop them peepers.

Hold this in your speakers.

You a certified creeper.

When you see a country beach laying out at the beach, do the creep and do the creep.

And when a fine PYT walks in front of your tree, do the creep and do the creep.

I was six years old when I started creepin'.

My parents took it to their room and I started peepin'.

You can't imagine that surprise when they lifted their heads.

And saw my little ass creepin' at the foot of the bed.

And they knew I was a creep since the day I was born.

Gave hoppin' out my mama like some catacombs.

Yeah, the doctor cut my head and he started freakin'.

Cause I came up clean and I came up creepin'.

When I was a girl I creeped in the boys locker room.

High deep inside it was my little creep stalker room.

As they dismoved I was ogling and ogling.

Little did they know that for me they were modeling and I would laugh.

And they would dance.

So pop, pop your peepers in to trick out your sneakers.

Don't sleep, come on get your creep on with me.

And you're gonna get your sweatin' off the bride at her wedding.

Do the creep and do the creep.

Or when you sneak into a wake and you see a BK.

Do the creep and do the creep.

When the judge is a hottie and you can't control your body.

Do the creep and do the creep.

So get your knees flexin' and your arms T-rexin' and creep.

Do the creep.

And don't forget to smile.

Alright, we're back.

And I am of course Scottabot.

And we're here with Paul Feig from Bridesmaids coming out this Friday.

Everyone has to go see that of course.

It is mandatory if you are a comedy fan.

Yes, do your duty.

So funny.

And please go out there and support movies like this.

Because we need good funny comedy movies out there.

How often does Tim Heidecker get to play a groom?

And not say anything.

And dance to a very girly band.

Absolutely. I was laughing at just his pure reaction shots.

Which is the entirety of his performance.

He's fantastic.

Had him on the show a couple of weeks ago.

We talked about that of course.

And we have the birthday boys here right in front of me.

Or at least four of them.

Hello out there.

Now you were saying on the break we were listening to music.

And that reminded you that music existed.

Oh yeah.

I hadn't thought about music until we just heard that song.

And you had something that you wanted to say about music?

Paul, are you a fan of music?

Are you a fan of this guy talking right outside the window?

If he did music that would be my favorite album ever.

Yeah, with Tim Heidecker and Neil Hamburger.

There's a lot of people out in the alley foraging through the dumpsters.

Looking for comedy gold.

I like to think of that as the audience.

So let's just play to them.

As we were cleaning out our garage we found some of our old recordings.

When you say old recordings, what do you mean?

Do you have new recordings?

We were reminded, like you said, what music was.

But yeah, we were in a band.

We all studied music theory and were professional musicians for some time.

What were you guys called? Was it the Birthday Boys as well?

Or Birthday Boys the band?

The Birthday Boys as well.

Yeah, for years we toured.

And actually, you know, we were...

We're going to pitch this out and I hope it doesn't offend you.

I hope it sticks.

We know that you just re-did your...

You brought your percussionist in.

Oh, and put those kettle drums away.

Come on, She-Lee.

Back in the antechamber.

Yeah, we heard you re-recorded your theme song.

The new theme song. Everyone loves it.

Yeah, Reggie Watts did the new theme song for us.

And we love Reggie. We know him from the music industry.

Huge fans.

But we just thought, you know, maybe you could use something a little different.

Something entirely new and original.

Now, this has only been the new theme song for a week now.

But it's great.

It's great, but it needs to be changed.

You gotta feed the meter.

Let's take it on an entirely different meaning, I believe, now.

You know how you know when somebody's been feeding the meter?

There's little bits of Kleenex stuck on the tips of their fingers.

And the suicide scars.

Oh, I'll take those.

Oh, Mr. Wilson's back.

Wilson! Mr. Wilson!

Do you have a neighbor named Dennis, a cute little adorable boy?

Yeah, I do.

Who bothers you?

He's a pain in my...

I'm not gonna say...

Hey, by the way, can we swear here?

Oh yeah, please do.

Okay, I don't want to, but...

Yeah, he's a pain.

Okay, great.

Alright, so you have an idea for a new theme song.

Yeah, just something completely different.

A whole new take.

A fresh start.

Guys, should we just...

We're rusty, but we can try to hit it.

Ready?

Okay.

Can I do this a cappella, or do you need anything from me?

Well, do you have a backing track?

I mean, if you have a backing track, then yeah.

I don't know...

If you somehow got into the air chamber and it turned into a time machine, and you went back and heard our song and recorded it, then please, by all means, play it.

But otherwise, yeah, I guess we're singing it a cappella.

I think those people in the alley have a backing track.

A song to the sounds of hobos shouting.

Which was my old band, actually, Hobo Shouting.

Hobo Shouting and the Big Newtons.

Very cool.

Oh, they were great.

Alright, here we go.

One, two, three, four.

Comedy, death ray.

Hold on, hold on, hold on.

Guys, guys, that's the old theme song.

That's the one we got rid of a week ago.

You guys are basically just singing the old theme song, and not as well.

Reggie Watts has one man and recorded it by himself.

You're four, and it sounds horrible.

Did he have a four track?

How'd you do that?

Wait, is that all you're asking?

You want to know how he did it?

That's the only reason this bit is happening?

You want to know his recording process?

We are new to the idea of music.

Wait a minute, what happened to your old band?

The Birthday Boys as well?

Oh yeah, that's right.

I just forgot.

Anyways, how did he do it?

Honestly.

Alright, we'll talk about that off air.

At length, too.

Does it get pretty gruesome?

Yeah.

Too graphic.

Alright, guys.

Well, it was worth a shot.

It certainly was.

I always appreciate that.

While we listen to the melodious sounds of an argument, I'm assuming is over drugs.

If anyone, by the way, if you ever watch those CSI type shows, you ever direct one of those, Paul?

Or you ever been on one of those?

I think you're over four with that question.

Exactly.

Keep going, Scott.

He does have an IMDB page.

Alright.

You have an IMDB page?

Yes.

Alright, got one right.

You know how people can isolate sounds in recordings and pick it out of the air and figure out exactly what people were saying?

If anyone can find out what this argument is about that we're hearing, I would love to know what people are arguing about right outside our window.

A lot of thumping and definitely a dumpster is involved.

Sheila Escovedo is out there involved in this.

Okay, so I believe that we now are time for one of our features on the show, if you don't mind.

It's time for a little something that we call Would You Rather.

Uh oh.

Oh, the king's here.

Paul, you're not supposed to talk to her.

I'm going to have to dock you points.

Alright, it's time to play Would You Rather.

Oh, fantastic.

Unlike your theme song, that does not need re-recording, man.

I like how you have more patience for that theme song than you have for any of us.

That is a weird quirk of my personality.

Here's a little break for you.

Alright, we all know how this is played.

We take Would You Rather scenarios from our Twitter account, which by the way has changed its name.

CBBWYR, Comedy Bang Bang Would You Rather.

All of your old submissions are still in there.

No need to resubmit them.

Paul, you're big on Twitter.

You have several million followers, right?

A little over a million, but yeah.

So one million.

Yeah.

When I say several, I mean.

And one.

But how did you get so many followers?

Is that just by being great at it?

I have no idea.

I think I just got in early when people weren't discriminating.

And so they're just kind of like, hey, look, there's a guy.

Very funny stuff.

We had a great one today.

I don't want to give away when we're recording this, but we're recording this in 2010.

Yes, exactly.

We always do it a year early.

Yeah.

I can't wait to get into production on it.

What if it just changes radically from the log line you gave?

Those are all lucky guesses.

It doesn't even start with the people you're talking about anymore.

All right.

So they're sent to us at our Twitter, at CDRWYR.

And I will read one of these scenarios.

Oh, God.

What's going on now?

Is somebody strangling a parrot?

Engineer Doug, take a look.

No, don't go out there.

Just take a look.

Take a look.

What do you got?

Give us a report.

Engineer Doug is going to go out.

He's taking a look out the window.

My God, he's been pulled out the window.

Into the handy chamber.

Oh, no.

Doug's gone.

Welcome.

Who's he there with?

I knew it.

Yay.

Got to be careful with that door.

Remember, shut that door behind you, letting Gilbert.

What if Gilbert's having the fight out in the alley?

Yeah.

Oh, no.

He'll be okay.

All right.

I hope they're fighting next to my car.

All right.

So we will read the scenario.

I will then open the floor for questions.

You can ask me any question about either of the scenarios you like in order to narrow down your choice.

At a certain point, I will close the floor for questions, and then you will vote, and I will tally up the points, and we will see who is the winner.

You know, sometimes we do this on when we play the other game, but I'd like you guys to pick who you're playing for, okay?

Because as a celebrity, Paul, it's a lot like when people play Celebrity Jeopardy.

It would be unseemly to keep the money that you win.

True, true.

So it's better if you play for a charity or something like that.

So who would you like to play?

I'd like to play for my wife.

Really?

Yes.

Now, do you share joint accounts there?

No, we'll have two separate accounts.

So technically, we won't be going to them.

Okay, great.

All right.

And what is your wife's name?

Lori.

Lori...

Vig.

Oh, okay.

Worked out well.

And the birthday boys, collectively, who will you be playing for?

We'll be playing to get Doug back, I guess.

Okay.

So playing for engineer Doug.

All right, so this is the chattiest show we've ever had.

Doug, you're all right to go out there?

Okay.

There's a Paul Simon concert later tonight.

It was across the street.

I'm not lying.

Really?

Oh, maybe fans are showing up.

It could be fans are showing up.

Maybe it's Garfunkel himself.

Hey, let me in.

Oh, good luck.

Oh, and he was never seen again.

All right, so let's go.

This is sent to us by Rizzo34, whose real name is Riz.

His screen name's longer now you've outdated his name.

Rizzo34 asks, would you rather be a ghost on a cruise ship?

Be a ghost on a cruise ship or the world's richest holocaust denier?

Would you rather be a ghost on a cruise ship or the world's richest holocaust denier?

I am now opening the floor for questions.

Birthday boys, are you gonna be playing as a team or as individuals all trying to achieve the same goal?

We can all achieve the same goal.

But as individuals or as a team?

Team.

Oh, team.

Okay, team.

So you'll need to ask questions as a team then.

You can't confer, like Wheel of Fortune, you know, you can't just blurt out questions.

Oh, okay.

We could all ask it once and the same question will come out.

Yeah, that would be preferable.

Okay.

Yeah, here we go.

And one, two, three.

Do you find him holocaust denier?

You know what, actually, I have a real question.

Okay.

Does everyone know that we are holocaust deniers?

Is that public knowledge?

Great question, birthday boys.

Yes, as a matter of fact, that's why you're so rich.

When everyone finds out how you are the only person who knows the truth, they all donate to you.

You have a little Kickstarter account and that's why you're so rich.

You're the world's richest man because of that.

So that's actually a great thing.

Now...

Paul Feig.

The floor recognizes Paul Feig.

Would I be denying the existence of the mini-series holocaust or the actual holocaust?

And what was the mini-series?

Great question.

Refreshed my memory?

Great question.

It was an hour long event from the 70s.

From the 70s?

Yes.

And what network would that have been on?

Central Broadcasting System?

I do not remember.

I believe it was...

I watched it on my old Philco.

I'm going to take a step at a turn and ask you on Scott's behalf, did you have any involvement with the making of that picture?

Did that come after Mad Men?

Yes.

No.

I wish I had.

You are denying the existence of the actual holocaust, but you are a big fan of that movie.

Because you wish it had happened.

Because I look at it as a comedy or...

You look at it as a sci-fi where you wish the holocaust had...

You wish it had happened because it seemed so cool, but you deny that it ever did.

Oh, so it's a good story, but it didn't really happen.

Yeah, exactly.

Oh, okay.

Big fan.

Big fan of the story.

I would probably talk like that too.

Big fan.

Hey, big fan of the story.

Hey, I'm back everyone.

Oh my God, Gilbert.

Hey, that tsunami thing.

Oh my God.

Don't say...

He puts Scott's head back on.

I put my head back on.

Hey, I'm back.

There's a great voice filter in that mask.

It really works effectively.

It's like the scream.

It's a voice filter.

That's right.

Or like Darth Vader.

It's kind of great.

All right, questions from...

I got one.

All right, Mike Mitchell from the Birthday Boys.

As a ghost on the cruise ship, can you partake, can you enjoy the activities on the cruise ship?

Is he celebrated by the community on that ship?

Great question.

Or just haunted.

Oh, okay.

And that's what you get when you have a sketch on SOM on the show.

Great question.

The ghost on the cruise ship, we haven't talked about this scenario yet.

You are only able to...

You're able to go through all of the activities, meaning shuffleboard, everything on the Lido deck, but the all-you-can-eat buffets, you are only allowed to go through once.

Because they have a strict anti-ghost policy where...

Because ghosts are transparent and everything passes through them, the food just passes right through on the ground and they're tired of wasting food.

Hold on a second.

So they are only allowed to go through once and then they clean up the floor where the ghosts were.

But still once, they're allowed to go through.

They are allowed once, yeah.

Because who knows?

A ghost may return to solid form at some point and they don't want to...

Would there be ghost boos on the ship?

Great question, yes.

Anytime anyone kills a 12-pack, then yeah.

Oh, so every time a drink is consumed, it becomes a ghost drink.

Well, you got to kill a drink.

Yeah.

Anytime a frat boy is on the ship.

Oh, you just really got to slam it down.

Yeah, yeah.

Exactly.

So if somebody was sipping nicely a martini.

Yeah, no, no, no.

A beer bomb.

That changes everything.

A shotgun.

Yeah, definitely.

So I'd just be drinking a lot of Jaeger and tequila.

Exactly.

Okay.

Can ghosts get hangovers then?

Is that...

Yeah, can you get copies of the DVD?

Yeah, definitely.

They're all here at the studio, by the way, if anyone needs any, they're right next to the wire.

Yeah, that's the...

A big problem with the ghosts is, and a lot of people don't know this about ghosts, is they are hang...

They're hangovers personified.

That's why they exist, is they're not actual real people who have been alive and who are now dead.

They're actually the hangovers of people who are living.

A lot of people don't know that.

So are they in pain?

Your question made me more confused.

It's not intended to do that.

It's intended to clear things up and make your choice a little more easy.

I was thinking of the hangover movie too, I guess, part of that.

Oh, okay.

But is it...

So they always feel pain?

Is that what you're saying?

Wait, what are you saying?

The ghosts?

Wait, who are...

That's not Mike.

Oh no.

Oh, he's got a wig.

Oh no, it's a wig.

I can't believe we've been hoodwinked again.

Hold on.

Who is this?

It's me.

Oh, jeez.

Oh, the talk about ghosts.

I made fun of those Japanese people, now I'm starting to feel bad about it.

Wow.

Now you're starting to feel...

Gilbert's feeling remorse.

Finally.

Wow.

How does it feel?

It feels terrible.

All right, any other questions here on either scenario?

The cruise.

Would it be like a swing...

The cruise on the cruise?

No, the cruise.

Would it be like a swinger's cruise or would it be like a Disney cruise, or is it like a Star Trek cruise?

It's people who dress like they are in swinger's cruise.

Oh, really?

Okay.

So my ex-girlfriend is very happy.

Oh, so it's like a fan kind of cruise.

Yeah, exactly.

So you're in swingers, you dress like you're in swingers, you talk about swingers.

It's not like one of those tea party cruises where the game culture shows up and those kind of cruises.

No, no, no, no, no.

It's pretty much just Vince Vaughn is there, Owen Wilson is there as a friend to Vince Vaughn from The Wedding Crashers, he's there to support.

That's nice.

If we get him out of the box, he'd be...

Yeah, I know.

If he ever gets out of there...

Hey.

Oh, hey, hey, hey.

Get back in there.

Let's open her up.

Hi, I heard my name.

I figured I'd come by and see what you're talking about.

Can you give us any kind of information on this cruise?

Yeah, well, I mean, the floor is a mess because a lot of ghosts are just letting the food fall all over the place.

I fell overboard.

Really?

What happened?

Yeah.

I slipped on a pie.

Wait a minute.

You're a ghost right now.

Yeah, all right.

Well...

We didn't know that you were not alive anymore, Owen Wilson.

Yeah.

Well, you got your wish.

Amazing.

Are you able to eat at all?

Well, like you said, I can attempt it once a day.

And then it falls all over the floor.

And I said, well, that's a bad idea.

I'm not gonna do that again.

The floors on this cruise just sound like a mess.

I mean, it's not just the ghosts, from what I understand.

It's like the swingers fans on the cruise are actually like...

Well, they get their food, and they dance around, and it goes everywhere.

Yeah.

That's actually...

That fight you were hearing was...

I was yelling at Owen for making a mess of my submarine floor.

We gotta stop doing the show in a duck.

Yeah.

You guys all need a little bit of spring cleaning.

Huh?

Oh, yeah.

Back to that.

Visit from that sub-inspector, you're screwed.

All right.

Any other questions before we close?

I have one more question.

One more question.

Are there other ghosts on the ship?

Great question.

Yes.

Basically what happened with the swingers cruise is there's only about three people who still remember that movie.

So they had to populate the cruise with ghosts.

Oh, so it's...

Oh.

Yeah.

So they're using ghost money.

Nice.

Yeah.

Both metaphorically and literally.

Did they screen ghost rider?

Yeah.

Of course.

Oh, excellent.

Or ghost...

And the ghost rider.

The ghost rider and rider.

Oh, that's good.

Oh, that's nice.

And the ghost.

Oh, there we go.

Yeah, of course.

This is getting better.

And swingers.

Just those four movies on a loop.

There you go.

And then the buffets and the shuffleboard.

Yes.

All right.

We are closing up the floor for questions, and now we are going to have to vote.

Let me remind everyone what the question is.

Would you rather be a ghost on a cruise ship or the world's richest Holocaust denier?

Let me go to Paul Feig first.

How do you like to vote?

Well, knowing that it's going to be filled with ghosts, I think I'm going to go with the ghost.

Really?

Because I could...

All the free ghost booze I could drink.

Right.

I can enjoy college sort of drinks.

Always been fascinated by ghosts.

Yes, exactly.

I'm sure.

Yes.

Were you scared by ghosts as a child?

No, by the movie ghost.

Oh, really?

Yes, exactly.

You saw that as a child?

Yes, I did.

I did.

I have a time machine.

Right.

Scared by the fact that Patrick Swayze would meet his untimely demise?

Yes, that scared me.

In the movie.

Yes.

Whoopi's performance just scared me.

Just in general.

In general.

The fact that she would be able to host the Oscars twice.

Yes.

Exactly.

I found that very scary.

Yeah.

All right.

Birthday boys, are you voting collectively?

Sure.

I was going to say, how about...

I think, yeah, we'll go with the Holocaust denier.

I don't remember the other part of that one, but Holocaust denier was enough.

World's richest is, I think.

Oh, whatever.

I was like, hey, yeah, okay, cool.

Okay, and why...

So you just wanted to go on a Holocaust denier?

Yeah.

You just wanted to vote just on that?

Yeah.

Forgetting that it would be the richest name.

I didn't mean to speak for everyone.

No, I was with you on that one.

Okay, cool.

Sometimes we have to pick up on each other's thoughts.

All right.

Well...

Wait, can I interject?

I want to save that.

Yes, please do.

World's richest Holocaust survivor, but how rich is the world...

How like the richest Holocaust survivor right now?

How much money does he have?

Well, for me...

Is he really rich?

I was caught up on Holocaust denier, which is why I chose it, but...

Oh, yeah, I didn't mean...

I said it wrong.

But yeah, no, I...

No, Paul.

That's an interesting little side universe.

But Paul, no, I'm right there with you, and...

That is a question, by the way, that you guys did not ask about.

The world's richest Holocaust survivor is in a constant battle, much like Highlander, with the world's richest Holocaust denier.

Oh, that's fantastic.

They fight each other all the time.

If they ever get close to each other and touch each other, the world explodes.

Does Nicolas Cage play one of them?

Oh, yeah.

He's the next time off from playing the ghost ride-ter.

And...

Excellent.

Yeah.

Does the world's richest Holocaust denier have enough money to make the Holocaust not happen?

Mike, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to dock you points.

You did not ask that.

You can ask questions after.

Yeah.

We didn't prefer it before.

I'm afraid you've even already voted.

And I'm sorry, you guys lose that round.

Paul, you win that round.

Oh, sweet.

So you get one point.

Yes.

So, this next question is worth 900,786 points.

That's hardly six.

What's the point?

We need those points.

Anyone can win here.

If we get this, we win Scott a buck.

Yeah, anyone can win at this point.

All right.

So, Patrick J. Coyne, at Patrick J. Coyne, whose real name is Patrick Coyne, not sure why I didn't put the J in his real name, he asks, would you rather tell Dracula to shut up or give the Wolfman dating advice?

Would you rather tell Dracula to shut up or give the Wolfman dating advice?

I'm opening the floor for questions.

What do you got, gentlemen and ladies?

Are there repercussions to telling Dracula to shut up or will he do it and then it's done?

Any transactions.

Great question.

Is it?

Really?

That's a good one.

Scott meant to say it's a question.

Yeah, it is a question.

There are several repercussions to Dracula, you telling him to shut up, yes.

Enough said.

I want to ask that follow-up question so bad, but I won't.

Roll down.

Go ahead.

We know how to play the game.

Rules of the game.

I'll give you my turn.

I want to hear it.

Policy.

Thank you very much, Paul.

I'm sitting at one point right now.

Now, are you Owen Wilson or are you Mike Hanford?

Yeah.

Which one are you?

It's floating.

The lines are becoming blurred.

Did you get in the chamber with Owen Wilson and then... Yeah, take on some of his qualities.

I'm a morbid version of that handsome devil.

Handsome devil.

Yes, your follow-up question.

Yeah, the follow-up question is what are the repercussions?

I mean, is it a violent attack from Dracula?

If you... Yes, it is a violent attack of kisses because he is so appreciative that someone finally had the balls to do it.

Thousands of years, he's been sitting there in old Transylvania just going to sleep in his coffin and everyone says, yes, sir, Mr. Dracula, sure, can I eat some flies around you, Mr. Dracula, and no one has the balls to tell him to shut the fuck up.

You finally do and he bears his teeth and it's actually kind of scary.

It's like in a movie where it's like that trick thing where you think something's going to happen but then he just goes, I love you, I love you for telling me that.

That's so sweet.

Yeah, so you are boyfriends with Dracula after this.

Wow.

Now I've got so many more followers.

That's a bonus.

Well, unfortunately, it's Paul's turn.

Exactly.

Thanks a lot for that set up.

Unfortunately, we turn now.

Here comes Fig.

What is Dracula saying that would facilitate his having to be told shut up?

Would it be something shut up worthy or would I be being a dick by kind of like he's telling something really interesting and I'm like shut up, Dracula, and he's like shut up, Fig, let him talk.

Here's the problem.

Great question.

You own a winery.

You own a very large winery in a wine country in central California and he is always going on and on about I don't drink wine and he's always putting that pregnant pause before it and you're like, dude, this is my living, okay, this is what I do, okay, that's like me going around to you going, well, I don't think it's really cool of you to go and kill people and suck their blood.

It's like rude, Dracula.

Is he doing the hacky I don't drink Merlot sideways joke too and thinking he's clever?

Oh yeah.

All the time.

He's a big fan of sideways.

So he's constantly quoting and he's constantly quoting Austin Powers.

I'm really wanting to tell them to shut up right now.

Yeah.

Austin Powers and Borat and sideways, the three, and Swingers and Ghost Rider- And Bud Light commercials.

And Ghost Writer and of course the movie Ghost.

So he's big into those eight movies and Bud Light commercials and you're just like, shut the fuck up one day.

Exactly.

He's like, what's up?

You're like, oh, jeez.

Really?

It's been 10 years.

I mean, still funny.

For him, I guess it's like yesterday.

He's like, what?

What?

I just heard that.

What's funny?

No, it was 10 years ago.

What are these years?

I sleep in a box.

What do you want from me?

Oh no.

Here I am.

I say one thing about Japan.

They put me in this box.

Hold on, hold on, hold on.

Wait, I'm going to tell Dracula to shut up.

My head came off for a second there.

It's the Owen Wilson, Mike Hanford effect we've seen.

Everyone's lit up today.

Oh my gosh.

Does that answer your question, Paul?

Yes.

Okay, great.

Birthday boys?

Oh, right.

I think we should ask a Wolfman question.

Yeah, I think so too.

Yeah, we haven't asked anything about the Wolfman scenario.

That was, that was he- Dating advice.

Dating advice.

Okay, I got it.

I got it.

Okay, nobody's fighting for it.

You just go ahead and say it.

I'm holding him back from Mike Hanford.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Everyone.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Shut the fuck up.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What if?

Let me think about this while I say whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

All right.

What do you got?

Okay.

Now, if you're giving, so you give dating advice to Wolf, the Wolfman.

Yep.

That's a restating question.

You're just stalling at this point.

What do you got?

Say it right now, immediately.

So if you give, so when... without stuttering, spit out your goddamn question.

All right.

So you give the advice to the Wolfman.

Have you got another restatement of the question?

Yeah.

God damn it.

Say this question.

You're wasting Paul Feig's time.

We're losing point.

Would Wolfman attack you at all, or is he your buddy?

Jesus Christ.

All right.

Great question.

That is a good question.

Really?

Most basic question.

He attacks you with kisses.

Oh, wait a minute.

He gives you advice about how to date you.

It's like one of those things where you've got a friend who's in love with you, but they're afraid to say that they're in love with you, and afraid to say they're a werewolf.

You don't know that he's a werewolf, by the way.

So either way, you're ending either one of these scenarios in a relationship, is that correct?

No.

No, you are not in a relationship with a werewolf.

It is unwanted.

Oh.

That one's unwanted.

Okay.

It's always wanted in our case.

I know what you're trying to say, but that just went right through our ears.

Why is it unwanted with the wolf man when Dracula seems more annoying?

You just don't like hairy dudes.

It's the scratchy kisses.

Scratchy kisses.

Beard burn.

All right.

Any other questions about either of these scenarios?

I've got...

Paul Fiegg.

The floor recognizes it.

The wolf man.

Is it the actual wolf man, or is it the wolf man, a guy who sells wolf paraphernalia and enjoys wolves?

It's the disc jockey.

The wolf man.

Oh.

The wolf man jag.

Yeah, of course.

I like how he put the, the in front of his name.

Yeah, I thought that that was...

I'm the wolf man jag.

Yeah.

That's right.

Yeah, excellent.

It goes without saying.

I feel like there's an easy answer to this one.

Me too.

Well, don't answer yet, but otherwise, you know what?

I am going to have to dock you, by the way, points for stuttering so much.

Wait a minute.

You're down to... I'm docking you down to you can only win two points if you win this one.

That's just how he talks.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

So you're only able to win two points.

Meanwhile, Paul, you can still win the 978,000.

Thank goodness.

Yeah, but you guys can only win... Now, you can still win the game, because that'll beat his one.

Oh, there's another round?

But I'm afraid I'm docking you those points.

Wait, how many?

There's not more rounds?

Many more rounds?

No, this'll be it.

This is the final round.

Yeah.

So this is it.

So the score is either going to be two to one, or it's going to be 978,500 plus one.

So what you're telling us is there's only two Twitter followers at the bottom.

No, I can go on all day.

I know, exactly.

The listener... I may try the listener's patience.

All right, any other questions here before we close up the antechamber, and then the vault?

Oh, go ahead.

Yeah, go ahead, Mike.

I want to either...

You said, uh.

Yeah, I didn't have a question.

I was leaning forward to hear you.

Yeah, go ahead.

You said, uh.

Hit us with it.

What do you got?

Um...

Damn it.

God damn it.

There go the points.

Say your question right now.

Useable points.

All right, so with the Wolfman, you give him dating advice, correct?

Yes, you say that every time.

You always present your answers as an if state.

All right, I'm knocking you down.

You're at one and a half points.

You can win.

You can still win, though.

You can still win.

Well, either of them turn you... Well, I guess...

Into what?

Well, I guess the Wolfman radio DJ can turn you into...

No, he's a vampire.

Yes, he can turn you into a DJ.

The Wolfman Jack is a vampire.

We all know that.

Oh.

So, yeah, they both turn you into a vampire at the end of this scenario.

Yeah.

Okay.

All right.

Good question.

Not great.

I'm going to dock you another quarter point.

So you're down to one and a quarter points available to you, the birthday boys.

You can still win, though.

Screw up again so I can be guaranteed a win.

No problem.

All right, just for that, I'm going to dock you another eighth of a point, so you're...

What I tell you.

You're one and an eighth.

A lot of shaving going on here.

All right.

You can still win, though.

This is just like last year's Super Bowl.

All right.

Any other questions before I lock up the antechamber?

Yeah.

Why aren't you going to shave us for that Super Bowl con?

Real smartass.

Here you go.

One and one-sixteen.

You can still win, though.

All right.

So here we go.

Let's close up the antechamber if I can have the ceremonial closing of the antechamber please.

All right.

Nice close.

Yeah.

Gilbert did not make it.

He's back in the antechamber.

I'm sure there's no reason that he would ever come back here.

Never come to that.

Never.

All right.

So we've closed up the floor for questions.

I'm going to turn to the birthday boys.

How do you like to vote?

Well, I'll let you guys speak first this time if you'd like.

Well, I'm thinking we're going to go with the vampire scenario.

Okay.

Vampire scenario.

And which one?

Dracula.

I'm sorry.

Dracula.

Okay.

I'm going to have to dock you another little bit.

So you're down to one in one thirty-second.

Okay.

A little bit is way too general of a phrasing of that, I was going to say.

You're going to have to get a little more specific.

My calculator doesn't have a little bit, but.

One in one sixty-fourth.

There you go.

Sorry, guys.

Cool.

All the way down.

Should we just stop with any sort of comment now?

Yeah.

Probably.

But tell us why you vote for the Dracula.

It seemed like a better scenario.

There wasn't as much to lose.

You're just saying from a story perspective, like a screenwriter perspective, it just sounded like a more interesting scenario?

Yeah.

To me.

Okay.

You end up in a relationship as well.

Yeah.

You're not turned into a vampire in both scenarios, but at least in that one you're in a relationship.

Plus, you were helping out.

An abusive relationship.

You guys didn't ask about the nature of it, but.

We weren't helping out.

It was a punch.

What?

The other one was the helping out.

You guys never asked the question about the tenor of the relationship, but yeah, it's an abusive one.

So, Paula, how do you like to live?

Kind of like our relationship with you, Scott.

I'm a fairly positive person, so I think rather than tear down Dracula, I'd rather help build up Wolfman with some.

Wolfman Jack.

Giving him dating advice.

He seems like, per chance, a lonely man.

And at the end of it, he's still lonely, because you rebuff his advances, and.

Yeah, that's true, but at least he's tasted love.

And at least, you know, it's all out on the table, you know, he has time to heal now instead of nursing this crush.

That is true.

He'll always have, we'll always have Paris.

All right, guys, well, let me tally up the votes here, and the winner.

Please, please, please.

Oh, God.

With.

I hope it's Fig.

One and one sixty-fourth point is the birthday boy.

No.

No way.

This is bullshit.

What'd I tell you?

Just like the Super Bowl.

And we got Doug Beck.

Don't tell me any more about that Super Bowl.

I have a T-vote.

Plus, it's next year.

It's 2011.

I'm afraid I have to bring my homeless minions in here now.

Fellas.

Oh, no, attack.

Oh, no.

They've been getting ready all hour.

They're all Gilbert Gottfrieds.

All right, congratulations to the birthday boys.

That is, of course, how we play.

Would you rather.

Shut up, everyone.

I know, I get yelled at.

Oh, I'm going to have to dock you.

What?

I'm going to lose again.

One sixty-fourth of a point.

I'm going to sing it.

What, I'm going to lose again?

One sixty-fourth of a point.
