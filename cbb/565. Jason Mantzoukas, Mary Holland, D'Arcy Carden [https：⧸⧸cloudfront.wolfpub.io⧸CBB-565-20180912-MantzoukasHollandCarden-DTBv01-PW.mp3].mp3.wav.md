♪♪♪ Hey, can you please nong that somewhere else, man? Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang!

Oh, thank you to Colfax McLiverneck for that very applicable catchphrase submission today, because we have the Hey Nong Man himself coming up on the show.

My name is Scott Aukerman, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week, and he is back.

He has not been on the show for a couple of months, and wondering what's been going on with him.

Coming up a little later, before we get to him, the Nong Man, we have an amateur chef will be here, and we have a surprise, my producer has a surprise person from my past.

That's exciting. Alright, so we'll find out who that is a little later in the show, but here's a surprise person from my present.

Do you think it's your imaginary friend? From your past?

What's this now?

Like an imaginary friend? Do you think this is going to be like a Drop Dead Fred scenario?

A DDF?

Yup. A DDFS.

I hope not.

By the way, I went to a DDFS the other day thinking he was a dentist, it was not.

Oh really?

Yeah, it was a Drop Dead Fred scenario.

You walked into an office and it was a Drop Dead Fred scenario?

It was. It was very uncomfortable.

Oh god.

Please welcome him, he is the co-host of I Was There Too.

No, what is the show that you do?

Which show?

The podcast that you do on the...

I do this podcast often, Comedy Bang Bang.

Not often enough, as far as I'm concerned.

This is the show I will be doing soon.

Soon?

I don't know.

Am I going to have a Drop Dead Fred situation?

We will see.

Drop Dead Scott.

I'm from the How Did This Get Made?

How Did This Get Made?

You know how things get made, but How Did This Get Made?

How Did This Get Made?

It is a crafting podcast where every time we look at a this and we ask how it got made.

He is the Hae-Nong Man himself.

Please welcome back to the show Jason Hae-Nong Manzukas.

Welcome friend.

Thank you, pal.

Hae-Nong Man.

Still going strong.

People still want to scream Hae-Nong Man at me.

I get it all the time myself.

Love it. I love it.

Absolutely love it because it ends the conversation.

And I love that people respect the fact that that means we've reset and that you had people be like, oh no, I wish I'd said it at the end.

Yes, I do have that.

But I must confess, I had someone who said Hae-Nong Man and then wanted to continue and was very upset when I said, well, you realize we've ended the conversation there.

And he was like, what do you mean?

And got upset.

And that's not a real fan.

That's not a real fan.

You know what fans find that guy.

Find him.

You know what to do.

Kill him.

You know what to do.

Welcome back to the show, Jason.

It's so good to see you.

Are you drinking out of that entourage mug or?

No, I'm drinking out of this mug.

Your personal, is that a personal mug that I brought?

Will you not drink out of anyone in any other mug nor glassware that has been used by another human being?

No, I probably would.

Those look, I bet those get washed.

The ones that you guys provide.

I would drink water out of one of your water glasses.

When you go to a restaurant, you don't say, hey, just pour it in my open hands.

When I go to a restaurant, I say, do you have an onsite glass blower?

And if they say no, we do not.

Because then if they don't, obviously for those restaurants that have an onsite glass blower, I ask them to make sure it's a convenience that a lot of Los Angeles restaurants.

Exactly.

That's true.

Actually, I don't remember that a lot of people in the country.

Yeah, they don't have those at your Applebee's.

But we have them in our restaurants here.

If they're not here, you overturn all the tables.

You walk out in a huff.

Yep.

And when they come back, there's an onsite glass blower.

Oh, you better believe it, baby.

But if not, then yes, I just asked them to pour the drink into my hands and I'll wrap it up like a little kitty.

Like a big kitty.

Yeah, big giant kitty.

Because all I drink is handheld milk.

Jason, what's been going on with you?

God damn it, Scott.

What's up?

A lot.

Yeah.

I mean, I wanted to say, you got a hold of me and you were like, I got to get back on the show.

I got a lot of updates.

Got a lot on your chest.

I don't really have any updates.

I don't really have much going on.

Really?

Nothing going on?

No, same old stuff.

You know, you're still- You know, I'm just like rocking around Los Angeles.

Rocking around NYC.

You know, rocking around New York, you know, playing electric guitar.

Sure, yeah.

Mark marinining it.

I'm out on those streets.

Boomer lives, you know what I'm saying?

Lock those gates.

Everything.

The garage is the garage.

Yeah.

You and Mark have very similar lifestyles, I've noticed.

We do.

We're very similar.

How are you, more importantly?

You know what I feel like?

Nobody turns the goddamn tables and says, how are you?

You know what?

The thing about turning tables that I've always wondered is like, can't you just switch food?

Like, why do you have to actually turn the whole table around?

Well, because that's why every restaurant here in Los Angeles has been installed with a lazy Susan.

Yes, exactly.

Also, if the thing is going to move that much, I feel like the laziest is a table that doesn't move.

Yeah, is a sedentary.

A sudently Susan is basically like a very active tabletop.

It's working very hard.

Yes, exactly.

She doesn't seem lazy at all.

No, it should be a suddenly Susan.

How about an active Susan?

A suddenly Susan?

That's not great.

What?

What, because of the Brooke Shields show?

Yeah.

Well, because, you know, suddenly Susan is facing the way I am.

Suddenly Susan is standing beside me.

Sure.

We got to duet on that at some point.

Suddenly Susan.

Save it for Schwartz, baby.

Not interested.

No?

Come on, baby.

Put a note down.

You and Schwartz can see it next time.

No, I'm not having Schwartz back on this show.

All that's over.

Oh yeah.

You guys are feuding?

Yeah, no more.

No more with him.

Oh, la la.

Who are some of your comedy feuds with?

Who are my comedy feuds with?

That's such a good question.

Okay.

If you were to be on much like Paul Scheer Family Feud, but it was Comedy Feud.

Okay.

And it was, you had your team of comedy friends and then you had a team of comedy adversaries.

Who would be on your team of comedy friends?

Who would be on your team of comedy adversaries?

Wow.

Great question.

Thank you so much.

My team of comedy friends would be myself, Lauren Lapkus, Paul F. Tompkins.

There's only five spots.

Sure.

Five spots.

And one of them has to do weekend update.

Neil Campbell and John Gabris.

Now let me ask you a question.

The opposing team would be you and whatever round of dumb dumbs you can rally together.

Cause I just took all your A team baby.

Damn it.

Why did I let you pick first?

We didn't even school yard pick it.

You got to pick your entire team first.

Yeah.

Oh man.

Oh boy.

I would love to.

You V me Family Feud would be fun.

Yeah.

Whoever wins, we lose.

Yes.

I would love to go on Family Feud with you.

Do you think, you know, when I just saw Nikki Glaser going to be on dancing with the stars coming up, that's very true.

That's cool.

Yeah.

It's incredible.

We should enter as a team.

I think we should, but I see something like that and I go, I don't even know the steps with how you would get on that show.

Like not only has no one ever approached me nor celebrity, big brother nor anything, but I don't even know like how you're making is not being a celebrity.

No, the mistake you're making is thinking they're going to approach you.

I think if you go ham on one of those shows, you got to go.

After you start a campaign on this show.

Oh, okay.

What show should I go on?

Because that's what I was just going to ask.

I don't think I want to go on celebrity big brother because of the whole like having to be shirtless and naked, you know?

And like, well, why did you like, if you're not going to get shirtless and naked, why did you spend the last two years getting so ripped?

It's crazy.

I did just shredded up dad.

I got that V. Yeah.

You got them.

Come gutters, baby.

Oh, Scott.

Ockerman's come gutters, by the way, that's a t-shirt.

Please.

No, it's not.

It's not even what it said on this show.

Scotty ox, come gutters.

It's just got those things.

You don't even have a Twitter account.

It's like a, it's like a beefcake chest shirt and it just says Scott Ockerman's come gutters.

Guys start making designs in the drip and milk font.

Oh God.

No, no.

Um, what, what show would you go on dancing with the stars?

I don't think so.

I don't think I'm a good dancer.

Well, no, I mean, who is on that show?

I guess, I mean, I guess I would go on and get voted out quickly, but wouldn't you want to go on America's Got Talent and do your magic.

I don't think that you can go on America's Got Talent if you already have like a talent agent.

I see.

Of course.

I feel like, of course I'm up for UTA.

Yeah, of course.

By the way, not invited to a UTA's Emmy party this year.

Oh really?

All I'm doing out there is hashtagging UTA fam.

There is no one rep in UTA more than me.

Not invited.

That's brutal.

Were you?

Yes.

Yeah.

Are you going to go?

I only went one year.

I can't go because I have, how did this get made shows at Largo?

Oh yeah.

I mean, but, but not to get an invite.

That is that's an, and from an invite the previous year where like update for you, you're out of the biz.

I don't like, they think you're out of the biz.

I go one year without having anything eligible and suddenly I'm not invited to their biggest night.

I don't like it.

I don't like the way Emmys tonight, by the way, we had the most important night of the year for us.

And you know, the 12 nights of Emmys.

It culminates tonight.

Yes, exactly.

Yeah.

We got to, we got to check some snubs and some flubs.

We have to.

Okay.

First of all, what do you think was flubbed?

I mean, so much was flubbed.

So many flubs this year.

Not a lot of snubs.

I think snubs got flubbed.

Interesting.

Cause I was actually going to say, I felt like some of those flubs got snubbed.

Well, yeah, maybe the reverse.

You know, cause in my opinion, some of those flubs are pretty big and nobody paid attention to them.

I think some of the snubs were flubbed because they weren't really snubs.

They were like, Oh no, I get why they weren't nominated.

I felt like Mr. Snubaluffagus was snubbed.

I think he was.

You never see him anymore.

You never do.

You know, it's so weird.

He used to be everywhere.

Yeah.

Oh boy.

Um, but uh, what's come on.

It's going really well.

Delighted.

Um, what were we in the middle of?

We have like six active conversations.

We were talking about Emmys previous to that.

We were talking about UTA, uh, someone, someone being represented by UTA.

I don't remember what, Oh, what show would you want to go?

Oh yeah, that's exactly it.

Okay.

I would want to go on the show.

This is not one of those shows.

Exactly.

Look, one of the orders.

Yes.

I would want to go, by the way, it would, I had a library card collection.

I'm not kidding.

I had a visceral reaction to watching an episode of hoarders where I agreed so much with what the woman was saying, who was the hoarder.

Right.

It was clear to me that she was right and the people were wrong.

Wait, who was wrong?

Were people saying she should not be a hoarder?

Yes.

And I was like, Oh no, I'm a hoarder because I agree.

Do they start that by saying something like, if you own more than 15 trash bags and six cat mummies, you might be a hoarder.

Yes.

Jeff Foxworthy.

Jeff Foxworthy hosts it.

Right.

Yep.

Um, and no, they were telling, they, they kept coming up to her and being like, what about this?

Can we throw this away?

Right.

And it was always things that were broken that she was going to fix later.

I have a lot of things that I'm going to fix up later.

What's broken in your life that you're going to fix later?

I got rid of so much stuff.

So true.

My heart.

But you know what?

Somebody is going to come in.

Who's going to know how to fix hearts.

She's going to help me fix this.

I don't know.

It's been close to 50 years.

It hasn't happened yet.

All right.

Um, so what are you, what do you have that you want to fix?

I threw it all away.

It was like, Oh my God, like chairs.

The Bob Dylan special.

I threw so much stuff away after that hoarders revelation.

What'd you throw away?

I mean, uh, if someone's, uh, just, uh, uh, you know, rummaging through Jason Manzuca's dumpsters.

So for example, is that, is that a euphemism?

Ooh, I rummage through Jason Manzuca's dumpsters.

Um, I, I threw away, I, okay.

So at one point I pulled out of the trash.

You pulled out, I pulled out of the trash and came all over the bag.

Right.

And I was like, Oh, did you like that?

Dear and the trash was like, I start you on this kind of thing.

This is, this is bad.

And the trash was like, I can't get pregnant anyway.

And then next thing you know, a little bit of pre-cum did get in there.

Oh, stop it.

And the trash called me like two months later and was like, I'm pregnant.

It's yours.

Oh Jesus.

Um, so now I'm financially supporting a bathroom.

Is that why you did the dictation?

How dare you?

No.

So what is in your trash?

I picked up a chair out of the trash once that was like a beautiful kind of like mid-century chair, blah, blah, blah.

Hold on.

You're saying you're taking stuff out of the trash.

I thought we were talking about what you're leaving.

This is my point.

I pulled it out of the trash, right?

And it had no cushions, no webbing and was messed up.

So I was like, I'm going to fix this chair up.

I then proceeded to, to bring that chair undone.

Didn't do anything everywhere for how many residences for like five residences.

I had it for 18 years.

I never did anything to it.

No.

What was cool about the chair?

It was never a functional chair.

I never sat on the chair once.

What was cool about it?

Why, why do you want it?

It was a beautiful like frame and it was going when it was all said and done, it was going to be like a beautiful kind of mid-century chair.

Sure.

But so what'd you end up doing?

I threw it away.

Just threw it away.

I threw it away.

Did the exact same thing that someone did to...

I returned it to whence it came.

Yes.

How many residences do you think it was at beforehand?

Just probably one.

Yeah.

I was terrible and like I had multiple things like that in my life that I had been like holding onto because they were a project I was going to get to later.

Right.

When I was like a woodworker.

Like what?

I'm not, that's never me.

Have you ever completed a project?

No.

So really?

No, no, no.

Okay.

So you should, you should just know that about yourself.

I don't do projects.

So know that about yourself now.

Just like buy stuff new.

Yeah.

That's literally, that's my life.

Yeah.

And if you buy something, you should throw something away.

I agree with that as well.

Yeah.

It doesn't have to be the exact same size because if you're by a chair, you can't find something else.

Chair size.

No, no, no.

But I agree.

You got to, you have to really limit the amount of stuff that can fill your house because otherwise you're surrounded by junk.

Yes, exactly.

Do you live in a junkyard?

I've never seen your house.

Yes.

I live in, okay.

Or the guy who does fat Albert.

I live in not so much of a junkyard, but more of a trash heap.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Do you live like on top of the top of old trash trash heap?

Yeah.

Do you live in a little tiny shack up there that has a crooked stove pipe that comes out of crooked stove pipe?

I've never understood that.

I live in, I live in like a claymation house.

I live like in Isle of dogs.

Right.

Oh my gosh.

Holy cow.

How are you guy?

Uh, I'm good.

I'm good.

Don't worry about me.

We have a big show.

So worried about you.

Yeah, no, don't worry about me.

Why are you doing the podcast shirtless?

I want you to do, I want you to do celebrity.

Um, um, um, Oh boy.

This could go anywhere.

No, no, I was nothing.

Nothing.

Oh, for the shows.

Not the big brother.

Yeah, no.

We never got to your show either.

We got off on the hoarders though.

Alone.

What is alone?

Alone is a show.

It's not like a celebrity show or whatever, but it's a show where they put somebody out in the wilderness and you try and survive.

Okay.

Celebrity alone.

Yeah.

I want to do celebrity alone.

First, first install the show with bear grills where bear grills like makes you like jump out of a helicopter and like eat grubs.

Would you like to jump out of a helicopter?

I don't know if bear grills is watching.

Pretty cool.

That was the thing.

I was going to sign up for amazing race.

Uh, at one point in the early two thousands, uh, my, my father, I was going to do it with my father and I got my father all into it.

And Mike White and his father did it.

Well, this was pretty, this was five years earlier or something like that, but I heard from the casting people, I knew a casting person that they were looking for someone like me and I mean, no, they were looking for a breakdown went up for Scott.

They were looking for, well, I won't even say, okay.

Um, someone with those come gutters.

But um, we're looking for some ripped up comedian with come gutters.

So I, I filled out all the applications and then I went to magic mountain one day and went on one roller coaster.

It was like, started feeling queasy.

I was like, this is what the amazing race feels like 24 hours of the day.

A roller coaster.

Yeah.

Just having to be on planes all day and jumping out of shit.

And it's like, ah, who needs it?

Oh my God.

So I never turned it in.

Oh my God.

Yeah.

So I don't know what show I would want to get that.

I would like, I now would like you to go on wheel of amazing race wheel of fortune.

I would like you and Paul F to join celebrity.

No, you and Scott, Scott, please.

No celebrity amazing race.

No, I can barely last two hours with him and doing a show.

Um, I feel bad for those people on shows like the good place who are, uh, have to hang out all day with him.

Um, let me, so barely on that show.

So alone for you.

I would do wheel.

I would do one of my favorite shows.

Honestly.

It's great.

I would do wheel of fortune.

Okay.

I get that.

That's a game show.

Um, I like game shows.

I think I would do and I don't think I would do well, but I would do jeopardy.

You would do jeopardy.

Okay.

So celebrity jeopardy or regular jeopardy.

No, no celebrity cause it's easier.

Yeah.

It's easier.

Yeah.

So let me ask you some questions.

What year did the war of 1812 already blown it?

You've already blown it.

What does that mean?

I've blown it.

What does that mean?

I'm sorry, because it's a question.

Yeah.

This is the year that the war of 1812 started.

What is 1942?

Okay.

You've already blown it.

Do you have general knowledge about things or are you kind of a dummy?

No, I'm kind of a dummy.

Like, what do you know about history?

I'm smart about the things I'm smart about, but like, like exactly history, geography.

If you had to say something.

I know the earth is 2000 years old.

Okay.

This is maybe, are you getting this history on Sundays by chance?

Yeah.

No.

Yeah.

Um, well, do you know anything about world war one?

Sure.

Who was involved?

Who were the parties involved?

Okay, great.

But the parties involved were the Whigs, the Tories, the Republicans, the Democrats.

Oh dear.

Right?

Independence.

Yeah.

The independence.

That's what independence is all about.

The green party.

Um, do you know anything about the framers, about the constitution?

The framers?

Yeah.

I mean, they like the, I go to some people in echo park.

Um, and yeah, you had this chair with a nice frame.

No, no, this is for art.

They frame.

I put frames on all my art and I hang it on my walls.

The framers.

Sure.

Somebody just told me this fact that literally blew my mind.

Okay.

And this might be, I don't know what you mean by literally, but okay.

This might be it.

I mean that like the fact opened its mouth and blew my mind's dick.

Okay.

All right.

Like my mind part of the brain is the mind's dick.

Would you say the medulla oblongata?

No, the, the, the thalamus.

Oh yeah.

The thalamus.

Very sensitive.

Rock hard.

The thalamus.

The hypo thalamus.

I did not mean to get you started on this.

All right.

So what is the fact that blew your mind?

The there, when they wrote and signed the constitution, the oldest person who signed it was 34 years old.

I know.

Yeah.

That was old back then.

That was like a hundred back then.

The idea that they had written and done all of what they did to make this country and many of them were in their late twenties.

Yes.

I think there was like Hancock or someone who was 24 or something.

Jefferson was like 28 or something like that.

It's crazy.

It's nuts.

The idea that they were so young and did such a perfect job and we are so old and have done so little.

Speak for yourself.

No, you've done like less than I have.

What you've done like almost nothing.

My two Emmys would say difference baby.

Not even nommed over here.

Not even snubbed.

Not even flubbed.

All right, Jason.

We have to get to our first guest.

Is that all right?

It's so good seeing you.

Oh, I would love to.

You know what we didn't do that we say we're going to do every time?

What is that?

Talk about comic books.

Oh yeah.

Well we should have our own podcast for that.

Although, uh, you know, who would listen?

Um, all the comics creators.

Yeah.

Matt fraction.

We're looking at you.

Kelly Sue DeConnick.

Yeah.

Doc Shainer.

He drew a Hainong man shirt into Terrific's number six.

I believe.

Thank you.

Uh, we need to get to our first guest.

She is an amateur chef.

I wonder how, uh, I guess I'm an amateur chef in the sense of I've made a few.

One of my favorite shows about amateur chefs is a nailed it.

It is hosted by our friend, a friend of the show.

And by that, I mean she was on once and didn't had never heard it before and didn't know what she was doing.

Really?

I bet she was hilarious.

Nonetheless.

She was great.

Um, and uh, I find that a lot that people come on the show having never heard of it and not find it a lot.

I also found out an interesting fact about her.

She is offer only.

Um, all right, let's get to our first guest.

Um, she is a, an amateur chef.

Please welcome Eugenia wobbles.

British baking show.

Is that your catchphrase?

Are you on that?

I was on the great British baking show.

I'm a baker.

I was on the great British baking show.

Are you clarifying something or why did you shout that the minute that you, you were introduced?

Oh, because I love to bake.

You know my children shouted it because you love to bake.

Got it.

My children are all grown up.

Oh wow.

So see her an older woman.

I'm an older woman than I'm British.

I mean she could be 38 she could be 32 for all we know.

99 99 99.

That's as many problems as Jay Z had.

I live in a cottage.

I have butter.

I have a flower garden and I smell like we got butter.

You smell like skin.

Yes.

I have butter flower garden.

Those are the, those are your possess.

You're like an opposite of a hoarder.

You have butter and flower garden.

I smell like skin and that's it.

You smell like skin.

Can I smell?

Oh sure.

I take a whiff.

Yeah, that's skin.

That's the skin smell.

I never tell a lie.

I'm British.

It's interesting.

You smell like British skin.

It smells like cottled jam and a bunch of pudding flops.

And if you know jam and a bunch of pudding flops and I, I'm so excited to be here because your excitement is bubbling over a lot like a, like a pots that is a, has a, you know, water in it is boiling.

I don't know.

I'm trying to make an analogy to your baking, but yeah.

Bob's your uncle.

Oh yes.

What does that mean?

I've heard that so many times.

It means it's so simple.

All you have to do is think about it.

Okay.

Got it.

Okay.

And that's all I'll say now.

Were you going to help us figure out other common British phrases?

The meanings of them?

Yeah.

Well I can certainly do that.

I can help you with that of course.

But if I'm here because this is, come on, bake, bake.

Yes.

And I'm here.

This show?

Oh no.

This is comedy.

No CBB.

Come on, bake, bake.

So you, all you saw was CBB and you got that close to it.

Do you think, do you think the first word is C apostrophe M O N come on, bake, bake, bake, bake.

I don't know.

You're an American.

I had, you know, come on, bake, bake.

It would be like Ty Cobb or like corn on the, I don't know.

Cobb comma corn on the, you know, I know someone who makes Cobb houses in Britain, Britain.

What are Cobb houses?

I don't quite know what that is.

Cobb houses.

It's a mixture of mud and water and straw.

So slightly watered down dirt, slightly more water down dirt.

Yes.

This sounds like a very, this does not sound like it's up to code.

These houses.

No, no, no.

Very steady.

And it keeps the heat in and it keeps the cold out.

It's like Adobe.

I hardly know her.

What do you mean?

What do you mean by that?

Exactly.

Adobe.

Adobe reader?

Adobe reader.

That's good.

Anyway, that's just a little joke.

Very little.

Did you want to update it?

No, no, no.

No, you don't want to update your Adobe reader.

And also, I don't know what that is.

I, I don't have a computer.

Why do we have to update Adobe reader?

It's like it was fine.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

Like, you know, you know how to read, you know how to read.

What's there to update?

Exactly.

So you thought this was a competition baking show.

Yes.

Did you bring some of your equipment here?

Of course I did.

I brought a spoonful of flour.

I brought orange sauce.

Tiny amount of flour.

I brought a, yes, in here.

I brought a little spoon and a cup, an empty cup.

Nothing in it?

Okay, great.

So you have one spoonful of flour, some orange what now?

Orange sauce.

Orange sauce?

What is orange sauce?

Yeah, is this like a...

It's orange sauce.

It's sauce.

It's orange sauce.

Is that like orange chicken sauce?

No, no, no, no, no.

It's orange sauce.

It looks orange.

It's orange sauce.

So it's like orange that's been, you know, juiced or something like that?

No, it's orange that's been masticated.

Oh, it's pre-chewed orange.

I masticated it myself.

Yes.

So you spit a masticated orange into a cup.

Yes, yes, yes.

And then you add a little water like a cobhouse.

And you build it all together and it keeps the heat out and the cool in.

Oh, okay.

The sauce does.

Of the cake?

Yes, yes, yes, anyway, and so I came on here because I'm just desperate.

You see, I have my life is just so, you know, my children are all grown up.

Oh, they are.

Oh, sure.

Yeah.

What age did you have your children?

When I was 19.

Oh, wow.

Oh, yeah.

So, but they're still with us.

They must...

No, no.

When you say all grown up, you mean fully grown, meaning dead.

I mean fully grown, having lived full lives and died.

All of their children.

Natural causes.

That's as old as they're going to be.

At an old age.

I have to say natural causes.

That's like...

No, no, no.

I'm just saying they died of natural causes.

Your eyes are darting back and forth.

Really shifty.

So shifty.

Anyway.

Can I ask you a question, Eugenia Wobbles?

Yes.

Did you win your season of Great British Bake Off?

Or are you allowed to say?

No, damn it.

No?

Oh, wow.

That's strong language.

I should have won.

Did you not impress Mary Berry or Paul Hollywood?

I didn't impress them.

It was cake week and I made a mouth cake for my showstopper.

It was a cake in the shape of an open trap.

And they said...

A trap meaning like a trap door?

No, like a mouth trap.

A mouth trap.

Sure.

So it's like a snap and a little cheese.

Oh, a mouse trap.

Wait, you have a lisp?

You're trying to say mouse trap.

Obviously she has a lisp.

I only have a lisp when I say mouse.

Oh, got it.

You just said mouse.

No, it's just one of my little kids.

I'm a quirky British woman.

So I made a cake in the shape of a mouth trap.

And of course I had a little bit of cheese in it.

Yes, of course.

How about a little cake shaped mouth?

No, no, no.

It was sort of...

It was like, I guess I didn't really do the...

A mouse wouldn't be in the shape of a cake.

It would be vice versa.

A mouth shaped cake.

It was a mouth shaped...

Well, you see, I guess, blah, blah, blah.

My creak creak creak.

Cut to the chase.

Oh my God.

Oh wait.

Holy cow.

Fertation, what is happening?

Are you okay?

Are you having a stroke?

Eugenia.

Excuse me.

Did I just press fast forward?

Ms. Wobbles?

I have a hard time...

Here's the thing about me.

I lisp when I say the word mouth and I have a hard time pronouncing creak creak creak critique.

Oh, okay.

I like critiques.

Got it.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

A little post-traumatic stress disorder from Great British Bake Off.

Exactly.

From Paul Hollywood.

Did you say criticism?

Criticism.

Okay.

We just switched to that.

No, no, no.

Because it wasn't a critique.

Oh, you just said it for me.

You did it.

Wow.

It's almost as if you forgot that you had that problem.

That's not at all what happened.

What a miracle.

Anyway, what they said was that my cake wasn't a cake at all.

It was a pudding.

Oh, what's the difference?

I never know when they talk about puddings.

Pudding is floopy and cake is floppy.

Got it.

Those are baking terms.

Yes, you wouldn't understand.

And as a viewer of the show, I know.

Yeah.

Floopy v. floppy.

That's right.

Whoever wins, we lose.

I made a floopy mouth trap that had cheese in the middle of it.

Oh, you should have made a floppy mouth trap.

That's what I didn't know.

And they said they tasted it.

Do you know what they said?

What did they say?

Do you know?

I didn't watch that season.

What did they say?

They said, this is sour.

Sour?

Oh, wow.

What in it was sour?

What were the ingredients?

Well, I put hard boiled eggs.

Okay.

The things that make you fart.

Just in the cake?

I put minced thyme.

Okay.

And by that, I don't mean the herb.

I mean the clock.

Oh, you mean the concept of time?

Yes.

I put the clock and I made it.

Oh, gosh.

Okay.

So like metal shavings.

Yeah.

But also not sour.

Well, yeah.

We haven't gotten to the sour parts yet.

And I put in...

Is this a family recipe?

This is my own creation.

So no, it doesn't exist.

No, no, no.

No one in my family baked.

So everything so far has been savory or metal.

So get to the sour part.

That's my style.

So the sour part was what I did was I took a lemon.

Okay.

We're listening.

I took a lemon.

We're hooked in.

I threw it in the trash.

Oh, did you see that coming?

Just like Ian did with his cake in season three.

Whoa.

Right.

Threw it right in the bin.

Why are your eyes darting back and forth again?

No, I know Ian in season three.

Wait, are you the old grandma who took his cake out of the fridge and like...

No, that's not me.

I didn't do that.

Her name wasn't Eugenia Wobbles.

Anyway.

And then, and then of course I added in some cinnamon and a little bit of vanilla.

Okay.

Also sweet.

And then I made of course my sponge, my sponge for my pudding.

Yes, of course.

But this is, you know, everyone...

For your cake.

My pudding cake.

And everyone's like, that's flappy.

That's flappy.

You need floopy.

Also a bunch of pudding flops.

Yes.

I got gobbled.

Are you all right?

Was there another word you can't say?

Holy cow.

You don't have to rush.

Slow down.

And so, and so yes.

And so that's it.

So those, so those ingredients.

And then I put in, and then I put in a pepper.

Pepper.

A ghost pepper.

All right.

Spicy, but also savory.

And then I, and then...

So far I will say this cake, nay pudding, sounds delicious.

Other than the metal shavings which might slice up your gums.

Other than the indigestible metal shavings.

Well, well, well.

Don't knock it till you've tried it, Bob your uncle.

The minced timepiece.

And then I put in a car charger.

What do you mean?

A car charger.

You know a car charger.

A car charger.

Like for an electric car?

Yeah, no.

A charger for your phone in your car.

Oh, I see.

And then I put in some Sour Patch Kids.

Oh, here we go.

Sour Patch Kids.

And what was the ratio of Sour Patch Kids to?

One hundred percent.

Oh, wait, so all the other ingredients were not in it.

It was just Sour Patch Kids.

Those were just things I thought about putting in it.

I just gave them a dish full of Sour Patch Kids.

And they said it was too sour.

And they said that was a pudding?

I said that was a pudding.

You were trying to make a cake.

You were trying to say it was a cake.

You were trying to make a mouse trap cake.

You said they called it a pudding.

And then you said you put down a bowl of Sour Patch Kids.

I don't think about it too much.

Everything I say is true.

Yeah, you have PTSD from this period.

Well, exactly.

Yeah.

So, you know.

So how was their critique?

Oh, well, it was brutal.

You know, they said, well, I didn't get Star Baker, of course.

And they said, unfortunately, we're going to have to say goodbye to Eugenia Wobbles.

Did they say this before it was time to on the show?

Did they just escort you out?

They did.

They had security escort me out.

Oh, no.

Can you believe it?

Did you get violent?

Of course I did.

I you know, I slapped them.

OK.

I slapped them right in the face.

You said that almost with air quotes.

I slapped them.

What do you say?

Slapped.

What do you mean?

Do you mean you slapped them with knives?

No, no, no.

I don't know.

You don't use knives and baking.

Right.

Yes.

You have big spoons.

Did you slap them with spoons?

Did you paddle their little bottoms?

Well, I certainly you know, I tried to say little bottoms.

I tried to discipline them.

Yes.

Did you paddle their little bottoms?

I didn't see it as me behaving violently.

I just bent Paul Hollywood over my baking station and I whooped him on the tush.

When you say that, you didn't insert anything into his tush.

Of course I inserted things into his tush.

Oh, wait.

Put that down.

What are you making now?

Put that down.

I'm making an orange sauce.

Oh, you're making an orange sauce.

I have some orange sauce, but I'm going to make more.

OK.

So does that mean you have to like chew something up in front of us?

No.

Now, listen.

Oh, sure.

Sure.

We're wrapped with attention.

You're so fascinating.

Scott, do you have a life insurance policy?

Are you selling life insurance policy?

I know.

I'm just curious if you have one.

I believe I do.

Do you?

Also, who's the beneficiary?

Yeah, who's the beneficiary?

I would imagine that it's, you know, the widow cool off, obviously.

Is that a substantial life insurance?

I'm speaking.

Don't you sniff around here.

I'm asking for a friend.

Yeah.

Don't you sniff around until it's time.

Until I'm fully grown.

I'm just saying.

I mean, I like where Eugenia Wobbles is going with this.

Please continue.

Why are you asking about my life insurance policy?

I'm just curious.

It's just a random.

We're just getting to know each other.

Sure.

But I mean, are you?

My children had life insurance policies.

Oh.

It's so smart that they did this.

Good for the whole family.

You know, of course, I was a beneficiary as a mother.

And I.

Oh, as a mother.

And all of your children, all of your dead children.

They didn't have children of their own.

Had you as the beneficiary of their life insurance policy?

Were all of your children barren?

This is interesting.

All of my children had no children.

Okay.

So you're starting to talk different.

I was the beneficiary.

And of course, and then I took up baking, you know, around the time.

I'm just now noticing.

Around the time that they were murdered?

Oh.

They died of natural causes.

Sorry, sorry.

But you took up baking around that time.

Yeah.

What's around that time?

I'm noticing that you are wearing quite a lot of expensive looking jewelry.

It's almost like you're, you know, in a rap group in the eighties or something.

The amount of chains you have.

It's incredible.

MC Hammer.

Is that your catchphrase?

No, no.

My catchphrase is Great British Baking Show.

Oh, okay.

Now listen.

Yes.

No, we're listening.

I love it.

Now listen, reset.

Yeah, I love it.

Yeah.

It's almost like a hicknock man.

What do you got?

Yeah.

Okay.

So as you all know, I am a- Sure.

We all know these facts.

We all know.

Whatever you're about to say, we obviously all know it.

We all know.

I am an amateur baker.

Yes.

Got it.

That was in your intro.

Great British Baking Show.

Yes.

And I thought that this was a baking show.

Right?

Right.

Oh, so this is a recap.

Yes.

Okay.

Previously on Comedy Baking.

This is a mid show recap?

Got it.

Let's continue.

I'm just summing up my whole thing.

You're an amateur baker.

You thought this was a baking show.

Your children died of national- Come on, bake.

That's it.

They did.

Ah, Theresa May.

Boris Johnson.

Theresa might.

Eugenia Wobbles.

I barely know her.

My name is not Theresa May.

No.

Okay.

So here I am.

Yes.

I'm going to bake for you all today.

Oh great.

Okay.

Let's get going.

Are you interested?

We have to go to a break soon if that's okay.

Great.

But we can get- Oh, well that's perfect.

Yeah.

We can maybe put it in the oven or whatever.

I don't know what your process is.

Now why don't you tell us here what the ingredients you have in front of you are and what you're going to make.

Okay.

Spoonful of flour.

Spoonful.

A tiny spoonful.

One spoonful.

Empty cup.

Empty additional spoon.

Okay.

Got it.

Empty spoon.

We have the orange sauce.

Orange sauce.

Which you've made more since then.

Yes, I made more while we've been talking.

Sure.

A handful of apple seeds.

Oh, okay.

And then of course- Usually a handful of apples is one, but a handful of apple seeds could be up to 40.

Did you get those from Johnny?

Here's Johnny.

Johnny Appleseed.

Eugenia.

Are you all right?

Eugenia.

Oh yes, no I know what you're talking about.

No, I did not get these apple seeds from Johnny.

No, no, no, no.

Got it.

Okay.

I got them from my own orchard.

I have a flower garden and I have an apple orchard.

Oh my gosh.

So butter, flower garden, and an orchard.

And those are all the things I own.

Oh, and a Rolex.

Oh, okay.

And so I take these apple seeds and- Sure.

Rolex is not what you chopped up and put in your cake pudding.

No, you would add- No, no, no.

I chopped up a Timex.

Now the apple seeds, of course, as you know, are used to make arsenic.

But for our purposes- Oh, interesting.

Got very shifty.

Interesting.

I'm just saying- For our purposes, what are you going to make?

For our purposes, they're going to be apple pie.

Okay, great.

Apple pie.

Okay, great.

And the rest of which are apple seeds, orange sauce, and- A spoonful of flour.

A spoonful of flour.

And an empty spoon.

Two handfuls of yeast.

Two handfuls.

Hot, hot yeast.

It has to be hot.

Hot yeast.

Yes.

Your skin is bubbling.

I mean, maybe you smell like skin because your skin is bubbling off with all this and you've been holding this hot yeast.

Well, you have to- Hot yeast.

Listen, as a baker, your hands are...

You know when you play guitar and you get calluses?

Sure.

You know that.

Do you play guitar?

No, I've just heard of it.

And so, as a baker, as a baker- Well, on the Great British Bake Off, when you hurt yourself, they cover you in blue tape so that you don't bleed into the cake.

I know.

Oh, yes.

And it's also a warning to the other bakers.

It's like, watch out.

This can happen.

Is it sort of like basketball?

You can't bleed on the court?

That's exactly right.

Right.

Yeah.

Because then you get penalized.

Yeah.

You get penalized.

What are you saying?

And you have to do two point shots all day.

Pitalized.

And you break the rules.

So you know a lot about basketball and guitar.

Yeah.

But not so much about baking because you haven't been combining any of these elements.

Well, wait, just wait.

I'm just showing you my ingredients.

You're just kneading that hot yeast.

Yeah.

Which is burning your skin off.

Which really appears to be very hot, almost boiling.

Your skin seems to be sliding off into the yeast.

You are getting burns.

Okay, perfect.

Now we add in the apples.

Now you add in the apples.

Okay.

So you're crushing up the apple seeds.

All right.

So now do we put this in the oven or something like this?

No, no, no.

We put it in a dark closet.

Dark closet.

Okay.

Well, we have one right here.

Okay, perfect.

Perfect.

Okay.

All right.

So now how long is it going to take to, because we need to go to a commercial, will it take five minutes or so?

Or?

13 hours.

Okay.

Well, minimum.

Minimum.

What's maximum?

Yeah.

What's the other side?

A lifetime.

Oh, God.

And when you say a lifetime, just until you're dead?

Yeah.

Well, look, we need to take a break.

When we come back, we're going to have more Eugenia Wobbles.

Woo hoo!

Oh, wow.

And say your catchphrase, of course.

Woo woo Wobbles.

Great British Baking Show!

Great.

And of course we'll have more Jason Mantzoukas.

Hey-o!

Say your catchphrase.

Hey, Nongman.

Got it.

All right.

And when we come back, we'll have someone from my past.

I don't know if they have a catchphrase or not, but this is so exciting.

I'm sure they do.

Yeah.

We'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang.

Comedy Bang Bang.

We're back here with Jason Mantzoukas.

And he is back from, he took the opportunity to go take a squirt while I...

Oh, man.

I just sat in front of the urinal and I pushed pee right out of my pee hole.

Now you sat with it, your ass to the urinal though, right?

Yeah.

And I peed all over the floor.

That's how it works, right?

Do you know the best kinds of desserts always have a little bit of squirt in them?

Really?

Yes.

Do you mean the...

Do you mean female ejaculate?

Oh, please.

No.

I mean the grapefruit soda.

The grapefruit soda, yes, of course.

They can touch a squirt.

Eugenia Wobbles is here.

You put squirt in everything that you have.

Beep boop, beep boop.

It's me, Eugenia Wobbles.

Is that your catchphrase?

Are you a robot?

Can I ask you a quick question, Eugenia Wobbles?

Are you a robot?

Now listen, I'm not a robot.

I think that's your catchphrase.

That's your catchphrase.

Now listen is 100% your catchphrase.

No, my catchphrase is Great British Bakers, sir.

I am not a robot.

No, no, no.

I'm a older British woman and I've taken on baking as a hobby.

And just to sum up- What did you do as a profession?

Oh, as a profession, I was a doctor's wife.

Okay.

Oh, okay.

I guess you don't need to work when you're a doctor.

Dr. Wobbles?

Exactly.

Dr. Wobbles.

What was his first name?

Dr. Wobbles died of natural causes.

Oh.

His first name was Fall.

Fall?

Fall Wobbles.

Dr. Fall Wobbles.

Yes, he was named for his favorite season.

Oh, that's beautiful.

That's great.

He was born- How did they know that his favorite season was Fall?

As a baby, how did they know?

He was named for his favorite season.

They just knew he came out and he was looking around and they're like, oh, it looks like he's looking at leaves.

He's most love for- So he was born in Fall?

Yeah.

He was in a room though, so there were no leaves there, but it looks like he's looking at leaves.

His eyes were going around the room like he's looking at the Wobbling.

And of course, and of course- What's interesting is that after you wobble, you often fall.

And so he is someone who is Fall Wobbles.

I know.

Oh, the whole town got such a kick out of that.

The whole town.

They were all involved.

The whole town was involved at our wedding.

Oh, wow.

And he was the town doctor.

He had a small malpractice.

A small malpractice.

Of what?

A small practice.

Excuse me.

Because if you say a small malpractice, that means he did something wrong.

Oh, no, no, no.

Yeah, you were just mispronouncing small.

Well, we all do- Small mal.

Small malpractice.

Small practice.

Small, small practice.

Small practice.

He did dentistry.

He did surgeries.

Did he do a drop dead Fred situation?

Oh, yes.

He did have a DDFS.

He had a room where he did DDFS tests.

Is that the room where it happened?

Yeah.

Listen.

Why would you have seen Hamilton?

It's not British.

So he did all manner of- All manner of doctors.

From snoot to toot.

He just did it all.

Snoot to toot.

And how long did he have his practice before he ultimately passed away due to natural causes?

Yes, he had his practice for 89 years.

Oh, like 89 years?

He was 107 at least.

Yes, yes.

He was a little man.

He was a very old man.

I know.

He's a doctor.

He can live forever.

Wait a second.

He just physician heal thyself.

Yeah.

Exactly.

He was an alchemist of medicine.

Oh, okay.

I don't know what that means.

Creating gold from metals?

Yes.

He can make any sort of metal and any sort of cure for anything.

But for medicine, so he could make like body parts, other body parts?

Yes.

He could make a hand afoot.

That sounds like rogue doctoring.

I'm going to look at your hands, by the way, because like, they have high heels on.

I'm fancy.

Now listen.

There he is again.

I swear.

If you're playing at home, take that shot.

Now listen.

So he was of course a small country doctor.

Of course he was.

And you know, he died of natural causes.

He could cure himself of anything except for death.

Right.

He was fully grown.

He was not a Lazarus type of situation where he could be brought back to life.

No, I was the beneficiary of his life and now, oh, my apple pie is ready.

It took 13 hours.

Min.

No, I lied.

Why would you lie about something like that?

I'm just kidding.

It was a joke.

I never lie.

I always tell the truth except for that moment when it was a lie, but I meant it as a joke.

Miss Wobbles, I do have a question since the untimely death of your husband, have you been dating at all?

Yes, Jason Manzukas is famously single, has been looking for someone to heal his heart.

I'm just saying like, I don't know if you're open to dating right now, but like you speak of healing hearts.

My husband, a doctor, the small country doctor.

Yes, fall wobbles.

He was a cardiologist.

Well, of course he did.

He did technology.

He did surgery.

He did cardiology.

He did it all.

And he taught me a little bit about mending hearts.

All you have to do is take out a lefty-jokes policy, maybe a bit of his hair.

That's all you have to do.

Is that it?

I'd be thrilled to help you.

All right, well, take that out of the oven.

We'll let it cool.

We need to get to our next guest if that's okay.

Sorry, I need to get some WD-40 on that oven.

And I believe she farted.

Yeah, she also farted, yes.

Snooty toot.

It smells like you've been holding that one in for 99 years.

It smells like skin in here.

Yes.

Smells like those hard-boiled eggs.

Thank you for you.

All right, we need to get to our next guest.

This is exciting.

This is my producer every once in a while just tells me who's on the show right as we're about to start.

And she told me that we have someone from my past is on the show.

So I don't know who this is.

And she's behind the door.

So she might want to...

Close your eyes.

Oh, that's a game.

Okay, closing my eyes.

Okay, don't listen to my voice because you all know who it is.

So just kind of like...

I can hear you right now.

Well, you know what I mean.

Okay, so keep your eyes closed.

Okay, they're all closed.

And ready?

I am very ready.

Steady.

Okay, I'm steady.

I'm giving it away.

And wait, so someone I know has said the word steady a lot?

Oh, yeah, like you don't know.

Ready?

Open your eyes.

Hi.

Hello.

Hi.

Hello.

Hi, I'm Jason.

Jason.

Wait, Auggie?

Auggie?

Oh my God, Auggie.

What do you mean?

It's so good to...

Auggie Augerman.

We sat next to each other in every class from junior high to high school.

Oh, yeah.

Auggie Augerman?

Or Auggie is short for Augerman.

That's your nickname.

My first name is Augustina, but people call me Auggie.

Oh, wow.

My first name is Eugenia.

Your last name is Eugenia?

Well, my first name is Eugenia.

Her last name is Wobbles.

Was I introducing you in gray?

It was Eugenia comma Wobbles?

Eugenia Wobbles.

Oh, is Wobbles all caps?

Yes.

So, yeah.

Wait, why is your brow furrowed?

Let me uncrease that if I could.

Okay, maybe the microphone's away.

Maybe you'll recognize me more without this headphones on.

Move aside the microphone if you could.

Hi.

Yeah.

I mean, it's been so long since I've been in high school.

I know.

And you're not really on Facebook, or at least you're not responding to the Facebook group.

No, I'm definitely not on Facebook.

I'm off the grid a bit.

But your last name is Augerman, A-U-G-G-E-R.

Oh my God.

A-U-G-G-E-R.

That's how I say it.

That's a good impression.

It's an old school challenge.

Did you used to razz him in school?

I mean, we were like two peas in a pea pod.

Oh, cool.

That's right.

We never peed in any kind of pea pod, as far as I recall.

Oh, wait.

Actually, do you remember?

I was in a pea pod, but it was a coffee cup.

What?

Oh, man.

Did you squirt into a coffee cup?

See?

That's why I don't use the coffee cups here at Earwolf, because I believe you pee in them.

Yes.

That doesn't sound like me.

It was Samora Markkson's class.

Oh, a lot.

In Spanish?

Yes.

I took French.

Well, so did I.

Oh, but she taught French?

I don't recall who- No, we snuck into the Spanish class.

This is insane.

Yeah.

Like, you don't remember.

We snuck into the Spanish class, because we hated everybody that was in Spanish.

I love old high school hygiene stories.

I know.

I love this.

Oh, my God.

No, finish it.

Reminiscing.

Go ahead, Scotty.

Yeah, go on, Scott.

I don't remember this story, because what?

Well, we had our ... What is that period called when you ... Steady Hall.

We had Steady Hall together.

Free period, yeah.

Right, yeah.

We always signed up for Steady Hall together, so that we could- So we could what?

Well, whatever.

I mean, I did have free period.

You always would call me and say, which period are you signing up for free period, and we'd sign it.

And we'd talk.

I don't remember that.

I mean, I- Yikes.

But look, it's been a long time, but it's great to see you.

This isn't ... Okay, let's see.

What would you remember?

Yeah, I mean- We killed a raccoon.

Whoa.

Killed a raccoon.

Ooh.

I mean, to see if it would die.

Yeah.

That sounds like something you would do.

See if it would ever be fully grown?

Yes, and it did get fully grown.

Oh, my God.

How ... I don't recall that.

Where did we do this?

Oh, on the green belt?

What's the green belt?

What?

In Savannah, Georgia?

Oh, okay.

So I see maybe where some of the misconception is lying is I was only in Savannah, Georgia for approximately six weeks before I- Yes.

Right, right, right.

Before I moved to California.

Right.

No, no, no.

Me too, me too, me too, but do you remember?

Hashtag me too, but do you remember- Oh, please don't hashtag that on this show.

Hashtag me too.

But do you remember because you were like, I was born in Savannah, Georgia, and then six weeks later I moved to California.

So when we turned 16 and we got our license, we drove to Savannah, Georgia.

Are you dumb?

Yeah.

Are you dumb?

Hey, come on.

Listen, now.

Are you dumb?

I'll slightly take it from her, but not from the likes of you.

Yeah, no, best friends can do that to each other.

I love it.

Guys, that's a t-shirt, right?

Scott's face and just are you dumb question mark?

Are you dumb?

And then I don't know if- It's a shirt.

Yeah, all right.

I don't know if you guys have seen him with the shirt off, but the back could just be a naked picture of his cum gutters.

Oh, yeah.

You get it too.

Wait, so did he have- Adam, you have cum gutters on your back.

No, no, no.

Did he have the cum gutters in high school?

Oh, yeah.

I think he was born with the cum gutters.

Cum gutta was my nickname.

It was?

How so?

So wait, your name is Wobbles Cum Gutter Eugenia?

Yes.

Cum gutta was my nickname when I was a prefect.

Oh, at Hogwarts?

Yes.

All of the Ockermans have cum gutters.

Oh, really?

That's true.

You know the rest of my siblings?

Did you hit your damn head, Scotty boy?

I might have.

I mean, look, you live as long as I have, you're going to hit your head occasionally.

I literally have lived as long as you have.

We have the same birthday, dummy.

Whoa.

What is my- What is our birthday?

Yeah.

We'll just say it at the same time.

Okay, here we go.

Three, two, one.

Sorry, three knows one.

Sorry.

Three knows one.

July 16th.

It's July 2nd, 19.

Oh, well, let's not say that.

Because we feel old.

Sure, yeah.

We feel so old.

Don't you just feel like you're 16 still though?

Like cruising down the 101?

For a bruising, sure, but- Yes.

You guys would just cruise the 101?

Oh, we would absolutely cruise the 101.

Why would we come all the way up here?

That's so cool.

That sounds so lovely.

When we went to Disneyland on our senior trip.

We lived by Disneyland though.

Why would we take the 101?

Seems a little out of the way.

Well, we had to get snacks.

Can I say something?

And I'm sorry to interject here.

Sure, no, it's okay.

I'm just trying to jog my memory here.

Here's the thing, Scott, that I just want to make sure you're understanding.

Augie has come here to reconnect with you.

Yeah, no.

And the way you're acting, frankly, is as if you've never met this person before.

I only am acting in that manner.

It's heartbreaking to watch her- Yeah, I'm only acting in that manner because I don't know whether I've actually met this person before.

Oh my God.

But she's telling you all the specifics that I know about your life she knows.

The what, the 101?

Yes.

And that you grew up near Anaheim and Savannah for six weeks.

I said that.

No, Augie just said it.

I said that.

Is that your catchphrase?

I'm trying.

But look, I- I let them all know about- She knew about the Cumgutters?

The Ackerman Cumgutters.

Well, the information that she's described could be easily accessible on my Wikipedia page.

Oh, yeah, like I know what Wikipedia is.

You don't know what Wikipedia is?

What is it?

Let me test you.

What's Wikipedia?

Sounds like a way to clean your house.

Wow.

Yeah, I mean- The Wikipedia method?

Yeah, you don't know what Wikipedia is.

That checks out.

Look, okay, so give me some more facts about it because I don't have my yearbooks.

I don't- Oh, I know.

I haven't seen anyone since then.

Do you remember I used to be bulimic?

I sure remember someone being bulimic in high school.

Was that you?

Someone being bulimic?

You cured me?

Well, I mean- Cured you?

I used to be bulimic because you taught me how to be bulimic.

Wow.

Okay.

You were a bulimic.

You were one of the Dr. Rubbles.

Hold on, hold on.

You guys didn't know Scott was bulimic?

No.

I'm not like an alchemist of a doctor or anything like this.

I- Is that how your bod gets so ripped up?

Well, he cured himself.

Oh.

Like a physician?

Like a physician.

Like a physician, heal thyself.

Avengers, physician, heal thyself.

Look, I don't think that I would teach you how to be bulimic.

You weren't teaching me on purpose.

You weren't like, hey, fatty.

It's just by example?

No.

I never said, hey, fatty, do you?

You never usually- Nor would I now.

Usually.

What do you mean usually?

I'm not saying you never said it.

I did say that to you?

I'm so sorry.

You said it.

But we were kids.

Was Scott like a bully in high school?

No, no, no, no.

We were best friends.

I mean, we bullied everybody else.

Oh, no.

You guys were bullies.

We were bullies big time.

I don't remember that.

Okay.

Just like a bully to say that.

You know what I mean?

Totally.

Like a conversation bully?

Uh-huh.

Yes.

Well, we pissed in a lot of teacher's cups.

A lot?

Yes.

I don't remember one.

What the fuck is going on?

Whoa.

Please.

I'm going to ask you.

I'm sorry.

Please.

No.

You're not going to say that in English language?

Yes.

My reader has been updated.

I know every single Adobe word you can possibly say.

I'm sorry.

I don't.

This is such a bummer.

Actually, this is crazy.

Do you have a picture of you from back then?

Because people change.

And I did talk to one person from high school that I ...

Back when the internet was in its nascent stages and I didn't know to whom I was speaking, the name was sort of familiar.

And her picture was so much different that when I finally saw a picture of her from back then, I was like, oh, of course.

So if you have a picture of yourself from back then, maybe it'll jog my memory.

I probably have a picture in ... I mean, I brought a picture book of ... What is it called again?

High School?

No, a picture book.

Yearbook?

Yearbook.

Yes.

A picture book.

You brought a yearbook.

I brought a yearbook.

Oh, great.

I don't have any of mine, so great.

Wait, but who did you see from high school that you didn't remember?

Just a friend of mine that I ... It would have been a friend of mine too, Scott.

What the fuck?

Jamie.

Jamie?

Yeah.

Jamie?

Jamie Lamson?

Yeah.

Wait, hold on.

Wait, so you do know Jamie Lamson?

Yeah, of course I know Jamie Lamson.

Oh, okay.

We know Jamie Lamson.

We dated Jamie Lamson.

We both dated Jamie Lamson?

Yeah.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Are you pansexual or- Oh, yeah, let's talk about my sexuality.

You're giving me hints.

I'm just picking up the breadcrumbs.

You know that I am pansexual.

Okay.

We didn't have a name for it back then.

I know.

Yeah.

You came up with the name.

You just were like, I'll take all comers, I guess.

I said I'll take all comers.

As long as they're in them gutters.

Look, so you know Jamie Lamson?

Yeah, of course I know Jamie Lamson.

Where do you know Jamie Lam- This is getting so tense.

Where do I know- Because you dated her and I ... Yeah, I did date Jamie Lamson.

Yeah, we dated Jamie Lamson in high school.

At the same time?

Yes, queen.

Oh, boy.

I remember Jamie cheating on me.

She wouldn't tell me who.

Probably with whom.

Probably with me.

Yeah, I guess.

This is water under the bridge, mon.

Oh, wow.

Really?

Is he your mother?

Mon, not mom.

I believe that was a Jamaican mon.

Yeah.

First you call me queen and then mon.

Okay, so this- Can I ask a quick question?

Yes.

Okay.

Because I just really want to ... For me and Ms. Wobbles- Woo woo!

Ms. Eugenia.

Is your arriving here, Augie, due to perhaps unfinished business?

I mean, I will say that I have ... One of the reasons we sort of stopped talking was because I got married right out of high school.

Oh, wow.

Really?

Like the day after graduation?

Yes, you were invited and you didn't come.

Well, I mean, I was celebrating.

Oh, so now you remember that.

Oh, that's a giveaway right there.

I can remember not going to places, sure.

But you remember not going to Augie's wedding?

No, I remember ... Well, yes, I remember not going to Augie's wedding because I didn't go to a wedding the day after graduation.

I don't remember specifically choosing not to go to a wedding.

Why did you decide to not go to your best friend's wedding?

No, that's the part I don't remember.

It's not a Julia Roberts situation.

Was he supposed to be the maid of honor?

Yes, Jason.

Were you supposed to give- Why did you say his name right and not queen or mon?

He's wearing a name tag.

No, listen.

I had a question.

Was your wedding cake flat?

It was ... I don't know how to explain it.

It was sort of like in the shape of a mouse.

Or wait, sorry.

Are you saying mouth?

I'm saying mouse.

Like a this.

I'm pointing to- Yeah, your mouth.

You have a lisp.

Yeah, you have a lisp as well.

That sounds beautiful.

To whom did you get married?

James Carnegie.

James Carnegie?

JC?

Yeah, JC.

Yeah, we used to call him JC superstar.

We would do like all the time.

Anytime he walked through the halls, we'd be like ... Okay, yeah.

I mean, not everyone has the same level of musicality that ... Okay, sure.

Is that what you would sing when walking down the aisle?

This is what it's like when you and Schwartz are on.

Never again.

Hashtag never again.

Okay, thanks for hashtagging that.

You married JC?

Yeah, I married JC.

I'm going to come.

We haven't spoken.

JC and I just got divorced and won't- When?

There it is.

Oh, I see what's going on.

Whoop, there it is.

Scott, Scott.

Yeah, yeah.

You want to talk to me privately?

Scott, get over here.

Okay.

No, I'll come too.

I think, yeah.

All right, come on over here, you G.

I'll check my Facebook over here in the corner.

I think that Augie is divorced and is trying to reconnect with you.

I looked for you on social media, did not find you.

Came to the studio in order to reconnect potentially as lovers.

Okay, well, I mean, what should I do?

I mean, how should I handle this situation?

Kiss her.

Wait, no, I- Make her yours.

No, I want to turn her down.

Make her yours.

No, no, no, I'm happily married.

Say yes to the dress.

Is that the show you want to be on?

Yes.

Celebrity, say yes to the dress.

Flip or flop, come on.

Oh, celebrity, flip or floppy.

That sounds like putting her cakes.

Yes, flip your flop and give her a kiss.

Yeah.

No, look, I'm happy- Shag the rag.

Eat the pie.

Wait, have sex with her when she's on her beard?

On her beard, yes.

Oh, no.

Oh, is that what that means?

Yes.

With the sanitary napkin.

Oh, dear.

Look, I'm not available.

I'm hashtag not available.

What?

Come on.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

Hashtag me too.

Open it up.

When I said, what should I do?

I guess I wanted advice on how to turn her down.

I don't know what open her up means.

I'm back.

Hi.

Hi, Augie.

Shagging Facebook.

Hi, Augie.

I hate Facebook, but I love it.

Do you know what I mean?

Yeah.

Have you ever seen that movie called Brokeback Mountain?

Sure.

You know how he's like- You just said that very quickly, Jason.

Yeah.

Amazing movie.

I saw it opening night.

I just want Augie to feel supported.

I just wanted to point out that we love movies.

I just want Augie to feel supported and that I know exactly the movie that she's talking about.

Anyway, there just was this part where he's like- About Facebook?

Yeah.

He's like, I don't know how to quit you.

And I'm kind of like, that's how I feel about Facebook?

Yes.

Isn't that so- Interesting.

I didn't correlate it to Facebook when I saw it.

Isn't that interesting, Scott?

Isn't that like a funny story that Augie just told?

Look, Augie, it's so odd that you know all these people from high school.

It's not odd?

I meant it's not Aug.

No, it is Aug.

It is.

I mean- No, you are Aug, but I don't remember you from high school.

All these stories that you're telling are unfamiliar to me, although it is very weird that we know the same people.

So I'm assuming, yes, you did go to high school, but- Is this Hollywood or something?

Are you sure you don't have me mistaken for someone else?

Are you big timing her, man?

I'm not big timing her, but- You're totally big timing.

There's people back at home call you Scott Hollywood-Ackerman, and I'm like, no, that's not what it is.

Are you sure?

Hollywood-Ackerman?

Shaw?

Part of Shaw-na-na?

Now that's interesting.

Danny Mahoney, you're- Now that's interesting.

Hot dog is not around.

Is it you that's keeping hot dog out of Shaw-na-na-shaw?

Are you sure you're not mistaking me for Scotch-Ackerman?

Oh, wait, who?

Scotch-Ackerman was, he was the guy- That's what I've been saying.

Doesn't sound like a real person.

I remember sitting- no, no, it's a guy from high school.

That's what I just said, Scotch-Ackerman.

No, I'm Scott-Ackerman.

What the fuck?

Yeah, no, I'm a totally different guy than Scott.

No, Scotch- Scotch?

Yeah, no, no, no.

I've been saying- His first name is Scotch?

Yes.

No, no, no.

His last name is Auckerman?

Auckerman.

Auckerman, and her name's Auckerman.

Do you not know what happened to Scotch?

He's fully grown.

No, no.

Yeah.

No.

Yeah.

Wait, what's your name again?

Scott-Ackerman.

No, Scotch- No.

Scotch became fully grown right out of high school.

Which means he passed away.

I know.

Oh, I didn't know if you knew that.

It's a British term.

Yeah, it's a British term.

No, no.

I have British cousins.

Bob's your uncle.

No, he had a bad case of arsenic poisoning.

Oh, Scotch did?

Scotch did the day after he took out a huge life insurance policy.

Terrible tragedy.

Why are your eyes darting back and forth?

Wait, the day after graduation he died?

The day after graduation, yeah, yeah, yeah.

He was fully grown on my wedding day?

Yeah.

That's maybe why he didn't go.

Yeah.

Oh, this is adding up now.

Oh my God, Scotch, no.

No, Scotch, no.

Scotch, yes.

But you know what this highlights is an obvious- Is that a shirt?

Scotch, yes.

I don't think so.

Okay.

All right.

But what were you going to say, Jason?

I feel like this is heartbreaking for Auggie.

It is.

Thank God you are here to comfort her as someone who does in fact now realize you do know her.

Yes, yes.

Come in close.

Give me a hug, baby.

Did you say baby or maybe?

I said maybe.

You can if you want.

I do want to.

Come close.

Oh, that's a t-shirt.

No, everyone have a piece of pie.

Oh, wait a minute.

Okay, we need to take a break.

Can we have the pie when we get back?

All right.

When we come back, we'll get flippy and floppy with all of whatever you've made here.

Scotch, no.

Oh no.

We need some time to grieve.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Come on.

Comedy bang bang, comedy bang bang.

We are back here.

We have, of course, Jason Manzukas who's checking his phone currently.

The longest hey-oh in the biz.

Scotty.

Yep, there it is.

You can always count on Jason to do a long hey-oh.

We also have Wobbles Eugenia who is here and- Toot toot toot toot.

Toot toot toot toot.

I don't know that it's going to stick.

Great British Baking Show.

Fun.

We also have- And also, now listen.

Now listen.

We have Augie Augerbun who has been just devastated this entire break.

Hi.

She's- You were making some calls.

Her voice is kind of considerably lower.

You were making some calls outside.

Yeah, I was making some calls.

Whom were you calling?

Were you calling your ex-husband or- I do.

I sort of do feel like I need to reconnect with my ex-husband.

I left my husband for Scotch.

For this person you haven't seen in 30 years?

Scotch Augerbun?

Augerbun, yeah.

Scotch.

Why?

Why now?

Why him?

It's just he's never left my mind.

You know those people that like you- He's never left the medulla oblongata?

Not the boner part of my mind.

Oh, okay.

No, that's the- The thalamus.

The thalma.

The thalma and Louise.

He's never- Good chime in.

Thank you.

He's never left that thalma and Louise part of my brain.

It's just something where you think about- you guys all have someone from high school.

Here's the thing I'm going to say, Augie.

Figure out for you how to keep moving forward.

You can't live in the back ward.

You got to live in the forward.

You can't live in that high school love because it probably wasn't even real.

That was decades ago.

It could have been real.

Now that he's dead, we'll never know.

We'll never know.

Well, he's been dead for- you can't say now that he's dead because he's been dead forever.

But now he's dead to me.

Do you know what I mean?

He wasn't dead yesterday.

Sure.

How would you have lived your life differently?

If we had been together?

No, if you knew if he was dead.

By the way, why aren't you checking up on him the day of your wedding and show up and you just assume- I mean, in a way he was dead to me.

Do you know what I mean?

Oh, because, yeah.

So just to be clear, did both of you and a Scotch Augurkerman all date Jamie Layton at the same time?

Yeah, I guess so.

I'm just putting that together.

That's pretty weird too.

I don't want a slut-shamer, but what a slut.

I actually do want a slut-shamer, but I want to do it to her face, so I'm going to wait until I get back to home.

You should reconnect with her.

To home.

Yeah.

Anaheim.

Where are you living now?

Anaheim.

Yeah, yeah.

We live in Anaheim.

Anaheim adjacent.

Yeah, just off the 101.

I live- yeah.

Yeah, what do you do lately?

I'm still riding horses.

Oh, I didn't know you used to.

We don't know each other.

Oh, yeah, that's right.

We were never in the same classes.

No, we probably- wait, were you not in the same classes as Scotch?

No, hold on.

No, Scotch and I were never in the same classes.

Oh.

So you were sitting next to him.

I was always sitting next to Scotch.

We were two peas in a pea pod.

Yeah, you see you guys- Pea in a teacher's cup.

Pea in a teacher's cup.

So how many- Pea in a teacher's cups.

Ba-na-na-na-na.

Pea in a teacher's cups.

Never again.

So you were peeing in a lot of cups.

That's pretty much what we did every day.

You know, it was so interesting.

All of my classes I would wonder because teachers would always start class, they would take a sip and then spit it out.

That's my work, baby.

Wow, you say baby too.

That's my work, baby.

Wait, did you steal baby from Scotch and Augie?

Was that fair to admit?

I have to admit.

I'm going to call the Bobbies.

The babies?

The Bubbies?

The Bobbies.

The Bobbies?

The Jewish grandmothers?

No, I have some British cousins and Bobbies is what they call policemen.

Oh.

Like time Bobbies.

Yeah.

So, okay, yeah, I'm sorry I'm not who you were thinking of, but do you like what you see?

Actually, no.

Oh.

So you were disappointed when you came in here.

Well, I just figured like everybody ages, you know what I mean?

Wait, do you think I've aged?

Like, do I look really terrible?

Oh, buddy, I think you've aged.

I know, but I have aged.

I've only known you like 10 years.

I mean, like, do you remember what Scotch looked like?

Yeah, I mean, he was- Do you remember what he looked like without his shirt on?

No, I don't.

Okay, well, the kumgutters were kicking.

Yeah.

As were his dads, as were his moms and his brothers and his sisters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, the Augermans had amazing kumgutters.

And that wasn't why I loved him, but it was part of him.

They had a calendar every year, didn't they?

Yes.

Like every month was a different member of the family's kumgutters.

Oh my God.

By the way, that's a- That's a CBB idea.

Yeah, comedians with their shirts off.

Comedians with kumgutters.

Yeah.

Yeah, we'll definitely sell a lot of those.

Comedians with kumgutters in cars.

And it's just Jerry Seinfeld every month.

Yeah, just him taking off his shirt.

Just really, really good.

Like a crazy fucking CrossFit bod on Seinfeld.

I'm so sorry that he's gone, but now you can finally move on with your life.

It seems like you were dissatisfied with your relationship.

Yeah, things weren't going well.

Really?

What do you mean by that?

I mean, we just were, we weren't really two peas in a pea pod.

Do you know what I mean?

You're peeing in people's cups.

Good.

No, but it's like- You shouldn't pee.

But don't you want somebody that you can go through life that is down to pee in people's cups with you?

Sure, I guess you want someone who's down, but you don't actually want to do it.

You know, I would hope that after high school you put aside those childish things.

Okay, well hope gets you so far.

So you didn't.

You still pee in people's- That's my catchphrase.

Okay.

I don't know.

I do know.

I just told you.

No, I mean, I don't know if I like it.

Okay, well I do know that that's my catchphrase.

Okay, great.

All right.

I don't know why we're fighting.

I was about to say we always used to fight, but then I just remembered you're not Scotch firemen.

So you don't like this?

I mean, you're referring to yourself, your body, your hair, your- You just earlier were saying you were married, happily married.

Well look, I want to be wanted.

Listen, if you're willing- It was very flattering.

If you're willing to go with Augie, go with Augie.

You'll pay for it?

Don't make her give you compliments if you have no interest.

She's grieving.

I'm fishing, baby.

I want some nibs.

You want some nibs?

I guess so.

I want some nibs.

No, I- You want some nibs.

How many nibs do you want?

Like a bunch of dog nips on your- No, nibs, nibbles.

Like eight different nibs on your chest?

My dog has more than eight.

Really?

God.

Is that bad?

Move over, bacon.

Now listen, who wants a slice of apple pie?

Oh, I would love some.

Let's serve it up.

This is the flattest pie I've ever seen.

Are you so excited to have it?

Now listen.

Yeah, okay.

Oh, she said it.

She said it.

Before I give you this slice of flat pie, I need you all to pull up Northwestern Mutual and I need you all to talk to an agent.

Talk to an agent?

You have to pull up the website and talk to an agent?

Like chat, sort of?

Yes.

And I need you to start your life insurance policy before you get on the such- Okay.

All right, here I am.

Okay.

Agent.

No.

Agent.

No.

Hello?

Representative.

Oh, hi.

Hello?

Wait, is this for all of us?

Oh, you guys, I got her.

I got an agent.

Oh, is it for all of us or for just you, Augie?

It's probably fine if it's for all of us.

I bet each one of us is going to have to talk to a different agent.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

So, Augie, you just talk to this.

Okay.

Hi, I'm Northwestern Mutual.

Hey.

Oh, I was just- You are Northwestern Mutual.

Yeah, I'm Northwestern Mutual.

How can I help you?

Cool.

I'm Northwestern Mutual.

Sign sealed and delivered.

Hold on one second.

Sorry.

What's your name again?

Jen.

Oh, I thought it was Northwestern.

No, no, no.

I'm Northwestern Mutual.

My name is Jen.

Okay.

Jen, do you mind holding for a second?

No.

You don't mind?

Hey, Jason.

What's that?

It's going pretty well.

Is it going good?

Yeah, I thought it was going to be scary, but it's not.

Is the person friendly on the phone?

She was.

Sounds to me like it's sign sealed delivered.

You have a problem with it.

Did you do it?

Oh, are we done?

Wait, can we hear it?

Yeah, Jen hung up.

Oh, my God.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.

Can we hear it?

Yeah.
