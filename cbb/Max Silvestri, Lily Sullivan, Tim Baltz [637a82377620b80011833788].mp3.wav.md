♪♪♪ The Sidewinder sleeps tonight unlike other nights when the Sidewinder just does Molly and gets fucking nuts. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

♪♪♪ Yes, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. We are back if you can believe it.

No less week was it our final episode. We came back. We decided to do one more at least.

So, welcome back. Happy Navi Doggute, my name is Scott Ockermann.

We have a great show.

Coming up a little later, we have a doctor, a physician, one might say.

We also have a citizen of a certain town that they live in.

As are we all?

As they would say in Battle of Sargolaxica. But before we get to them, we want to get to our guest of honor.

By the way, this is the show Humanities Podcast. It used to be the show where we talked to interesting people.

Now it's Humanities Podcast. Might expand to Humanities and the Animal Kingdoms Podcast. We're not sure.

We're testing it out on animals. We're doing animal testing right now.

And putting lipstick on them, mascara, and blasting Comedy Bang Bang right in their ears.

So far they don't like it. I don't know whether it's the mascara.

The content of the show, the volume. Not quite sure what it is at this point, but we'll figure that out.

Let's get to our guest of honor. I want to say two and a half years ago, he appeared at a comedy festival in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Did a 10 minute set opening for Dave Kool-Yay.

Dave Kool-Yay that rocked the entertainment world.

Thanks then. The floodgates have opened and show business has become available to him.

He is out there and to choose your own adventure book of show business.

Do I want to do this project? Do I want to do this project?

He has settled on a scripted podcast from Audible by the name of Past.

And we'll find out whether it's spelled P-A-S-S-E-D or P-A-S-T.

My bedtime.

That is out right now.

Boy, because one of our favorites, please welcome back to the show Max Sylvester.

Hello Max. Hello Scott, it's so nice to be back talking about that festival appearance.

Was that the last live comedy show you did?

Before? Yeah, because we talked about it on this show. We did a full episode before.

It was a festival appearance. Before, just to hype it up and to make sure people went to it.

Yeah, and then about a year after, we kind of did a like wrap up.

Let's collect our thoughts. We've had a little distance to let it marinate the spices that have gotten in.

Yeah, exactly. And now I... Did we do one since then too? I feel like we did another one where we got a second wrap.

Oh yeah, maybe this is the fourth time talking about the 11th annual...

We try to add you on once a year just so we can talk about this 10 minutes set you did.

Yeah, and you're right, since I did that set now almost four years ago, I wouldn't say doors have been unlocked, but it's as if they're not open, they're not unlocked, but they're there.

Yes, it's as if I've opened a mailbox and gotten a piece of paper that has like a drawing of where doors are.

Yes.

And I wasn't able to keep the drawing, but I did get a good look at it for about a minute.

Someone confiscated the drawing.

Yeah, the person whose house it was came out and said you can't have that.

When you open the mail at someone else's house, you can just do that. Most mailboxes don't lock.

It's really just kind of a system of trust and fear of punishment.

Mr. Do you think society is different now? I mean, it used to be used to not have to put a lock on your mailbox, and now I see a lock on, you know, out of 10 mailboxes?

Nine?

I know. People don't trust their neighbors anymore.

People don't trust their neighbor. That's a great way of putting it.

Because they don't go to a Christian church. That's mostly what I'm talking about here today.

Also building community around faith.

So things have changed since the last time you were running.

Quite a bit. I met a lot of new people in Nebraska.

Catch us up though really briefly that 10 minutes, sure. It was for a festival.

It was for a festival in Johnny Carson's honor.

You had to go on a tour of Johnny Carson's house.

It was in his hometown, and I was forced to do a tour of his home, which has been completely remodeled.

And then watch a video about the remodeling of the house.

That doesn't seem to have factored into Johnny Carson's life at all.

I agree. I don't feel that he had a lot of input in how this festival was put together, nor the memorial to his home. And then, yeah, I did a 10 minute set, and then the next.

Did Dave Kool-Yay watch the set? Did we talk about that aspect of it?

Did he give you a great job, kid, in a Popeye voice or anything after that?

I wish. You would have heard about it in one of the three previous recaps had he done that, but instead he was dressed in an incredibly expensive outfit, and then he changed into loose-fitting regular guy clothes and a hockey jersey before he went on stage in a reel.

But I mean, he had his finger on the pulse so hard.

Now, most performers do the opposite.

Exactly. They arrive in the hockey outfit and they go, I got to dress up, put on this pulse-smith suit or whatever.

Instead, he took off his beautiful, expensive lounge wear and put on a giant like Nebraska hockey jersey.

See, if I were that rich, because I'm presuming he's rich.

I, you know, that many episodes of Full House...

The reboot? And the reboot? Yeah. Not to mention the reboot.

I would assume, if I were that rich, I would not dress up a day in my life.

I'd be like, you come to me. You dress up for me.

I'm exactly with you. I'd be like, what I'm wearing right now is what the right rich thing to do is, because if I get rich, I'm going to assume that every decision I've ever made leading to that point was the correct one, and everyone who doesn't also make those decisions are scum and should be washed like trash down into the gutters.

So, but yeah, he understands that he's still an entertainer because ultimately he walked on stage and gave the audience exactly what they wanted.

Unlike, I would say that I did not bring an attitude that they felt like seeing.

They wanted to hear stories about Full House as we've talked about.

Oh, that just took us to this podcast.

Did you have any stories about Full House that you told in your 10 minutes head?

I didn't, and that was one of my biggest things.

10 minutes is a long time when you think about it.

Like, if you tried to tell, if you had no jokes, like, and Max, you're one of America's greatest comedians.

Thank you for saying that.

You have jokes. But say you had no jokes?

No jokes? Yeah.

10 minutes is too long. I, yeah, I feel like to just stand up and talk.

Yeah.

And to speak any truth or extemporate any honest feelings, I couldn't certainly do it, you know?

Yeah.

So it doesn't sound like a long time in order to fit in Full House stories.

It was tough.

And they had also not told me to prepare any Full House stories.

I was sort of like, they were like, we want you to do comedy, and I guess I assumed, and this was my mistake, that I'm still sort of getting my hands around that what they meant was, do the thing, like do normally, normally do.

And that was wrong.

That was wrong.

What you should have done was tell stories about you watching Full House or you are ideally behind the scenes stuff of what it was like to do pranks with Bob Sagitt 24 years ago.

And I just, I personally chose to not do that on stage.

And honestly for the best because Dave Cooley covered a lot of that.

And I feel like it would have been rude to that.

What if you scooped it though?

And just told, it's always funny when you see like a comedian open for someone and then the second comedian gets mad because it's like, I had that joke too.

You know, it's like, I pick on the guy with the big jacket.

Yeah.

Have you, have you seen that where the headliner and you headline sometimes for like John Mulaney?

Sure.

Yeah.

Has he said like, okay, here are the five people in the front row.

You're, you're not allowed to talk to because they're there for me.

I've never, he's never done that.

He wouldn't do that.

He's not worried about that.

But I have had been in situations at clubs or whatever where they're like, this years ago where they'll say like, and don't do any crowd work.

Like that's any like get up there, do exactly 12 minutes.

And then, you know, the headliner is the one that's allowed to josh around.

Yeah.

Exactly.

Well, uh, you were allowed to josh around on that fateful night in Lincoln, Nebraska.

And it's led you here.

Let's talk about this podcast.

Please.

The main world scripted podcast, which means for the layperson, what?

Basically, it means in the way that a podcast like this feels organic and exciting.

That way, even though we planned out a lot of course every beat, we're all looking at a big whiteboard right now that kind of has like a flow chart of three X structure.

Exactly.

Scripted podcast is sort of like more feels more like a TV show that you can't see.

Mmm.

Now, was that good?

Because when my TV is broken and the picture's out, I'm upset.

But this is a good thing.

Like in an act like you like in a rage way.

Yeah.

I have emotional problems at home.

So you're you're screaming and like you don't know where to direct it.

And that's fine.

And then the TV thing happens.

Oh man.

It's everybody tips going around Scott at home.

I'll be this here tonight.

We'll see.

I grew up.

Driving near a drive in theater that we had and I wouldn't pay and I would put the radio on the whole.

Hold on a second.

You grew up driving near a drive in.

Well, there are.

What a strange upbringing you had.

But you just drove around this drive in theater all the time.

I was bringing up the story because it felt unusual and unique that you haven't experienced it is exactly why I brought it up.

So let me see.

Would you like me to bring up?

This is the Dave Kool-Yay thing all over again.

Let Dave Kool-Yay talk about the house.

You wake up in the morning eight a.m.

Your parents say let's take a drive around the drive.

Yeah, I'm 12 years old.

I go for the case.

They say fine.

I drive.

You drive them.

This is getting even weird.

No, they're in the house.

They're having breakfast.

They've lost me two years ago.

And you're telling the house?

No, we're speaking in the houses where the keys are kept.

The way I grew up, keys were in the house.

Keys were in the house.

Okay, we kept them in the backyard.

Yeah, okay.

That's a totally reasonable way to do it.

But we're from different worlds.

And get in the car, open the garage.

I'm not going to walk you through every step.

But I then drive near.

So the lights are out.

I'm presuming.

You're fumbling around for the car.

I would slap the garage door opener and the garage door.

I'm not in a glig.

I'm in a glig.

Okay.

And you know, the light in the garage.

It was fair.

So the way that I was able to find objects in space.

You just leave this garage door open after you leave.

So the way I'm able to find objects in space.

Are thieves going into your house and stealing everything?

That's where my parents to handle.

I'm not there.

I'm near a movie theater, a drive-in movie theater at this point.

But I would put the radio on and you could get the drive-in movie theater station.

Yeah.

And it's like experiencing a movie without having to look at anything.

You'll get other stuff.

You don't have to pay.

That's kind of what this podcast.

So you're listening to Van Helsing.

Exactly.

Yes.

The movie Dragonheart starring Dennis Quaid is a specific example that I remember where I didn't realize I was near a movie theater.

Thought I'd found a radio station that played audio dramatizations of popular movies that were in theaters maybe two months earlier.

Exactly.

And I was sort of into it because Dennis Quaid has got star power.

I could tell what movie it was.

But then there was just sort of a long period of grumbling and foley noises and leaves crunching and then the growl.

And I was like, oh, they're not really telling the story.

Did it give you an appreciation for those foley artists?

Because they do a lot.

See this is the thing.

You don't know.

Anytime you hear anything in a movie other than dialogue, it's a foley artist having to recreate it.

It's crazy to people.

So step footsteps.

Yeah.

Doors creaking.

People, like someone touching someone on the shoulder, they'll put in like, you know, kind of one of those noises.

Because mics can't pick that stuff up on a set.

No, they can't.

It's actually, I highly recommend people watch the Dune trailer, the original Dune trailer because there is a one little scene lit in this trailer where Jason Momoa is talking to Timothy Chalamet.

So the original Dune trailer.

Well, the first trailer for the most recent Dune movie.

So you'll be sorting on the Warner Brothers.

So the original trailer of the Reese.

Okay.

Or the Reese.

So how are we supposed to know which one's the original?

It'll say trailer number one.

Okay.

So Jason Momoa touched the Chalamet on the arm in kind of an improvised way six times in the middle of your life.

And you hear the Foley artist go, oh shit.

Yeah.

And it's too late.

And it's all in the trailer because it would have not made sense.

And it's just amazing what Foley artists do.

Incredible.

So you grow up in this strange town.

Yes.

And you listened to this stuff and then you said, okay, then we have the detour into the ten minutes at.

Yep.

And then you were like, okay, what can I do with this art form?

So what does Max Sylvester do with a scripted audio podcast?

Well, I wrote it along with my wife who I live with.

We weren't married when we started and we were married by the end of it.

Really?

So was that part of it where suddenly did you type out, will you marry me?

Oh, and read page 69, dear.

I've got a rewrite.

I think you're going to like, I have a new idea for an episode.

It's a love story.

Well, I just feel like it's kind of a very modern, but already classic test of a relationship of like, okay, can you live a podcast together?

Can you go on the case together?

Can you write a scripted original together and produce it and do all the scripts?

And as soon as we kind of were in post production, we looked at each other and we're like, I just work.

I think we can, yeah.

I mean, what is having a baby, if not giving birth to a podcast?

Exactly.

Yeah, it just hits different.

It does hit different.

And it was really cool how a bunch of the speeches at our wedding, including the ceremony mentioned that we'd done a podcast together.

I felt like it was just sort of this timeless romantic moment that it was wonderful to experience then.

And I know I'll look back being so happy that that was called out.

It's never going to seem like it was of that moment.

No, particular year.

And the podcast wasn't out yet.

So it was more just even the idea that we'd written and produced the podcast with no release date at the moment of our ceremony.

Well, that's wonderful.

What is your writing process like?

Every other word or what is it like?

One line.

Mm, line at a time.

Yep.

And then we take a walk together, okay?

And then we come back.

We will eat, you know, not a full meal, like, snacks, figs, cheese, you know, that sort of classic snacks.

Whatever you can pluck or whatever is just on hand.

And we, huge screen fight, never about the line, but it's obviously about the line.

Right.

But it's about some little thing of just like, you know, why don't you mention that, you know, stuff like that, right?

Things around the house.

This is how you do a dishwasher.

And then we make love.

Sure.

The fight, of course.

And then we look at the line again and we do another pass at it and it all starts over.

And it's just from there.

It's just brick by brick.

Yeah.

So that line, how many times does that line get rewritten?

Uh, it's interesting when you read a script.

And this is a glimpse inside the writer's process because I've written a few in my day, of course, if you're reading any script, it is, it is crazy how many times the first page has been rewritten over and over and how few times the last page has, it's like, the first page has probably been rewritten 250 times.

And the last page may be once.

That is, that is exactly the energy of what we, we, we belabored the first half so intensely, can we make everything perfect?

And then we finished the rest on time.

That's, that's the story of the last fours that got turned in.

But really any piece of entertainment, the last few episodes of anything are just shit, right?

Absolutely.

I mean, maybe movies.

Like look at Game of Thrones.

Game of Thrones.

Everyone complains about the last season.

It was just because they had a deadline.

Yeah.

They're tired.

Yeah.

They're tired.

Let some people sleep.

They've been working so hard on the first five seasons.

Then the sixth one, they're just like, okay, we gotta turn this in.

I mean, exactly people are tired.

It's kind of like the title of our scripted Audible Original.

It's past my bedtime.

You know, let me go to wonder bed.

Past my bedtime is the podcast.

It is on Audible, which when I was growing up, Audible was just a company that, where you could listen to books like the Harry Potter book.

Yeah.

By that notorious turf, JK Rowling.

And now they have expanded into making podcasts.

Tell us what past my bedtime is.

Sure.

It is the little subheading is the untold, it is an oral history of the fastest failure in late night history.

It is narrated by journalists, played by David Harbor of Stranger Things.

Hellboy!

Yeah.

Not the first Hellboy.

No.

The original Hellboy.

As you would put it.

Watch the first trailer for the newest Hellboy.

And I think you'll have an idea of what David Harbor is.

But it's about a late night show in 2003 that was hosted by a 10 year old boy and was canceled six minutes into the live premiere.

Is this a true story or is this something that you just...

This is the mud.

We want to muck around in.

This is the tension we're playing with here that you're asking is exactly the conversation we want to be having.

But it is fake.

It's cast of actors and it's all actors and they do characters and it's like silly and there's fun.

Yeah, it's fun.

Who's it?

Because I saw a cast list, not like those cast lists, you know, when you're in high school drama where you try out for the play and they post it to a door and they think it wasn't like that.

That would have broken my heart if you'd gone looking in person somewhere.

It's not even out.

We're down to the local high school to see if I could see the cast list of this.

If you go to the sag building or whatever, they just put all these things up.

I'll cast list for every...

And I will say the crowd of people huddling to look at what's posted is a real bummer.

Everyone crying.

It's dark energy.

The line for the bus after sucks.

But it is David Harbour, Whoopi Goldberg, Zach Alfonakis.

A lot of CBB faves.

Really?

Got Lennon, Harms in it.

Is this some sort of a big mouth by Nick Kroll's situation where Paul F. Tomkins and I are alluded to in it but we don't have parts?

In that show we're drawn into the show.

That's funny you say that because there's actually two writer-comedian actor characters that are named Scott and Paul.

Of course.

And there's such a big part of it and it was such a struggle to cast them.

Wait, are they pedophiles in the show?

Because I don't want to play that.

I'm okay with that.

It's an amazing cast.

How long are these episodes?

It's 10, 30 minute episodes and it starts as...

300 minutes total.

A little more than that.

It's on the... almost 320 minutes.

320 minutes.

Yeah.

Okay.

And they're all out and if you have an honorable plus, it starts as a story of behind the scenes of this late night show but it becomes sort of a search for where the boy is now and kind of a bigger conspiracy theory.

It becomes a bit of a mystery.

Okay.

And is it solved by the end or does it just...

Well, it's...

No, it does.

It's solved by the end.

It's got a really satisfying ending.

It's not...

So it doesn't just stop in the middle of an episode.

I mean, while we were writing it, we would have loved to do exactly that.

There's a new concept.

What if it just ends?

What if we just stop releasing it?

10 minutes into episode six, it just ends.

But we still get all the money we talked about.

Yeah.

How about that?

Well, that's fantastic.

I'm really anticipating and looking forward to listening to the fruits of your wife and your labor.

Sure.

Metaphorically.

Oh, yeah.

Literally.

If you were to ever have sex and have a baby, I would listen to them.

Oh, yeah.

I mean, hopefully we'll get them into the podcast space early.

I mean, that's the thing.

It's embarrassing to you to say podcast instead of podcast.

I am already texting everyone in this room.

Please take that out.

I'm flipping out.

I can't believe it.

Unfortunately, our editing machine is broken.

I haven't been working on the editing machine for years at this point.

And I think there's something where it's stuck or something, but he can't like, you know, he's put a knife in there and even when it's plugged in and he got electrocuted one day.

But when I did all the like ironic slur stuff at the beginning when we were just sitting down, oh, we weren't rolling.

Oh my God.

Okay.

No, you walked into it.

Sure.

Yeah.

I mean, all the stuff on my t-shirt.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Pass my bedtime.

What do people do?

Just put those words into a search bar or something and yeah, go to audible.com.

Any search bar.

Any search bar, really?

I mean, really any bar, just say the name pass my bedtime.

You're going to get a bartender with a phone.

He can look it up.

Look at where you live.

Get you a new copy of it to your house.

Yeah.

Well, wonderful.

It's out there on audible.

People should be listening to this approximately 320 minutes.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we have a physician and we have a citizen of a town.

How excited are you to stick around?

We're going to be right back.

We have more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back.

Max Sylvester.

Past my bedtime is the scripted podcast.

While we don't suggest you listen to any other podcast other than comedy bang bang, unless there's an emergency, that is out there.

And one can listen to it if they choose to, but we do not suggest that they do so.

It would mean a lot to my wife, Leah Beckman and I.

The only way our marriage survives is if we average a 4.7 rating audible after six months.

That's kind of built into the vows.

I know.

With the podcast ratings being what they are and slipping the way they live.

And the trolls?

Oh, the trolls.

The trolls.

So, yeah, it's the only way our marriage.

And I love her with all my heart.

So I need this to work.

I've put so much of my youth.

Do you have to do a podcast a year with her just to like keep everything the juice and headache and keep it.

Yeah, I think we might just write more episodes of this one, not put them out, but just to kind of like capture that magic.

Yeah.

Okay, great.

We need to get to our next guest.

He is a physician.

Do you have a physician?

Max, I've seen one before.

I don't have one.

You don't have a personal relationship with a physician.

No, every time something's wrong with me, I start from zero.

I have someone new.

I have to, I don't know where the website is.

I don't know who's going to be bored.

Well, you're young enough that nothing's going on yet.

I don't know.

Things are piling up.

I really should develop some relationships.

Really?

What do you got?

I don't, just things are always like hurting.

And I feel like my teeth are going to start to fall out soon.

You really should see someone.

I should.

Do you have a regular physician?

I do, yes.

In several areas, yes.

Which areas?

Of your body?

Of the body, yeah.

Of the body physician.

And then, and then little parts of the body, they go like, oh, well, I'm only going to talk to you about this one.

I'm, you know, it's a racket because like one doctor doesn't want to learn about all the parts.

Yeah, that's the thing.

Like you would think that your doctor would know everything about everything because he's everything.

Yeah.

But then he's like, oh, okay, something wrong with your foot.

I didn't do that chapter in school.

Yeah.

These people are idiots.

Anyway, let's talk to one.

He speaking of foot doctor, he is a podiatrist.

He, Fancies and Styles himself as a celebrity podiatrist, please welcome to the show Harry Footman.

Thank you very much, Scott.

What's up, your voice?

Honor to be here.

What's up?

That's your voice?

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

I'm sorry.

I was just thrown.

Unbelievable.

Is this your voice?

Are you putting on an affect?

I pray to God at night.

I get down on my knees right in front of my bed and I pray to God.

Scott is putting on an accent.

That's not his real voice.

It's disgusting.

It grates in my ears.

Anyway, oh, I'm sorry.

Is this the first podcast you've ever done?

Because you've never heard your voice back.

You wouldn't know that it's extreme.

You know that word extreme, like sports and certain sodas.

Politics.

Yeah.

Ideological views.

It's just, it's very different.

I apologize.

I don't mean to set you back on your heels immediately.

Yeah.

Well, wait.

That's the way you say yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Listen, we're learning a lot about you.

Yeah.

Well, if you want me to do a character voice.

I don't want you to do anything.

I just want you to be yourself.

Definitely, because when I come out when I listen, you know, I'm not just your podiatrist.

You are a celebrity.

I'm also a huge fan of the show.

I didn't want it.

Because of HIPAA laws, I didn't want you to reveal that you were my.

But yes, you are my.

Because every time I'm looking at your feet, I'm like these are the feet that create comedy.

Bang, bang.

Oh, and I've never heard your voice before because you're always looking down at the feet and so it's always going into the floor.

Right.

This is the first time I'm actually hearing you.

I use text to talk when I'm in the office because I don't want to upset people with my cadence.

Yeah.

But you know, every time I'm listening to podcasts, I'm like, can be Scott Ocherman.

You know, give me interesting characters.

Give me hard hitting interviews with the Maserbik tone.

Perfection.

Yeah.

Welcome to the show.

Really?

Yeah.

What?

I mean that genuinely.

I mean, I'm honored to be here despite all the abuse I've already taken.

I don't think it's abuse.

I was thrown.

I apologize.

I don't mean to make you feel that way.

It's all right.

I've got an angelic face.

Everyone assumes that I'd have some kind of dulcet tone.

It is.

You look very cherubic.

Thank you.

Yes.

I've got nice big cheeks.

Chubby cheeks, one might say.

Yeah.

Chubby little Gerber cheeks.

I mostly baby.

Steve Gerber jeans.

Steve Gerber.

What an icon.

Yeah.

What an incredible man.

Used to be a baby.

And now a lot of people don't know.

He was the Gerber baby.

Yeah.

And he grows up and what is he?

He's like, oh, I'm sorry.

Does Cindy Crawford is that who I'm thinking of?

Yeah.

It's not.

Who you're thinking?

Oh, who am I thinking?

Randy Gerber.

Same guy.

Yeah.

The other guy changed his name.

He used to be Steve Gerber.

Now he's Randy Gerber.

What is his story?

Has sexual Cindy Crawford.

Yeah.

We're talking about the same guy.

Welcome to the show.

So you're a celebrity podiatrist.

I'm a podiatrist for celebrity.

You're not a celebrity who does podiatry.

No, I'm not very well known at all.

But after this episode, maybe.

Yeah.

Scott's giving you quite a platform.

I mean, this seems really nice.

Yeah.

I mean, that festival in Lincoln, Nebraska, the most advertising they've ever received is your four appearances here.

And that's why the whole world now knows the name of that festival, which even I could say if I wanted to.

Sure.

If we wanted to, we have no desire.

Yeah.

I mean, he said it so many times.

And obviously I know what it is.

I'm tired of saying it at this point.

I thought if you did said Scott would cut it out.

He didn't.

That's a Dave Coolier joke.

Oh, thank you so much.

He would edit it out of the podcast.

He wouldn't want people to know.

They've had enough advertising.

Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

And that name Harry Footman.

Yeah.

What?

Is that a, is that like, you know, it's not a stage name when you're a doctor, right?

It's not a nom de plume.

That's when you're a writer.

What is it for a doctor when you take a fake name?

Yeah, yeah.

Great question.

So, I mean, my parents named me Harold Footman.

Their last name was Footman.

Oh.

People used to say Harry Footman.

You know, they called me Harry Footman.

And so I think it was just the universe kind of pointing me to the dietary.

Also a major foot fetishist.

Oh, oh, really?

Yeah.

Is that like a conflict of interest to be examined and people?

I don't think there's anything in the rule book about it, is it?

I mean, like, you're right.

You know what I mean?

It's like, I guess that's question you could at like you go to your gynecologist.

And you're like, do you love this?

Yeah, you don't love this.

And it's like you love podcasting.

It was not like a crime that you get to do the thing that gets you visibly arrested for two hours every week.

As they say, do whatever you love and you whatever the rest.

Yeah.

How were the rest goes?

You paid to do what you love and you never worked a day in your life.

So Scott, back to when you were saying when you go to your gynecologist and you're asking them questions.

Yeah.

Uh huh.

Like, do I have a vagina?

This is not what they're.

So stop making appointments with me.

This is a penis and balls.

The reason you can't remember the last time you've had your peer.

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Yeah.

Perfect.

So you have, but you have a foot fetish.

That's interesting.

Yeah.

So you, and you've had that ever since you were young or?

Uh, yes.

I've always been, yes, I've always been seduced and attracted to a beautiful foot, you know, and all of that.

What makes a foot beautiful?

Because I look at these things and I'm just like, disgusting.

Yeah, disgusting.

I don't think people should be allowed to wear sandals.

Like, is there an idyllic foot?

Like a perfect foot?

Yeah, absolutely.

Uh, probably the ideal foot is a woman's 12 and a half, a man's 13 and a half.

Uh, Claude Toast.

Claude.

Claude Toast.

That's a condition planner for shi-do.

It's a condition that, that it means something's wrong with him, but that's a perfect foot to you.

Yeah.

To me, everyone has a different definition of a beautiful.

So you see beauty in like decay and like kind of you find, uh, and dariously abnormally large feet as well.

Right, yeah, yeah.

So like Scott's foot, for example, Scott's foot is like, you know, it looks like a possum that's been a half-shave.

Oh, I'm kind of comfortable with you talking about how my feet actually look.

But go on.

Well, honestly, thank you for the platform.

Which half has been changed?

The bottom half.

Thank goodness.

Um, but Max, you were, you were alluding to this earlier in Scott.

You, you know, said the same thing.

You have such a huge platform.

You know, I hope my podiatry business gets the boom, boom, boom.

Um, but, um, but, uh, no, no, no, I'm being serious.

So, um, what I mean to say is I came, I came on the show to make a confession.

A confession.

Oh, okay.

Well, uh, to a, to a crime or not, maybe a crime of passion.

I've been secretly taking pictures of all the celebrities' feet and putting them on wiki feet over the years.

You're the wiki feet doctor?

I knew they had a source.

There was too much stuff they had access to.

Ooh.

Much.

You're the guy.

I'm the guy.

No.

Yeah.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

How did your patience not know?

Because I feel like a lot of those photos have like a, a quarter or a dollar bill next to the feet for scale.

And I'm like, how are people walking barefoot next to money and not picking it up?

And how do you have so many quarters?

Like anytime I, there's a parking meter that doesn't take credit cards now.

It's like, Jesus Christ.

And you have all these quarters just laying around?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

My secret is I go to the bank and I say, can you break this into crayons?

Great.

It's not the confession.

Right.

That's how you get the quarters.

That's my confession.

That's my time.

Thank you.

Stand up.

Reference.

They've cut it out.

I'm not going to get a lot of it.

I've got to get a lot of it.

I'm not going to get a lot of it.

You've already won me over.

You have beautiful voice.

Thank you.

Smooth like silk, rich like chocolate.

Those are the two things when those can combine.

Silk and chocolate.

I mean, diamond and silk.

Even better.

But some silk and chocolate.

Amazing.

Silk and chocolate.

My mouth is open, diamond and silk.

My ears.

In your mind.

In my mind.

In my mind's eye.

Anyway, so you're the guy.

You've been uploading them.

Well, I've never had any complaints because usually celebrities' feet are beautiful.

They take care of them.

Everyone's always like five out of five.

Beautiful feet.

Love the arches.

I suck on that nail bed, etc.

We know the kind of things.

Yeah.

You know this.

You go on wiki.

Are you the one also leaving comments?

Yeah.

But I kind of outed myself recently because.

Just how?

Yeah.

I'll few seconds ago.

I uploaded pictures of Scott's feet and then that's when not just myself but all these other people started commenting.

This is disgusting.

What?

I can smell it through my computer.

No.

Really?

PU situation.

And so I felt bad.

And even though I'm a foot fetishist and a podiatrist and we're notoriously soulless people.

What?

I haven't heard that.

Is that a foot joke?

I get it.

Absolutely.

I haven't heard that about doctors.

Do you mean doctors or podiatrists?

No, just podiatrists.

Really?

Yeah.

The most trustworthy doctors are probably urologists because they're just.

What?

I've never met one who's not a weirdo.

A urologist?

Yeah.

Well, they're all very strange people.

Ooh.

I've gone to two in my life and both of them bizarre.

You're sure it wasn't just someone trying to get your pants off saying they were urologists?

Yeah, pretty sure.

Because that was successful both times.

Because that would work.

Yeah.

That's true.

Great news, Mr. Ockman.

You do not have a UTI.

Yeah, but um.

So you think they're the most trusted and then podiatrists are the least?

Is it because of the quality of the thing they studied?

Like okay, like if you were to say, okay, Max, I'm going to chop something off of your body.

What's the thing you don't want me to chop off and what's the thing you wouldn't mind me chopping off?

Oof.

I mean, I wouldn't want to lose my thumb or my nose.

Those are tied for tops.

I could lose my pinky toes.

Like they were nothing.

I mean, sometimes I'll see maybe a shoe online that is not in my size.

I would lose the toe if it meant fitting into a.

And this is kind of my thing.

I, you know, most people would say, hey, stay away from the Johnson.

But that's the middle of the road for you.

Yeah.

I'd say like if they're, I'm guessing, if they say there's 20 body parts, I'm not going to try to think of them.

But let's say there are famously just 20 body parts.

That you could take off the main, which is what I call the towards.

Sometimes you're horny on me.

But yeah, I would, I would put kind of like where the penis is kind of right in the middle.

That's where I would put it.

Well, you, yeah, you've been going down from the top of the body in terms of your preference too.

I guess I'm like a head in the clouds.

Yeah.

Yours knows the exactly.

Are you the guy outside with the car that has the bumper sticker that says go ahead and chop off my Johnson?

Is that you?

Because I saw that Prius-titted windows.

Gotta have them too.

It's okay.

So, but you played it.

You put a Tesla sticker on it.

Even though it's a Prius.

It's very weird.

It's H8 J H N S N hate Johnson, but then the kind of rim around it says go ahead, chop off my Johnson.

I would love to lose it.

Not only do I not need it, I would love to see it gone.

Right.

I mean, you can start reading that phrase in any, you know, because it's a circle.

So yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

So, but that's my point, Harry, is that, is that.

That's my father.

Call me Mr. Footman.

Okay, Mr. Footman.

Dr. Footman.

I didn't mean to.

I disrespect my father.

Yeah.

But most people would say Johnson.

So like it's like, oh, if you're a doctor to this trusted thing that I'd never want chopped off, I trust them.

But meanwhile, you could chop off my foot and I'd be fine with it.

And you're the doctor of that kind of stuff.

Yeah.

Well, I think it's great to refer to your Johnson as my trusted thing.

I'm about, oh, I'm about to pull out my trusted thing.

You're getting my trusted thing.

Or am I announcing I'm pulling this out too.

I'm, if I'm pulling it out, there's no one in the room.

Right.

Or I'm not announcing it.

You're in a urinal pissing into some ice.

Some use my trusted thing.

The guy who lays down the ice, by the way, my favorite restaurant.

D'Domeo.

Yeah, I've talked to you.

Yeah.

You're satisfying than taking your trusted thing out.

I'm not announcing this in the bathroom, by the way.

Although I may start, hey, everyone, just so there's no confusion.

Yeah.

And I don't get, you know, me too, here.

I'm about to pull out my trusted thing.

Yeah, that's what enthusiastic consent is.

Is it OK if I pull out my trusted thing and absolutely pressure watch this ice?

You need to get consent from a store in the restroom.

I think that's important.

Yeah.

All I need to have sex is a smile.

It is important.

I think I brought this up before.

The public restroom is one of the only places in the world that you can pull out your penis and handle it.

Here we go.

We're in public.

Yeah.

Bluff king.

It is a weird thing to think about.

You're about to do 10 minutes in Nebraska.

And then they don't let you do it in a strip club.

That's the place it should be legal.

Yeah, where are these rules written down?

There's no rollback for this stuff anymore.

How come the customers can't strip as well?

Let me have a bun statement.

You're giving me a laugh, Dan.

It's my turn.

Yeah.

You're just trying to be generous.

You're trying to give back.

I think that's being a good customer.

Yeah.

So we've touched on a lot of different fetishes.

I think it's fine that mine are feet.

Sure.

I guess so.

I mean, hashtag feet.

How do you reconcile your love of disgusting, twisted mutant feet with what I imagine celebrities want, which is kind of a more normative, smooth, long, straight-toed look.

Like do you give them what they want?

Or do you try to sell them on your vision of repulsive beauty?

That's a great question.

I'm not being reproachful at all.

But let's be mindful of our language, normative.

What is normal?

Scott has absolutely hideous feet to normative eyes.

I don't like telling everyone that.

You know?

And they asked you to do something about it.

Literally point a snout into one big toe at the end of it, like a possum.

They make a little squeak sound every time he steps.

Oh, look.

He's so cute or imputer the more you talk about it.

I doubt honestly.

Yeah, yeah.

Like a little elf or a stuffed animal or something.

You ever wonder why he's so good at running on the top of the fence?

He sometimes will be in the waiting room at ear wolf and I'll see Scott go by with a little lemon in his hand and then he goes back with no lemon in his hand and then he comes back with another lemon and I'm like, how's he doing this so fast?

Anyway, I'm not saying, you know, and no matter what your feet look like, treat yourself, get a pedicure, feel confident, you know, then take pictures of your feet and upload them.

Get horny on man.

Put them to the grid.

You know what I mean?

Whatever your social media presence is, it's time for a vibe shift.

Hashtag feet.

What's popping up when you click on that hashtag?

Hashtag feet.

Yeah.

Scott.

Come on.

What do you think?

Probably close up some feet, but I have no idea.

I'm imagining your discover page right now on Instagram with the algorithm is giving you based on what you look at and it's twisted.

It's all that in love Island three and I've uploaded pictures of all their feet, the entire cast that you've taken yourself or Nancy, the feet of a goddess, Zenib, the feet of a goddess, colon, this is not love Island.

This is not love.

This is what this is.

Yeah.

When I hear Zenib, I know you're talking about love.

What I'm talking about Bartissen Cole to the most selfish, disgusting, self involved feet you'll ever see.

So do the feet, I mean this and this is a good question, I think.

If I'm judging my own questions, I give it an A plus.

But you know how every once in a while you'll see a dog who looks exactly like its owner.

Do feet look like their owners?

Yeah.

If someone's flexible enough to put their feet up next to their face, their face just gets wider.

Strykingly similar, really.

Yeah, yeah.

Give me a flexible person.

Give me a clean foot.

Give me it next to someone's head.

I feel like we're now suddenly we have a new fetish.

We're just getting pretty worked up.

Give me someone who basically uses their feet to make it look like they're wearing podcast headphones.

Oh, like putting, oh yeah, each one on left ear.

Whoa, I'm listening to you.

I'm turning the volume up.

He he I'm listening to Max's Pastor bedtime.

I'm listening to comedy.

Oh, I'm getting ready for Christmas.

Do you feel I need to I want to ask because now I'm starting to think about my own feet.

Do you feel like the character like that that any attributes on a person's foot tells you something about who they are?

Yeah, you know how you can read a palm?

Can you read a foot and learn something about the person?

And the way Scott's always talking about like skull size tells you a lot about aptitude and all this stuff off mic that's like so interesting because none of us know a lot about it.

Right, but racially tinged.

I think we can agree upon.

I'm just talking about an article I read.

Okay, it sounds like for knowledge.

I'm uncomfortable.

Yeah.

Uh huh.

Oh, yeah, you could absolutely when you're looking at a foot, you can absolutely say like, oh my God, the fallopian tubes are here that you read through this here.

Let me rub this.

Wait on the.

Make your thought activate your thought.

We're not talking about physical attributes.

We're talking about like personality.

Yeah.

What do you mean with like a big main toe?

Are they greedy?

That's kind of what I'm looking at.

Yeah.

If your second toe, they love money.

Are they?

Is that where you're getting at, Max?

Oh, okay.

Come on.

You've lost me against God.

We're getting into another tinged area here.

No, no, but if the second toe is bigger than the big toe, you're sociopath.

If your third toe is bigger than all your toes, you're a good person.

Oh, oh, so close.

You're dry.

Yeah, yeah, because you're so ashamed, you live in shame.

And so you thought about your actions a lot.

And therefore you treat people well because you live by the golden rule, which is reciprocity.

Right.

Interesting.

What do you think of shoes?

Should people not feel allowed to wear them or what?

Everywhere except the airplane.

I think everyone should be bare-played.

The airplane.

Yeah.

Is that a safety thing?

No, I think it would really, if everyone's looking at each other's feet on an airplane, there'd be a lot less anxiety about being in a metal tube hurtling through space.

That's true.

Also, they tell you when you fall into the ocean to take off your shoes immediately.

So it's like, yeah, you get a, because they'll drag you down.

And so it would give you a head start, wouldn't it?

I think it's made me because if you have shoes on when you fall in the ocean, you probably have stinky feet.

And that's the last thing that sharks want to eat.

Stinky feet, really?

Yeah.

And it's the first thing that mosquitoes want to eat.

Uh-huh.

The smell of the, well, come on now.

I talk to Texas always like, you're feet are incredibly stinky.

Mr. Ocarvin.

Yes.

And I'm like, what are you going to do about it?

And you never have any solutions.

You're so good at doing the talk to text voice.

You should just do that.

You should just speak for that voice.

It's pretty comforting.

I'd prefer that voice to your normal voice, if I'm being honest.

How dare you?

We are enemies.

Look.

Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

No, no, no, no.

You're even doing the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Give me Scott Ocarvin.

So that's not a verbal affectation.

Give me verbal affectation.

That's just something you mean to use.

Okay, well, look, Dr. Footman, uh, uh, I appreciate you being here.

I don't appreciate you kind of, you know, bearing, uh, for no, uh, uh, for no.

For lack of a better term, uh, bearing my, my secrets.

Uh, I'm losing interest in this dismount, even as I say it.

What do you think about that?

Is that due to you?

Is that due to me?

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Because you decided to be disrespectful, as opposed to thanking me for coming on the podcast.

Do you think we got off, off on the wrong step?

Foot step.

Oh, I see what you did there.

Nice.

I've never heard that before.

Um, but you have heard get off on the wrong step.

Yeah.

As in like you trip up the stairs, you should up the stairs.

Shatter your front teeth.

Uh, you give yourself a concussion.

Most people are falling down the stairs.

I have to say, if on a Trump, the rest.

What do you think is buried in her grave?

Um, Ulysses, that's great.

Okay.

All right.

Look, uh, Dr. Footman, where you need to take a break?

Is that okay?

We, we need to get to our next guest, uh, on the other side of the break.

Can you stick around though?

Because I think they have really nice feet that you're going to be very interested in.

I'm into it.

Okay.

Great.

And Max, how do you feel about sticking around?

I feel great.

I, I, I would love to see their feet.

Yeah.

We all agree that we want to see their feet when, when we come back.

Okay.

Hashtag feet.

Um, all right.

We're going to come right back.

We're going to have more Dr. Footman, more Max Sylvester.

We will be right back with more comedy bang bang.

I'm going to do this.

Comedy bang, comedy bang.

We're back.

Uh, Max Sylvester.

Past my bedtime is the show.

Uh, it's not really a show.

It's a piece of content.

Right?

It's just, it's, it's slop to put in your bucket to chug before you go to bed.

And have, you know, no dreams on ambient.

It's just, it's just grist for the mill.

Sure.

Exactly.

It sounds like the perfect thing I'd be washing my feet.

Okay.

Absolutely.

So you, you take care of your own feet, but you can't do anything about mine.

They're beyond repair.

Well, you can tell me that and so keep it, you know, you keep saying like, well, come back in a month and see, see if anything's different.

Yeah.

Because I want to see how you're doing with your feet.

You know, it's about self care.

Okay.

And you're doing them self hard.

Okay.

I'm doing, I'm really there worse.

Huh?

All right.

Never mind.

All right.

Well, we need to get to our next guest and hopefully we'll see their feet, but she's been on the show several times.

She is, well, she's a citizen of a town.

Definitely.

I can't remember what the town is, but she's a truck enthusiast.

We can say that.

Please welcome back to the show.

Kayla Dickey.

Hey.

Hey, how are you?

Hey.

Let's see them feet.

Oh.

I'm not going to be showing my feet today.

Today?

When will you be showing your feet?

Well, I mean, it's, it's going to, I'm going to need some money to show that off.

Oh.

I like to get paid for that stuff.

I mean, we work in Hollywood.

You have to value yourself monetarily.

What's a lot to her is probably chicken feet to us.

Dangle an opportunity that we'd have good honor.

I would take 25, 30 bucks.

There's $100 to keep your shoes off the rest of the recording session.

You had that 100 already out.

It's incredibly sweaty.

It's been sitting in my palm.

You pull that out of your shoe.

Yeah.

I guess I'll take off my boots.

The wallet of the clothes.

Well, my boots are off.

Oh, oh.

There they are.

Yeah.

Oh, what's wrong?

What do you call that?

What is, what do you call that condition?

A boater-inducing foot.

I don't know why you don't find this attractive.

I think it's incredibly beautiful.

I would just like to say for the audio record, you know, I just got you asked me to come on and be a good sport.

I'm just uncomfortable with the three-on-one sort of dynamic.

Yeah, I know it's fucked up.

Do you want to switch over to her side?

I'd like to be asked to take my shoes off is what I'm saying.

Oh, sorry.

Okay.

$100.

Come on.

I mean, $100, even though it's not a lot to us.

I'd still take it.

I would love $100.

Hold on a second.

Here, there's $100 to take your shoes off.

Sopping wet like a wife you get at a barbecue restaurant.

Oh my God.

What is going on there?

Well, that was in the other foot.

The other foot sweats a little bit more profusely.

Why?

My umbrella was like covered in like a lotion.

Yeah.

I made sure that my feet always take care of your feet.

You never want, you never want dry feet.

It's the opposite of the army.

What?

Sure.

Have you seen casualties of war?

The boots and socks are one of the top things, right?

In the army.

I want to keep your feet dry at all times.

Okay.

Got it.

Kayla, the record on the paper.

Yeah, Kayla, sorry.

This is your thing.

Anyway, see you guys later.

No, no, no.

No, I think I'm going to go.

No, no, no.

We're sending.

No, no, no.

We're sending.

We're sending my time.

Yeah.

Hey, hey.

Welcome back to the show.

Great to have you.

So great to be here.

For people who this is their first time hearing you.

Missed you.

It's great to have you back on the show.

Missed you.

Always enjoy having you, Kayla.

So for people who don't know who you are, you live in where is it?

I live in Colorado, Southwest Colorado.

Montrose.

And long story short, you used to work for a guy named Judd Webby.

Yeah.

So, okay, the recap.

Basically, I was, I used to work for Judd Webby, who was the mayor of Montrose.

With my girls, we were all his secretaries.

Then he burned down the town when he left.

The entire town.

A lot like Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

Yeah, exactly.

But that cow used to just foot to kick over a lantern, which started to fire.

But Judd Webby, what did he do?

He left multiple curling irons on.

Right.

He started the fire, which, and then he fled into the woods, and he was living as a bear.

And then he came back for a little bit, and then he left again.

And obviously, throughout that, I was fucking him.

Me and my girls were all having sex with him.

Right.

They were the entire soup to nuts.

On and off.

Yeah, whenever he was in town, and not a bear.

Right.

Anyone have sex while he was a bear?

I had sex with him when he was a bear once.

Was that different, or did he have the same?

He was good.

It was in the dumpster.

Oh, great.

Okay.

Say no more.

Then, then, basically, I was working at David's bridal with my girls.

In the meantime, I've been dating just guys, like, on, you know, who picked me up in their big, big, big trucks.

I walk along the streets, and they come by, and they yell things at me like, hey, stupid little bitch, and get in here.

And then I climb up their 15-foot-tall wheels, and I get in there, and we fucking ride.

Yeah.

We go.

Now, the last time I saw you was truck week.

Yeah.

Right.

And that's...

Well, you saw me on the tour, also.

Oh, it was a busy week.

Yeah.

But truck week only happens once a year.

Truck week is a once-of-year type of thing.

Yeah.

And all of truck enthusiasts, specifically the Ford Rock Hard series, descend on Montrose, Colorado, for one week, where we suck and fucking do that.

They're in the big, big truck.

Yeah.

There's nothing funny about sucking and fucking.

Let's keep it straight for you.

Yeah.

And I'm always single for truck week.

Yeah.

Absolutely, I have to be single.

And Judd Weaby was fine with that.

Well, obviously, like, at that point, like, we haven't seen Judd in a while, to be honest.

Oh, really?

My boyfriend was this guy's shark.

Oh, right.

Yeah, you told me that's a shark.

I don't know if I was a shark.

But now I have a new boyfriend.

Oh, congratulations.

Who are you with now?

Barf.

Just Barf.

Okay, well, that's great.

And he...

How long have you been seeing this gentleman?

Um, like, for like a month.

So it's like pretty serious.

Yeah.

Yeah, it's pretty serious.

So from late October till now?

Yeah.

So Halloween, is that when you got together?

Halloween.

We got together.

We got a water bottle.

And he was...

Well, how are you a water bottle?

I dressed up as a water bottle.

I was like...

That was not you just looking at whatever was in your direct line of vision.

Was it?

No.

Was it a water bottle?

It was a true story.

You're probably just spooked by how eerie the coincidence was.

Because yeah, we had a lot of the rest of the year.

It was right in front of you.

I mean, that would be like, if you dress as a wolf man, I walk in here, there's six wolf men.

Yeah.

It's weird.

Weird mystic stuff happens more around Halloween.

I like to make sense.

I believe in witches and everything.

And this is truly a witches moment.

I was a water bottle.

I was a now gene.

So like old school water bottle.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

So that's it for that.

And then it...

Barf picked you up in the truck.

Yeah.

So then of course, I left this party because I was like, this like no guys with tiny, tiny dicks here.

So I left and was walking down the street and then the sky drives by and he's like, Hey, hey, you dumb fucking asshole.

Who's such a little bitch.

Do you say anything like turn around when I'm talking?

He was like, look up at me.

Smile for me.

And I gave him this, I mean, really good smile.

Oh good.

Yeah.

Well, that's how I like that.

All my teeth.

I showed all my teeth bottom.

Oh, this is smart.

Mostly bottoms.

Mostly bottoms, really.

Yeah.

And he didn't, did he comment at all on the costume that you're wearing?

Yeah.

Because I feel like that's such a line.

Like, don't those things like don't they put plastic in the water when you drink them?

And I was like, yeah, I'm old school.

It's not a good pick up line.

It's not a like if I would be more like, Hey, let me drink you in.

Yeah.

I mean, but he said I'd like a swivel plastic in the ocean.

What?

He said don't those water bottles put plastic in your water.

Huh.

I thought the like barf truck thing that this guy was going to be really like, you know, fuck the environment, but that he's got a line on.

Yeah, no actually.

He's really serious about his water.

And he's like, yeah, yeah.

He's doing this as well.

What?

Let me just say that's what you wanted to interject.

I hadn't, I hadn't talked in a while.

I just go ahead, say, say whatever you need to.

60 seconds.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

No, I don't want that one.

No, no, no, no.

Okay.

Go on.

Sorry.

Oh my God.

It's mine.

Like it's all good.

I'm here actually though, because I wanted to tell you guys like obviously the holidays are coming up.

Yeah, obviously.

I mean, so exciting.

Yeah.

Are you so exciting?

Christmas is coming in the- I missed you.

Did you not miss me?

Yeah, it's always wonderful having you on the show.

I enjoy talking to you.

Why can't you say that you missed me?

I don't know that I have as much as I just enjoy having you on the show and you're a wonderful guest.

Okay, fine.

How many are coming up?

Yes.

Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.

Exactly.

But- He's put a penny in the old man's.

And I don't want any of those pennies that you just pulled out of your shoe by the way.

Those are- These are- Yeah.

They're not even jangling.

It's just like a sploosh.

What will you take off for these splooshy pennies?

It's like you've got a handful of boba tea in your hand.

It's a little stoke.

Just squishy.

But- So what do you have to do with the holidays?

Because nothing that we've talked about previous has anything to do with holidays.

You have to buy a gift for Bart that must be a little less formal.

Yeah, far, far, far.

That's what I said.

Well, it was just like in my town, like we celebrate holidays a little bit differently.

And I'm just like really excited.

So holidays just hit different?

When the holidays come around, they're spin of fiveshaft.

They had super fucking different in our town.

What happens?

Well, first of all, we have rock hard eve.

Oh, that's not Christmas eve.

No.

This is rock hard.

This is a separate holiday only in your town.

Dedicated fully to the Ford rock hard series.

Yeah.

What are they up to now, by the way?

Five hundred and fifteen.

Five hundred?

So now I'm doing the fifties anymore.

They're like going in between.

They're doing small numbers now because of just like issues with the supply chain.

Oh.

So they'll give like part of a truck.

They'll make part of a truck.

You can buy that.

Oh, okay.

So it's the 550, but with stuff missing.

Yeah, exactly.

Like sort of like a three wheeler in no hood, you know, but it's cool.

Yeah, like you're lucky if you get like a mirror or like if you get like a wheel.

Yeah, great.

That's just mostly what they're up to.

But you can go on the Facebook message boards for that.

Sure.

Like get all that.

Get all that.

Yeah, I don't.

I really want just a cursory bit of information about it.

So, so what is Ford Rock Eve?

Ford Rock Eve.

Ford Rock Hard Eve.

Rock Hard Eve.

Every Ford Rock Hard Eve.

All of the towns people come together to feast on a pile of roadkill.

Where we eat and we fuck.

And I got to visit this town.

It's a book.

There's a lot of events where people are just, I don't think you guys like you and us would do great in this town.

Probably not.

Yeah.

We take shots of gasoline.

Oh, oh, geez.

Things get pretty fucking wild.

And then at night, all the women go home.

During the day.

Yeah.

I was fucking in the.

Wow.

Shots of gasoline.

Wow.

I had when I was envisioning it, I presumed it was like midnight or something like that.

No, midday.

We're talking noon.

Midday.

Yeah.

We're just blind when they first meet each other and they go to their little retreat area and everyone's just fucking and sucking because they're so happy to not be in the pods anymore.

Yeah.

It's not each other.

Although some of them would like to, right?

No, I've seen that.

They fucking suck.

There's like the things attached to the wall that are like for them to get out the energy or whatever.

Yeah.

Right.

So there's one episode where they're just fucking and sucking these.

I mean, they're not.

They're not.

Dildos, but they're like, it's like rubber.

They're wall attachments.

It's like textures.

Yeah.

They're like, that's berries.

They're sucking your fucking these schnaz berries.

But they're so depleted after that they can kind of then have like real conversations and connect.

Yeah.

All their juices are out.

So they're like, they're most intellectual they're going to be.

And is that what rock hard eve is like by the nighttime?

What happens?

By the nighttime.

All of the girls in the town leave their boots on the roof.

I'm into it.

And the next morning we wake up and you look in your boots.

And if the boots are filled with chili, you've been a good girl.

And if the boots are filled with soup, you've been a bad girl.

Wow.

And that means what?

What's the distinction between chili and soup?

Is it just a thickness?

Here we go.

A connoisseur, a true food.

You're asking hard.

I mean, because some soups are thick.

Yeah, you can get a thin chili.

You can get a thick soup.

Yeah.

And chili is so good.

Are there like kind of Talmudic scholars that are kind of looking at these questions of rock hard faith of saying like what defines chili, what defines soup.

This is like in the comedy bang bang writers room we were trying to crack a sketch about the world's largest slider or the world's smallest hamburger, which is it?

You know, right.

Well, you tell us or do we have to walk this show?

Do you have to watch the show?

No.

It was an episode number.

We never, it never got eaten.

Oh, you didn't solve it yet.

Sure.

It was cut it.

Dropped.

Our dress rehearsals for that show were legendary.

The crowd loved it.

That was after the castle.

This went up on the door.

So so a soup, which is thin, bad, bad, bad, really thin, bad girl, you've been a bad girl and chili, which is slightly thicker, you've been good girl.

Okay.

Are your rewards?

Is the reward for being a good girl, the chili?

Yeah.

And you get to stay in the town.

And you're punishing.

Oh, oh, wow.

So if you get soup, you are asked to leave.

Well, you're asked to go on 40 days and 40 nights.

Tripp of rock hard.

It's about three months.

Like Jesus.

I think they probably 40 days, the day and the night is, and it's a one.

Moses.

I don't think it's 40 days then, 40 nights.

Oh.

So you, oh, so you think it's just 40 days?

It might be.

Yeah.

So it's a little more than a month.

It's not 80 days.

I thought.

I know.

I was like, it's a month that I have.

What are you talking about?

I thought they were allowed to come home during the day after the 40 days were.

This isn't a great British Bake Off.

Okay.

This is like the, you are stuck there.

You're stuck.

Should more reality shows let the contestants go home at the end of the day?

I mean, I think it makes them a little bit healthier.

You know what I mean?

Like love is mine.

Would it be better if they were like, okay.

You've been in the pods all day.

Go home for a while.

Meet some real people.

Yeah.

If you like any of them.

We connect with real life.

That's what they do in the second round.

In the second round, but I, they're, by then they're hypnotized into thinking they like these people.

Like them.

Love them.

They're opposed.

You're a real love is blind connoisseur.

Yeah.

I'm going through it.

You like better feet or love is blind.

That's a toss up JK feet.

Yeah.

Anyway, so, so do they stick their feet back to your story?

Do they stick their feet in the boots with the soup and the chili?

Yeah, you have to.

Oh, that's right.

I forgot to, I forgot to mention you're wearing a blindfold.

So when you put your feet into the boots, you have to gas.

Did I get chili or did I get soup?

And how's, what's the punishment if you get it wrong?

So it feels like your punishment is already decided by what's in the boot.

Yeah.

What's the reward?

What's the right?

Because it seems like immaterial to what's going to happen.

If you've been a good girl or a bad girl based on.

Yeah, like the level.

It's just fun to gas.

Oh, it's fun.

Oh, yeah, sure.

It's, I'd say it's levels to this shit.

Yep.

Thank you.

Yes.

Yeah.

Anyway, if you've been a bad girl, you get sent to the desert for 40 days.

40 nights.

Wow.

And that's where you have to survive all by yourself.

No one else around you with nothing but a truck.

Oh, well, that sounds pretty easy.

Yeah.

And two boots full of soup.

Yeah.

Like you can do.

You don't need to bring the boots.

Oh.

It's actually really hard.

I can't believe this is your reaction.

It's very hard.

How much gas is in the tank?

Well, how much have you drank?

It's a good point.

Yeah.

You'll be, didn't think about that.

You'll be puking and shitting out gas for at least a week after black hard eats.

Yeah.

If you're lucky.

Three days and 33 nights after you finish diarrhea.

Exactly.

You don't count days where you diarrhea.

Those are just no.

No, diarrhea dates.

You're out of commission.

Those aren't real day.

Those don't pay your day.

So don't pay your day.

Honestly, today's the diarrhea day for me.

So they're basically not even here right now.

The year 365, how many day, how many diarrhea days do you have?

Give me a number.

I think I'm like 300.

300?

A year.

Yeah.

Diarrhea days.

Do you have coffee in the morning?

Coffee in the evening, coffee at supper time.

Win coffee in the morning.

Like if we're coffee on a bagel and I'll diarrhea.

So why do people drink coffee if it just gives everyone diarrhea?

Because what are you even doing if you don't drink coffee?

Don't you want to live your fucking life?

You ever see though, like in a Starbucks, especially here in Hollywood, like all these people, all these women dressed up and you just met and they're getting these giant frappuccinos, you just imagine them shitting.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

I mean isn't that the point?

I mean how are you supposed to leave the house if you don't blow it out in a rush?

People are just walking around with all of it in?

Like so sexist of you to just like blame Starbucks on a woman.

I want to see Scott's morning pages.

It's probably like and then I pictured a woman having diarrhea.

What goes in must come out, etc.

That's why I think it's weird to go on a first date to go to a restaurant.

It's like you're just, you know what I mean?

It's like you're just feeding the beast.

You're just a little bit too.

What is wrong?

You don't want women to eat.

Yeah, no.

What would you prefer to do?

What's your ideal game?

Pick them up at noon, they don't eat the rest of the day.

Do you want them starved?

Yeah.

I want them up early.

Honestly.

Getting out what they need to get out.

Awake, I want them sharp.

I want them tired by 7 feet.

Well usually talking the first 4 hours of the day is all diarrhea.

I really think about it.

Because if you have one cup of coffee that's going to, I mean, that's going to put you in the bathroom for most of the day.

So have you been a good girl every year?

No.

I've been bad.

How many years?

I've been bad for like 4 years.

Wow.

4 years running?

Yeah, 4 years running.

No, what do you think of it?

That's like 4 day years and 4 day nights.

Yeah.

4 year nights.

Thank you.

Such good math.

What do you think you've done to turn you into such a bad girl?

I mean, I've been bad because like I talked back.

To whom?

To a guy.

Oh, okay.

So it's the men of the town.

Yeah, the men of the town.

That wasn't clear.

I thought there was a mythical creature like a four-drop car.

Well, it's supposed to be the...

Like Henry Ford, the ghost of Henry Ford.

No, it's the ghost of Gerald Ford.

Oh, interesting.

Yeah, and he fills your boots.

But really it is the town's men.

Oh, got it.

Yeah, like the council.

Oh, it's a select group.

It's town council, yeah.

Okay, so it's now voted on.

No.

Democratically.

It's a select group of people appointed.

It's problematic that they have that power over you throughout the year to sort of say, hey, if you don't do this, things might look bad in your boots or whatever.

Because that fills that put you in a position where you had to do things to get the chili.

And guys would say don't you want the chili.

Yeah, I mean, I get it.

But like I just like, again, like I've lived in the community for so long.

I just support like all the men with their big rock hard trucks and their small, small, tiny sticks and like that is just like, I'll do anything for them.

So if they tell me like I'm doing something wrong, like whatever.

You're willing to change your life.

Yeah, like I will go out there and I will go to the desert for 40 days and 40 nights and I will ship my brains out.

And I will like, I mean, I get really creative out there.

In what way?

What do you mean creative with what?

Like building a roof over my head.

Oh, so shelter.

Yeah.

So I would imagine you have to forge for food and you have to build shelter.

Although I guess you have the truck for shelter, but you can't sleep in the job.

Oh, you're not allowed to sleep.

Oh, you have to survive.

What is the truck for?

Why are you bringing it to get to the desert?

That's part of the that's part of the tradition.

Your your boyfriend sends you and his truck out into the desert to survive.

It's not your truck.

You have whatever content he's left in the truck.

So last year I got left, just like some leftover McDonald's.

By the way, there is no McDonald's on the table here.

So this is stuff that actually happened.

I got less some Kleenexes.

Some trash can.

A little sign that said this area is regularly disinfected.

Do you leave you any sure podcast microphones?

Yes.

Yeah, to create my own podcast.

A blazer.

Well, that's I mean, this is a terrible story.

Max, I don't know.

You feel about this?

I mean, I just I have a lot of thoughts, but I feel like I'm an outsider judging as a community.

I don't live in and what might be weird to me is normal to you, but not to give him a daughter, but we I've never walked in your shoes.

Oh, my God.

I'm like feet.

I might pass out.

All the blood is rushing to my groin.

But what about this Gerald Ford?

How come you know, Gerald Ford is a 38th president of the United States.

His ghost just doesn't go anywhere.

Usually it's in the swamp, Washington DC.

So what is it doing in Montrose College?

I think that's the swamp.

I mean, it's an interesting take on politics.

University of Florida and Washington DC is the swamp.

The two swamps.

Yeah.

What are you going to do Obama?

Well, I mean, Gerald is actually the creator of the Ford rock hard series.

People think I was like Henry Ford and like Ford or whatever.

Yeah.

But actually Gerald Ford took a break from being president.

Whoa.

To create the Ford rock hard truck.

Is that why Carter got elect?

I had always presumed that it was because people liked him more than Ford.

No.

People were tired of the, you know, the Nixon regime and all that, but it was because he wanted to design the Ford rock hard series.

Yeah.

And he wanted the wheels as tall as himself, he said.

That was his one.

That was the quote.

Wow.

Huh.

You people do sometimes.

I mean, I feel like he has this kind of cartoon reputation as being maybe a dimmer present, but clumsy exactly.

But to find out maybe he was just distracted because he was working on a pretty giant feat of product engineering and yeah, launching this big thing.

He's absolutely a feat of engineering.

Okay.

All right.

Hashtag feet.

If you will.

Yeah.

F E A T A T.

I ate the feet.

Like Viltaco bells.

What?

Well, yeah, my fourth meal is absolutely a foot.

You know, and I'm not, I'm not eating it.

I'm not swallowing, but I'm definitely putting it in my mouth.

I say I'm a foot long, but penny foolish.

Does that make sense?

It doesn't.

It was fun.

All I heard was foot.

Yeah.

So you're on.

Penny thing is a penny foot.

Yeah, yeah, you had me at that speaking of pennies.

Anyone want to take any.

Oh, no.

Oh my God.

They just evaporate.

You put them on the table and it just is a puddle.

Like cereal that's been left in the bowl for a week, whatever.

Cheerios.

Why are you laying your Cheerios in the bowl for a week?

Oh, these are part of the, um, the sexual chess games I'm playing with my wife.

All we write.

That's one of the things we fight about.

Like, yeah, who's going to clean up the Cheerios?

Yeah.

As we're working on a lot.

So it's part of like manipulating her into like having sex later.

No, she's manipulating me by starting a fight.

She's leading the Cheerios out to like, you know, aren't you mad about it?

Aren't you so mad that I won't put away the Cheerios?

Cause I don't like cereal.

I love that.

So which chess, which chess piece would you say you are in the relationship?

Are you a rook or are you a castle or a pawn, a bishop?

Hello.

What do you, what do you mean when you say that?

Just now that I have a little experience and scripted podcasting, it can, it can help to have a narrator or yourself redo the line, but say the thing you're doing, you know, to describe it for the people.

Yeah, what did you just do when you said hello?

Yeah.

Um, I give my hand came out with a little flourish.

He didn't come out with a little.

Came out with a little down at the wrist.

No, no, no.

What I was doing was what bishops do at mass when they go down to grab a little communion way for.

And they place it on your tongue in private while they're saying, I trust me, I'm a neurologist.

I want to see your most trusted thing.

Yeah, we're on the same page.

So how do you think this year you're going to be a good girl or?

Um, I think this year I have been a good girl.

Really?

So you haven't talked back?

I haven't talked back.

I'm not too old.

That's another one.

So you were too old before?

Once you turned 30, no, that this is just like one of the rules.

Right, girls.

Once you turned 30, like you first sure are bad.

Um, and you will be going to the desert.

How old are you?

I'm young.

Yeah, no, I mean, you seem.

No, I'm young.

Yeah.

Is there like a job that they give older women in the town to at least like help keep like windows clean or like the lamp slip, something like that, something useful, like reaper?

I mean, if they survive the 40 days and 40 nights, then they can be brought back as an elder.

Oh, oh, they're just one of the older women in the town who, you know, like maybe owns the bridal shop, like Merg.

You remember Merg?

I remember Merg.

Yeah.

And then I just wanted to see other jobs that are just like manager jobs where they're there there to help the young women.

Yeah.

The young women, they, they corral the women.

Yeah.

That's great.

You're a sexless herders kind of.

Yeah, exactly.

You would love it there, Scott.

You would fit right in.

I really do.

The way that you talk to me when I'm here, your whole energy towards me, the way you wanted to see my feet immediately.

Yeah.

Amen.

Scott's a mantra is man.

You're a mantra, Scott.

Yeah.

There might be.

There's a poster up in my office speaking of older women that says the older the foot, the sweeter the juice.

Okay.

Is this the office that the patients can see or is this sort of a private back office?

You patients enjoy this?

This is my back office.

Oh, you're back.

Sure.

Oh, nice.

Back office.

Yeah.

My front office is just very, it's just my, my speaking spell machine.

I've rigged my text to talk.

Yeah.

I think if I ever saw that, I don't know that I would ever, I don't know that I'm coming back now.

Well, then I'll come to you.

Okay.

Actually, it sounds great as I'm looking to get specialists to find some people that come to my house.

Yeah.

Incredible.

Not bad.

Well, I wish you luck, Kayla.

I mean, this is a great time of year.

And I hope that you come out of this on the other end with some chili in your boots.

Thank you.

I don't think I've ever said that before.

Wow.

Well, I missed you.

It's great to have you on and many hamburgers to you as well.

Much chili to you.

Anything.

I appreciate that.

May you have chili in your boots.

May you find chili, but also a little soup.

What does that mean if you have mostly chili, but a little soup?

Even a little bad.

Oh, okay.

It's always good to be a little bad.

And I hope you end the day with a foot in your mouth.

I don't know.

All right.

Well, we're running out of time.

We only have time for one final feature on the show.

And that is, of course, a little something called plugs.

I can hear your plugs theme.

Oh, wow.

I'm going to do my phone.

Beautiful.

Can I stream your TV show on all platforms?

What's your Twitter handle?

Can I get those deeds?

Want to see where you're playing in the city next week?

You give me plugs, plugs, plugs, plugs, crazy plugs.

You give me plugs, plugs, plugs, plugs, plugs, crazy plugs.

Wow, that was Crazy Plugs by Adam Schilling, which I believe is a parody of the Van Morrison song.

Crazy Love.

Is that right?

Yes.

It's more like a mama.

It's beautiful.

I thought it was a parody.

Oh, okay.

You didn't think it was beautiful?

I thought it was a very funny parody.

I didn't see you laughing.

I saw you crying during that.

I think you'd add them.

Guys, what do we want to plug?

Obviously, Max, we have passed my bedtime.

Please.

I'm going to stop there and let you take over.

I would love it if people would check out, pass my bedtime on Audible written by me and Leah Beckman.

Also, I'm on social media as Maxwell vestry, but I give almost no content to that.

So don't follow me.

Unfollow me if you do.

And what's Leah up to other than, um, pass my bedtime?

She wrote on the new Pitch Perfect spinoff, Bumper in Berlin.

That premieres in this week or next on Peacock.

Yeah, that looks good.

Check that out.

All right, with a friend with the show, Adam Devine.

Exactly.

All right, fantastic.

Dr. Footman, what do you want to plug?

I'll plug the first two seasons of Righteous Gemstones.

Just the first two?

You think the third's going to be bad?

No, it just hasn't come out yet.

Won't be out by the time this podcast comes out.

I mean, look forward.

I don't know.

But people are listening to this in the future when the third season is probably going to be out and you don't want people to go watch it then.

Right.

So let's say you have a friend of a friend and you're discovering the podcast and you start from the beginning.

So maybe sometime in 2027, you're listening to this episode.

Yeah.

Stream all the seasons of Righteous Gemstones.

Not just the first two.

No, no, no, no, all the seasons.

And so also stream Hey Randy on the CBB World Patreon.

Oh, give me Randy Snott's.

Give me his scandalous, devious girlfriend, Carissa.

Also, his best friends do an amber.

You can't forget them.

Yeah, give me all those perfection, especially the live show.

We loved it.

Do you want to do more of those?

What's that?

You want to listen to more of this?

I'm not a fan of the big.

It's not a threat.

Okay.

All right.

Do you know?

No, I'm genuine.

Never mind.

Oh, yes.

You want to listen to more of that?

Would they?

Would it be fun for them to do more shows?

I wonder.

I've had a lot of people ask me about that and say DMs that say something like, you know, show me your body more.

Hey, Randy live.

You're getting these.

Yes.

Yeah.

Interesting.

Well, because they know you're his doctor.

Well, I'm subscribed to the Patreon.

Oh, okay.

So, oh, I didn't realize that was a feature when you're at CBB World.

You can just send random DMs to everyone.

It's going down to those DMs.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Well, fantastic.

Kayla, what do you want to plug?

Okay.

Well, I would love to plug all the Ford rock hard trucks.

I would like to plug.

Even just the 100 model?

Even the 100.

I would give it a...

Really?

I don't know.

It's a whole...

I would give it a...

Literally.

For Ford rock hard 150.

I would like to plug a...

The movie Spirited coming out.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

There's a really good little girl with it.

Oh.

Oh, perfect.

For a free amount of time.

Stunning feet.

The horniest feet you can think of.

And then the...

This CBB presents podcasts.

This book changed my life.

The Stitcher podcast going deep.

And also the very easy social media handle at LAOYYYYYYYY.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oh, Scott, I forgot.

I should plug one more thing.

Sure, yeah.

Obviously, the website.

Wiki feet.

Okay, sure.

Inspired by Julian Assange.

And animations should be free.

Yeah, et cetera, yeah.

And speaking of peacock bumper and Berlin, starring Adam DeVine.

So shrink on peacock.

Oh, that's right.

Yes, people can see shrink now, which it just got put up in the last couple of months.

So that's wonderful.

I want to plug so many things.

First of all, the Comedy Bang Bang book coming out in April.

We want to make this first week.

We want to make it a bestseller.

So pre-order the book right now.

You can go to CBBworld.com slash book.

And we've...

I got to say, I've seen the numbers and we've sold a lot.

So, but we can sell more and try to get up there on the bestseller list.

That would be very cool for people to open the old gray lady and have to see what turned out to be number one and go, what the fuck is this?

This looks stupid.

I also want to plug the best of voting.

Best of voting is now open.

Go over to CBBworld.com slash vote and vote for your 10 favorite episodes of the year.

And we'll count them down at the end of the year.

And while you're over there, go to CBBworld.com slash book and enter our contest, which is if you've bought the book, just show your receipt and you can enter to...

We're going to pick one person to...

I'm going to let them pick an episode that they want to sponsor in the best ofs.

And I'll say whatever you want me to say about it and talk about why you liked it.

Go to CBBworld.com slash book.

Now, okay, let's close up the old plug bag.

One hand, put it up.

Take the other, put it down.

You're gonna make a box.

It's time to start to close it.

But don't close it too much or you open up the plug bag.

We're opening up the plug bag.

And when you open up the plug bag, you open up your heart.

For the rest of the world, I'm talking open up the plug bag.

I'm going to open up the plug bag.

Oh boy.

That was Don't Fear the Plug bag by Dunkin' Meek.

I also call that quit while you're ahead.

Guys, I want to thank you so much.

Max, always great to see you.

Please promise you'll come back in approximately 12 months or so.

We can talk about this again.

Kayla, wonderful to have you.

So good to have you here as well.

Missed you.

It's wonderful to have you on the show.

Dr. Footman, what else can we say?

Hashtag feet.

Absolutely.

We have to say that.

I'll see you soon either in my office or at your house.

You come to me now.

I'm going to keep coming to you and keeping you on as my doctor.

I want you to come to me.

That's the only way.

I promise I'll say nicer things about your feet.

Okay, you will?

That's really all I'm looking for.

Because there's nothing wrong with them.

I just go in there for compliments.

I didn't know that.

Yeah.

Will you give them to me?

Yes.

Okay, thank you.

What a beautiful little possum.

A little house squeaks.

Do you have any more money in there before we go?

Yeah, here we go.

Let me take off my socks.

Oh, here's a few twenties.

Oh my God.

Here's the five.

Here's some nickels.

There you go.

Oh my God.

This guy's literally shitting his pants.

He's shitting my pants looking at all this money.

He loves it.

Oh my God.

Well, let's make sure he did.

Take off those pants.

All right, we'll do.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.

Bye.

Here you go.

Bye.
