♪♪♪ I bought a zoo too, but you don't see me make a movie about it.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Ah, yes.

Wet weather pounding the Southland here as we record this episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

Welcome to the show.

My name is Scott Ocherman.

A very rainy episode here today.

We hope that won't affect it, but if you hear the pitter-patcher of little sprinkles, please forgive us.

I'm Scott Ocherman.

We have a great show coming up a little later.

We have a person who works in hospitality.

We also have a coffee impresario, and this is incredible.

Coming up a little even later, we have a person with exciting news.

So that will be in sea block, I believe.

But before we get to them, let's, the stars are back.

Look, what are we even saying? The stars are back.

And we have a huge star here on the show today returning to the show.

He's been on once, twice.

I think maybe only once.

Maybe only once, when, what were you doing?

Why were you?

I was me.

I was.

But why were you on the show?

Talking to this thing.

I was, I, oh, you can bring it closer.

You don't have to like lunge forward to reach it.

It comes to you.

I forget.

I don't think it was a specific, maybe what, maybe I was doing Eagle Heart, Adult Swim Show.

Something like that, but it's been a while.

Probably almost 10 years.

Since he's been on the show, but he has an exciting new project.

He wouldn't come on for the Borat movie, but he.

They wouldn't let me.

No, I wasn't allowed to talk about it until way later.

Okay, sure.

But now that he has a lesser project that he needs a little boost, he's willing to come on to comedy, bang, bang.

His new show, Paul T. Goldman, has been on Peacock, streaming on Peacock, the season finale of which will be on this Sunday.

Please welcome back to the show, Jason Walner.

Thanks, Scott.

Thanks so much for having me.

I really wasn't able to do podcasts for Borat.

I didn't, then later on, a few months later, my wife.

Thank you.

That's all I wanted.

You know, I don't.

You could have come on and just dipped in and said my wife and then left for an episode.

Of course, Jason, we've known each other a long time.

You were the director and some people called you a, I know we've talked about this on the show, some people called you a member of human giants and.

I don't know how that happened.

Yeah, I mean, I was, I was technically, it was a four person.

Everyone's all there be a promotional picture and you'd be included.

I don't, yeah, I think a lot of you were, were confused if they watched that show.

Because you never popped up.

Yeah, there was worse.

There was worse.

Good looking guy wearing glasses.

Where is he?

Chubby little guy at the time.

Yeah, people must have the same thing.

You want to let everyone know that I lost that one.

No, that I, I'm not.

Okay.

As fat as I was.

I, I, I think people must have watched and assumed that one member of the group wasn't very funny and they just didn't put him in any sketches.

I mean, they even put Terry Gilliam in, in certain sketches.

You never popped up.

Yeah.

No, never once.

I don't think.

Yeah.

But from, that's where we got to know each other from and then you've had a storied career.

You worked on Eagle Heart and, trying to think of anything else before Boris.

I, I would just, I directed stuff.

I did a lot of stuff with Brett Gellman, friend of the show.

That's right.

Yes.

Would you do 1000 cats or?

Yes.

That was that.

And we did a lot of stuff.

I'd last man on earth and directed other TV shows, parks and recreation and bunch of stuff.

You're not auditioning.

You're there.

You're on the show.

Don't worry.

All right.

But, and then a couple of years ago during the, the Demi as we call it, you directed the Borat, the new Borat movie.

You didn't redirects the first one.

No, no.

But I had to watch the first one.

Did you have to watch it really?

Well, I watched it about 50 times.

Really?

Well, I wanted to make the second one as good as I could and.

Right.

Were you trying to figure out like all the cuts and like how they hid certain things.

Really?

Yeah.

Figure out the language of it because it doesn't, I mean they made it intentionally look like not a great looking movie and I wanted to make sure.

Oh, that's why you did that.

Yeah.

No, because you do direct really good looking stuff and Eagle Heart of course looked like an action movie all the time.

Oh, thank you.

Yeah.

It was appropriate for that, for that thing.

Well, that's what a director does.

He not?

They not?

Yeah, that director comes in and says, I want this to look good or I want this to look bad and that's basically all the decisions you made.

I came into the Between Two First movie.

I said, I want this to look good and then it came out like the way it did.

Oh, well.

Good.

Great.

But, so let's talk about Paul T. Goldman because that's, it's a fascinating show.

I've been watching it.

I haven't watched this new one which just came out yesterday because we're taping it at press time.

It hasn't come out yet.

You've seen, I've seen four.

Four.

Okay, that's a lot.

Yeah, you've already, that's quite a reason.

That is a lot.

Well, out of six, that's a good two thirds of them.

Yeah.

But the fifth one just came out yesterday.

Yes.

And let's talk about this show.

What, what, if you were to describe it, how would you even do that?

It's a hard show to describe.

It's probably why it took me 10 years of like pitching and trying to convince people to let me do it.

Let's do the description first and then let's talk about the 10 years because I think that's a fascinating story.

It's a documentary project about a man who has been on a now 15 year mission to take down the crime ring run by his ex-wife that he thinks that may or may not exist.

Yeah.

So it's a, it plays sort of like a true crime documentary.

One of these things you would see on Netflix a lot of times for like a good half of it or a third of it.

There are documentary elements for sure.

Yes.

It is about a real person.

So it would appeal to those people who like the true crime kind of stuff of like, what was the one about the guy who was like ripping everyone off and flying around on planes and stuff like that?

Was it the Tinder swimbler?

Yes, the Tinder swim, it plays a lot like the Tinder swim.

Yeah, that was my main influence in the picture.

But so it would appeal to people who like things like that, but then there's another element to it, which is Paul T.

Goldman, the person in question who this happened to and who also then wrote a book.

He then wrote what?

He wrote basically, yeah, this guy went through this experience, thought it was worth, you know, writing a book, thought it had an incredible experience, wrote it into a book, thought it would make a great movie, wrote it into a screenplay, started contacting people on Twitter, and tweeted at me and told me a story.

And told me a such show me I had an incredible thing happen to me.

I made a book in the screenplay.

So he has it.

So a third of it then is the movie that he has written about it.

Yes.

Starring himself.

Yeah, we shot many scenes from his screenplay and then other things that he wrote about his story with him starring as himself.

Yes.

And he is not an actor.

Not before this project.

No, he now is an actor.

I think he's the only actor who could have played Paul T.

Goldman.

So you have him surrounded by these professional actors doing these scenes from his actual movie that he wrote about this.

And then the other part of it is sort of a documentary about the process of doing this.

Yeah, I mean, it's all kind of trying to look into his brain and see what makes him tick and see what's real and what's not and kind of figure out this very interesting to me guy.

Right.

So now let's talk about how you got involved because he just kind of tweeted you out of the blue one day. Is that what happened?

Yeah, I got a tweet.

He added.

You got a tweet?

I got a tweet.

What a great day.

I got it.

Yeah.

It was 2012.

It was the kind of golden age of fun Twitter.

Right.

And people getting jobs from it.

Yeah, it was not getting fired from it.

It was a whole different thing.

And he said, yeah, I have an incredible story and my screenplay is written and you should direct this movie.

So I clicked on his Twitter and not surprisingly he had tweeted the exact same tweet to literally hundreds of other people.

Everyone that said, you know, director or producer, he was trying to, you know, he was knocking on a hundred doors.

And one answer.

One answer.

So how did, I mean, you get this tweet.

Do you say to yourself, oh, this seems like an interesting fellow or?

Yeah, I got the tweet and I clicked on it and.

Behind the scenes process.

I made it.

You know, when you click on the tweet, you make it bigger.

Yeah.

I did that.

Wow.

And then there was a link.

His website at the time was called do, his book is called Dooply City.

It's on Amazon.

You should read it.

It's an incredible book.

His website was Dooply City online.

He shot a video of himself that's still on YouTube where he talks about and I saw him for the first time and he was a funny guy.

He was an interesting guy.

He was like a kind of a nebishi kind of goofy guy talking about a very serious thing and talking about bringing down this crime ring and empowering himself.

And so I was interested enough that I read the book and just became completely, I read the book in an hour and just became completely obsessed with it.

Now is that because you're a fast reader or it's a short book or did you skip work?

I'm not a fast reader and it's not a short book.

It was just so compelling.

Yeah.

I just fell in love with his voice that every page of it blew my mind in 10 different ways.

Yeah.

And so then, so this was 10 years ago.

Did you reach out and say I want to do something with this or?

I did eventually. I took a few months to kind of just watch his internet activity.

Just monitor to make sure that.

Monitor is, you know, downloads and yeah, as usage.

Just to make sure he wasn't crazy.

I didn't know this person.

I didn't know if he was a dangerous guy.

I didn't know if he was, you know, mentally unwell.

I wanted to like really figure out was this the right kind of person to approach?

I didn't want to approach someone who was not well.

But eventually I determined I didn't think he had mental problems.

I didn't think he was a dangerous guy.

And so I.

And you're not a doctor though.

I'm not a.

We should make that clear.

I became one to make this.

I did go to medical.

Interesting.

I gave it psychology.

So that's why I took 10 years.

You could have done it that year, but.

No, it's more like a hunch, which really I mean, that's how a lot of doctors operate anyway.

Yeah, of course.

So I felt like, okay, this guy is like the.

Especially Fauci, am I right?

Yeah.

Let's get into that.

So I know I just felt like, oh, he's in the zone of the type of people that documentary projects that I've loved have been about like the grizzly man or American movie or kind of like odd outsiders who are kind of very driven to tell their story to the world.

And he kind of seemed in line with that and seemed worth exploring basically.

So did you pitch it around to places in no one bit for 10 years or what exactly.

They were like a bunch of, I would say nibbles, but more like big bites and then they would like spit it out along the way.

I got a company involved this company caviar and we and they paid for me to like interview him and that interview is in a lot of the show and then started pitching it around eventually Hulu bit and then they paid for a pilot and then they said no, thank you.

Now, is any of the pilot still usable?

Yes.

You got to use it.

So you got the pilot back.

I got the pilot back.

It costs some money.

We paid them.

We got the back.

And most of the first episode of the show is this pilot that we shot in 2017.

Yeah.

Okay.

So then the pandemic happens and you direct Borat and it kind of seems like maybe that opens the door to people going like, Oh, I understand what Jason does now in terms of like this sort of fits into that kind of thing.

Yeah, it helped a lot where I could I mean, to me, it's the very different kind of thing than Borat Borat is a comedy character.

Does Paul say my wife ever?

He does, right?

He does say my wife.

He does a lot.

It is a lot like Borat.

That is the defining characteristic of Borat.

We all know he says my wife.

He refers to her.

And as his property.

But yeah, yeah, doing that when you do a successful thing that's unlikely.

I think that's what let you know, peacock feel okay about taking the chance on this.

Right.

And it is a risky kind of thing.

I mean, it's not a normal type of show.

It's not a normal show.

I'm learning that more and more now that it's out in the world and people are seeing it.

I'm remembering how not normal it is.

Right.

But it's great because it kind of feels like a show from like 2022 when there was peak streaming and they would buy a lot of stuff and not just like junk it and bury it and take it off the streaming services without ever showing.

It kind of feels like one of these things of like, Oh, wow, back when these streaming services first started, they had a lot of money and they would, you know, take a risk on something.

And you know, so it feels like something of a bygone age in a way of 2022.

Yeah.

And I mean, I mean, luckily, yeah, peacock's kind of new.

I mean, no one, you know, it's like, wow, that doesn't feel like a peacock show.

But it's like, no one knows what a peacock show is.

They don't, they're still figuring it out and everything will feel like this because it's such a big success.

Maybe.

Yeah.

Well, it's a great show and the exciting six episodes.

It's very gripping my wife and I have been watching it.

Saka Jimmy.

Wow.

Now who's the boring?

Shit.

I've been more at it.

We've been watching it and it's very gripping and very funny.

And I don't want to say exactly where it goes.

But and I'm in, I don't even know the last two episodes where it goes.

But it goes somewhere.

Yeah.

It keeps kind of taking.

Yeah.

Every time I think it's done of like, Oh, wow, they've told the entire story.

I look down and go, Oh, no, there's two more episodes.

There's an hour and a half left.

Yeah.

For you to watch.

All right.

Well, episode six out this Sunday and catch up on all of it on peacock Jason Walleners here.

We need to get to our next guest if that's all right, Jason.

What do you think?

Yeah.

That's fine.

It's okay.

Yeah.

It's all right.

Do you want to talk to her?

No, no, I'm good.

You have anything else?

That was it basically.

That's it.

Yeah.

All right.

Great.

Let's get to our next guest.

She's in hospitality and we've talked to her once before when we were on tour.

I can't remember what city.

But feels like feels like New England somewhere, but let's talk to her.

She works on a cruise ship.

Please welcome back to the show Chibi Dips.

Hey.

Oh my God.

It's open to be on land again.

I am I'm all over the place right now.

I told you whenever I come on land, I'm like, and you're sort of swaying side to side right now.

I'm going to put my own legs back.

Yeah, please don't vomit.

Does the reverse ever happen?

People who primarily are in the sea, they get on land and they get lancic.

You know what happened to you?

You shit.

Oh, it's the other way.

Yes.

So you just.

That's the opposite.

I mean, you're on land for too long.

You just shit your pants.

It's south of the equator though.

You vomit.

And if you're seasick, you shit.

Exactly.

And it goes the other way.

Interesting.

Wow.

It just should come out.

It goes counterclockwise.

I never realized that it came out a certain way.

Oh, welcome back to the show.

This is Jason.

Hi, Jason.

Hi, nice to meet you.

You ever see Borat?

I have seen clips of Borat.

Just clips on the cruise ship.

Have they not shown it in the movie?

They never shown it.

No, they just play Groundhog Day on repeat on the ship.

Oh, interesting.

Yeah.

So that seems meta textual to me.

I don't know what that word means.

Well, Jason's a director and.

Wow.

Oh my gosh.

Wow.

And a writer as well.

Yeah.

You put pen to paper?

Sure.

Yeah.

As a scribe.

Yeah, I've written.

You're sent in like a journal.

Yeah.

So I'm not.

No, just some TV shows.

Yeah.

Some TV shows.

Yeah.

All right.

Well, that's awesome.

Anything that I might know from the cruise ship?

Probably not.

What?

No, I don't think so.

I don't think so.

What kind of entertainment do you besides Groundhog Day do you get on the cruise ship?

You get a human performers, right?

Live performers on the cruise ship.

Oh, yeah.

We have wonderful, amazing stand-up comedians who come on.

They do real fun jokes about women being stupid.

And a lot of my wife jokes actually, that's what I was going to say.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

Yeah.

They get a big this is the year of my wife again.

My stupid fucking wife, my dumb fucking wife.

Yeah.

Wow.

It's awesome.

Y'all would love it.

Y'all.

Do you have a wife?

Is that why you relate to these or are you a wife?

I am a wife.

I'm a wife on land, but also at sea.

Oh, you aren't the same person?

No, different people.

So I have my my land husband and I also have my cruise ship husband's.

I'm a girl.

Oh, yeah.

Because you know, there's a lot of turnover on the ship.

Oh, yeah.

I've worked on there for 20, 25 years now, just on the ship did not leave.

I think it's all you know.

Turnover sounds like what I tell my women when I have sex with them.

She's crying.

Eat up them.

Whatever you do any of the work.

So you think we have sex with someone?

I should physically turn them over.

Yeah, do the work.

Do the work.

Move them around.

Oh, yeah.

That's how you look when I have sex with people, I just lay and they throw me around.

And they just play around.

Oh, okay.

And you're tall too.

I am.

Yeah.

You make women so small.

I am very tall.

No, I'll tell her what you say.

6 to yeah, I'm a 6 to 2 and a half.

So are you sure?

Why you think I can kind of got a lot of that is hot.

Just about my height or about everything.

You've got everything.

Well, okay.

All right, well, we've met once before and did we like each other?

I'm the handbag cruise.

That's right.

I cruise.

Scott loves handbag.

I don't know if you know this.

I didn't know that.

It's apparently I love hand tie.

He loves.

Which is tentacle, tentacle, tour.

Is that what it is?

He loves having sex with octopuses because they do all the work.

Yeah, they are.

Yeah, to do it all.

Yeah, they could flip you, flip you over, flip themselves over.

So we did you miss me?

I barely remember talking to you.

When I heard you were on the show, I was like, have we ever spoken before?

What did we talk about?

I'm a vegan person.

He loved me.

What did we talk about?

We talked about me being on the cruise, how I got on the cruise, which is I took a cruise with my husband and my son right after I gave birth to my son.

Right after?

Yeah, right after.

Fresh.

I mean, they're in fluids when they're in the womb.

So it must have been kind of like a second hole.

Have you never seen much about babies?

The fluids.

Yeah, so well, basically I gave birth.

It was not a big deal for me.

Like I, it just almost fell out kind of situation in the bathtub.

Oh, you were it was a water.

Home water birth.

Oh, really?

And was it a planned home water birth?

Home water as a soap water.

You were just in the bathtub and it came out.

I was just in the bathtub came out.

Yeah, it's in salts, you know, which was bad because the baby absorbs it through its skin.

Oh, no.

Okay.

So does your baby have salty skin?

Super salty skin.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry.

So sorry.

So sad.

So, but this is 20 years ago.

So then we got on the ship and we had a great time that whole week.

And then I just turned to my husband and I said, you know what, I'm gonna stay.

I'm gonna stay.

Y'all go back.

And then I just stayed and I got a job on the ship.

And I worked and I worked.

And then, you know, I'll just send the messages occasionally on Facebook or something like that and just be like, thinking back to.

Yeah.

Have you seen the child since?

Not in face to face.

No, because, you know, when I come on land, like right now, I'm only here for an hour.

Right.

So you have time to do a podcast and then you're lucky is normally I would be doing real fun land stuff.

Right.

Yeah.

I'd be going to a t-shirt shop.

Get me a souvenir.

I'd be a t-shirt on the ship.

Oh, there are.

Life's a beach.

What do you do on land that you can't do on this ship?

Oh, go to Burger King.

Stand by the playpen.

The playpen at Burger King.

Burger King.

Oh, okay.

It's one of those old ones that still have the playpen.

Right.

Okay.

Where did you dock near here?

Oh, and yeah, Santa Monica area.

Santa Monica.

How'd you get here from Santa Monica?

Why do you care about that?

That's so boring.

Where did you go?

If you're at the pier, did you go down then to PCH and then come up to the 405?

I'm not going to help.

I'm not going to.

I got in a neighbor and I said, you know, we're taking you to Scott Ockerman.

He knew exactly where he worked.

Interesting.

You're so famous here.

Everyone nice where you are.

So, how's it?

I mean, 20 years, you have a 20 year old child and you're still married.

I can't believe your husband has divorced you.

We're very married.

We're in love or so in love.

But you never see him.

No, and really on the communication, I'll look at my wall.

He'll say, you know, thank you.

Your Facebook wall.

My Facebook wall.

Oh, yeah.

And, you know, obviously I've been working for.

I was working for a while.

Obviously.

Obviously, y'all know my story because I was on that one time and you remember everything about me and you definitely listed that episode.

Definitely.

Yeah.

No.

What was I going to say?

I don't know.

I used to work for Rhett and the Hat Cruises.

Rhett and the Hat.

Oh, okay.

Oh, that's right.

Dude, we talked about the rats have jobs on your ship.

Is that right?

It depends on the theme of the cruise.

Oh.

So, sometimes, you know, we have doggy cruises, we have kitty cruises, we have Rhett and the Hat Cruises, we're the rat in the hats from the whole ship.

Are they rats dressed like the cat in the hat?

They're rats in the hat.

But are they in cat in the hat hats?

They're at a race in the 90s?

We didn't have all the kibberic way.

Yeah.

Little tiny kibber hats, little tiny buries.

Okay.

Like Captain, like, ship hats or are they?

Sure.

Are they dressing for the job they have or the one they want?

All the types of hats.

And do they work or are they just loose on the ship?

They work.

They make the omelets.

They make the tippin' yaki.

People are okay with rats preparing their food?

Oh, yeah.

No, they weren't for sure.

Well, they're paying, I mean, they're paying to see that.

I would pay to go on it and see it.

I'd bring some snacks, maybe.

Yeah.

That's a bad answer for you.

For the rats, just to encourage them.

Oh, come on.

You bring snacks for regular cruise ship workers?

Yeah.

It's our lead line.

I saw him on the cruise.

He was just in that theater watching that end.

I don't stop.

The whole time.

Are we going to have octopus tonight?

No.

Wait, I eat it as well?

Oh, yeah, you do.

Well, I got a new job.

I'm working on a new.

Oh, a new cruise line?

Oh, yeah.

And this one's fun because it's all different things.

So this is Splishy Splashy cruise ship.

She splashy.

She splashy cruise ship.

She splashy.

She splashy cruise ship.

Yeah.

And so we have all different types of cruises.

I mean, the list goes on and on.

Why don't you say one of them?

And on.

One or two?

What do we got?

Really?

So you've tapped out at zero?

Bad cruises.

We got squirrel cruises, bat cruises, right?

Raises cruises.

Yeah.

So if you get rabies, you come on the cruise.

Oh, oh, okay.

Then what do you do?

And you've tapped out.

Rabies is 100% fatal.

I don't know if you know that.

Yeah.

I knew someone who got the thought they got bit by a bat.

They didn't think they got bit by that.

They did get it.

There was a bat in their house, right?

And then if you, if there's a bat in your house, you have had a bat encounter.

And her husband had some sort of a rash or something like that.

No, no, no.

Yeah.

The story.

How do you know these people I know?

His story was on Facebook.

You went viral.

Oh, okay.

Went viral.

No, it sounds like I should click on that to make it bigger.

Wait, any bat in your house, you legally have rabies and have to die?

Well, legally you had a bat encounter.

You had a bat encounter.

But isn't the only way to test for rabies, they have to cut your brain in half.

What?

That's true.

They only, that's the only way they can test lengthwise or straight down the middle.

Yeah.

It's down the middle, down the half.

That's what I'm saying.

They do it like a hamburger or they do it like a light or like a club sandwich.

You cut a hot dog in half like that.

Down the middle.

Down the middle you do.

Straight down the dog.

Half one with a half hot dog.

Half another woman, another half a hot dog.

I think they cut it down the middle like between your eyes, which I think you can survive from you just it makes you like a weird person.

And what are they looking for when they do this?

A certain pattern.

A pattern of like, I think I have rabies.

Yeah.

You can see that.

You're bringing in a certain way.

Like polka dots or something.

Something like that.

Yeah.

Wow.

Okay.

Did that ever happen to this person's husband?

No.

They cut his brain in half.

No, they didn't cut his freaking brain open.

He found a bat in the bed, climbing up the side of the bed.

Okay.

With his wife?

His wife was not there.

Oh, thank God.

She had COVID.

So, wait.

They separated.

COVID and she was in Los Angeles.

This is the kind of husband who is not like, oh, you have COVID.

Well, I'm going to get it.

Just go and let's sleep together.

Well, this is more successful.

So he's working a job.

Say no more.

The man is more successful in her relationship.

You know, I've been encouraging you so much every time I say, you got to do stand up on the ship.

Keep it right.

You're so good.

Give us some of your stand up.

Does it have to be hentai themed stand up because that's the only cruise I want to do?

It's the only thing in your brain.

That's all you remember.

So octoposes, they have eight arms, right?

Like, yeah.

Why don't we have eight dicks?

It took me a second, but boy, did they?

Worth it.

It's a thinker.

That's one you'll get on your way back to your cabin.

Well, I already got it.

Okay.

Well, good.

Go back to your cabin.

Okay.

No, I don't go.

By the way, you know, when I sleep in, I told you this, but we all sleep multiple people per cabin.

Per cabin.

It's just you're rotating through sexual relationships.

Oh, yeah.

Of course.

No, it's one big, like kind of orgy when you're in those little cabins because it's like 26 people.

Yeah.

And we sleep in a little chain.

In a chat, how do you sleep in a chain?

What is that?

I wrap my legs around your neck.

Oh, okay.

I wrap your legs around his neck and then he wraps his legs around my neck and then, you know, things get crazy.

We all flip over.

Okay.

But I want to keep talking about my cruises.

Okay.

So have you thought of more?

Shut up.

I know my crazes.

Okay.

Well, you just started working there.

So I know you can be forgiven for not knowing every single day.

I appreciate it.

So what do you have?

What kind of cruises are the splishy splashy?

Oh, Jesus.

There's all sorts.

I mean, obviously people can do it for like self-help reasons.

Can do what?

Go on the cruise for self-help.

And it's a self-help themed cruise or?

Yeah, no, it's like, you're going to get better on the ship.

Okay.

You know, kind of thing.

So if, you know, people who suffer from diseases like they love Disney or they love musical theater, they come on.

And they get cured?

And they get cured.

So I was thinking you should come.

You love musical theater.

Yeah.

And I'm going to go to the airport for Disney as well.

So that would be a good cruise for you.

You could get better.

I can get better.

I'm probably in for you.

This sounds like that kind of like, what is that, that treatment that people go through to not like musical theater anymore?

And what do they do?

Yeah.

It's like electrodes and stuff like that.

Shock therapy.

Yeah.

You don't have that.

No, what we do is we just sit them all down in a room and we blindfold them.

We tape their mouths.

We tape their legs together and we just lay them there.

Pretty much so.

And that solves it.

You just torture them.

Yeah, because in their head they're going, they're thinking of all the musical theater over and over and they're like, I'm going crazy.

I can't do it anymore.

And then they're cured.

So that's actually for example, you love it.

All right.

Well, is that for Disney or for musical theater?

I guess they tie you in together a lot of times.

Yeah.

Because if you think about the characters.

So it's whatever you're thinking about when you get tortured in that situation you get cured of.

Yeah.

Oh yeah.

Okay.

Why you don't trust that?

You don't believe that?

I don't know.

It doesn't seem like a problem to a lot of people.

Like, oh, I think about Disney too much.

Okay.

Well, you've never been on the cruise.

Okay.

When you went on hand tie, the hand tie cruise that you were on was meant to cure hand tie.

It was.

You just went double down.

It was all in.

You're obsessed.

What else do we got?

We got cruises for brothers and sisters who were too touchy.

Not like they sleep together or anything, but you know, like how when they pose in pictures they hold each other.

This is not a cruise to cure them.

This is just for them to enjoy this.

Yeah.

This one's for them to enjoy.

Okay.

Yeah.

So you wander around the ship just kind of like awkwardly touching your brother or sister.

You get to touch your brother or sister.

You know, you get to sit on your brother's lap something like that.

No one's really thinking in their heads like, well, that's a little too much.

Right.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, I do know.

You ever seen that account online that's like, are they brother or sister?

Are they dating?

I have.

Yeah.

It's like that, but none of them are dating.

None of them are dating.

Okay.

So the question never needs to even come up.

No, no.

It's just a safe space.

Right.

Safe space for them to be around.

Yeah.

Great.

What other types of cruises do you have?

What else we got cruises for guys who wear the little newsy caps?

Oh.

Okay.

That one's a self-help one too.

Oh, that's to cure them.

We've got to cure them.

How many are these to cure, and how many are just for people to enjoy the cruising?

I say happen to have.

Happen have.

Yeah, you know, it was safe space.

Oh, there's another one, safe space for men to learn about how women, when they have tampons in, they can pee.

They can.

Okay, they can't.

They can pee.

They can't.

They can?

They can, Scott.

They can't pee.

It doesn't get on the tampon?

It does, yeah.

Not on the part that's already up there.

Oh, it does.

But on the string.

The string does it.

Okay.

Did you have any other questions?

That was my only question.

Was the tampon gets wet with pee?

Yeah.

It does.

Okay.

But it doesn't, so the pee part is just by the string.

The part that pees?

What?

So the string.

Yeah.

So half the tampon's already up there.

Okay.

Half?

Yeah, it's about half.

Really?

Oh, is the string about half?

It's about half a half.

As long as the tampon itself.

Why you want the string to be longer?

You want it to be like a big long tail?

I want to.

I thought it'd be shorter.

Shorter.

Yeah.

Like a little firecracker.

You don't want it to get lost up there.

Oh, got it.

Then you have to go in.

String.

Strings everywhere.

Okay.

What else you got?

Close strong.

Shut up.

We're coming up.

We're six.

The date.

Just the date.

No connotations other than just...

No, not the insurrection.

Just the date.

I seen the dating it before the insurrection.

Yeah.

We'd been doing it for 20, 25 years.

Really?

I love January 6th.

And when the insurrection happened, did it sort of put a damper on this cruise or...

No, so much more business.

People love it.

People love January 6th.

Do you screen for insurrectionists or...

Oh, no, no.

Okay.

Oh, yeah.

Another cruise.

People who love Johnny Depp.

I don't know that I want to go to any of these cruises you're mentioning.

What are you talking about?

You love it, Scott.

You loved your hand tie.

All right.

Close strong.

We're coming up on a break.

I already did.

You already close strong?

That's strong.

All right.

What else do I got here?

Cruises.

Cruises for people who love to pretend to be at the airport.

Okay.

How would that work?

How?

We just pretend like you're at the airport.

You come, we put you through security.

Security screening.

You lose your bags.

You have no deal where your bags are.

You go up to the front desk, we say, the flights being delayed, the flights being delayed, your just back there.

Is there a Jersey mics that they've converted to making breakfast?

There's a subway that serves the best breakfast you've ever had at an airport.

Oh wow.

It's just long pieces of dry bread.

A lot of people drinking at 7 a.m.

Oh yeah.

Yep.

Trying to, some people doing like all of a bloody merry, like just a safe face, but then there are some people who are just like gin and tonics.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Exactly.

Martinis.

And you know, it's just a safe space to pretend to be at an airport.

Yeah.

Fantat and are there planes flying above all the time or?

We play sound effects.

So it's a whole on like a Disney experience.

You've got people on the loudspeaker of like, you know, gate, gate 25 has changed to gate 32.

Okay.

30.

Is this your job?

No, no, no, no.

What are you doing on these cruises?

Is that what you do?

Yeah, I do the loudspeaker.

Oh, okay.

So you have to make this.

Can you do your best airport plane sound effect?

Yeah, sure.

Ladies and gentlemen, we would like to announce that.

59 is now gate 561 and we customer Scott Kerman.

Please bring his and thought to the front so that we know where he's going to store it when he's on power.

Thank you.

So you might.

And then do the plane to the plane.

Oh, no, sounded like that one exploded.

Yeah.

Well, we're at the airport.

So people love planes go down.

Right.

Oh my gosh.

Well, look, Chippy, this is congratulations on your new employment.

This is incredible.

Thank you so much.

You know, I got to spend obviously I have to spend five to 10 years on the ship, but I get obviously I get my one hour off and I'd like to spend it with you.

I love it.

Come back anytime.

But can you stick around because we have to take a break?

Oh, yeah, I guess you might be a little late back to the ship.

I hope that's okay.

No, really.

Make it.

It's fine.

I'll do it like an Uber from here to Santa Monica.

Here is a full hour.

I you may not get him back on this shift.

That's all I do.

I'll figure it out.

All right, we'll figure it out too.

We're going to come right back.

We have a coffee impresario coming up later and a person with exciting news.

You do not want to miss that.

We'll be right back with more comedy bank.

After this, comedy bank.

We're back with Jason Wallener, director extraordinaire.

Good.

And Paul T. Goldman on Peacock.

Five episodes out now, episode six this Sunday.

And is there room for a sequel?

That's kind of explored in episode six.

I don't want to give it away.

Okay.

All right.

So, but I mean, maybe he is something else interesting could happen to him.

Perhaps interesting things seem to happen to him.

All right.

Well, I'm excited to see what happens.

We also have Chibi Dippy.

You've been on the- But Cibi dip.

Chibi dips.

You've been on the phone trying to contact the ship I've noticed.

Yeah, I'm talking to the captain right now.

Is the captain a rat currently?

That captain is a bat.

Oh.

The captain is a bat and you're trying to hold up the ship trying to what's going on.

I'm just saying, you know, guess what?

Can't believe it.

I'm stuck at Scott Ockerman's ass again.

Hey, get out.

You locked your door.

So it's going to be a while.

Well, good luck to you.

I hope that you get back on the ship.

We have to get to our next guest if that's all right.

He's a coffee impresario, which I don't exactly know what that means, but I would imagine he makes coffee or sells coffee or something like that.

Please welcome Bill Smither.

Hey, Scott, thanks so much for having me.

Yeah, my pleasure.

How are you?

Very good.

Thank you.

Let me answer that question that you asked right before I was allowed to speak.

And that's an impresario.

I'm a coffee sort of a curating.

We should just mention to the audience.

I'm not disallowing or allowing.

I mean, it's a free country.

You can do whatever you want.

You don't explicitly ban somebody from speaking or holding back what it is.

But it's impolite to do that.

It is impolite and you give a, I would say, a pronounced glower.

A withering look.

Yes, they sort of.

Because you approach the mic and you almost answer that question.

Rarely could go.

I shot you a look.

You shot me a look.

I felt cowed.

Mm-hmm.

I felt shamed.

Good.

But truly not explicitly banned.

Right.

I was in my legal rights to speak anyway.

Okay.

I'm going to make sure that was clear to you.

If there are any lawyers listening, I do not think you have crossed any boundaries.

Okay.

Beyond your rights.

And you would sign an affidavit.

I would sign an affidavit.

As long as I could add to the affidavit that there was a glower and I did feel shame.

Okay.

But I would have been.

Try to put that in the language in there.

So.

Okay, that'd be fine.

We'll have it.

I'll run it by my lawyer and we'll run it by your lawyer.

Okay.

Great.

Yeah.

We can work something out.

Yeah.

I think we're going to do it before this episode comes out though, I think.

Because it always.

Yes, we would have to.

Remember them to do this ASAP because lawyers can be very slow.

My lawyer is quick.

Is he quick?

Really?

He's very fast.

That's why.

Mine's very slow.

So it sounds like we'll get around a normal amount of time then.

We'll average out to about a normal lawyer.

Okay.

I feel optimistic because I think we're in the ballpark of agreement here.

Okay.

Great.

I might have to work on dot and some eyes, cross some teeth.

Sure.

Yeah.

Or dot and the T's and cross in the eyes.

I don't even remember about that.

You want to get wild.

I'm not.

That's not stand up for a team.

Right.

Yeah.

We're going to work that out.

But welcome to the show.

You were saying coffee.

Coffee.

Yes.

So I'm a coffee.

Well, first of all, Jason, by the way.

Oh, hello.

Nice to be here.

Your director.

I understand.

This is pippy chippy.

Chippy dip.

Oh, chippy dips dips.

Okay.

Like a plural of dip.

Exactly.

How is it going to get set?

Yeah, it is with a Z.

Oh, it is with a Z.

Oh, okay.

Did you spell it with an S?

In my head, I was.

Chippy dips.

Dibs.

My pleasure to me.

I've never been on a cruise, but I look forward to it.

It is a sort of fucking...

Are you thinking you will be on?

I am.

It is one of those things where I imagine someday I will be on a cruise.

I feel like you have to do it before you die, but that could be any day.

I know, but I think a cruise is something you need to organically arrive at and not force.

Not planned, really.

It seems like most people plan their cruises.

I don't think that is the way you can work out for me.

You think you will just arrive at Harbor one day and just like chance getting on a boat and then it sails away and you are on a cruise?

Yeah, I think I will just be going about my business running in air and I will look up and I am on a boat and I am like, hey, doing this for a while.

Also, I would like to say lots of people die on the ship.

Oh, do that.

How many per cruise would you say?

Oh, 10, 12.

What do they do with them?

Oh, they just throw the body over board.

You never existed.

Yeah.

It sounds like a nice way to go.

Yeah.

It is a beautiful way to go.

You are staring at the water, staring at the sky and your eyes slowly die.

You should just die of natural causes.

Yeah.

Nothing is killing you.

Instead of just being there, time to pass away.

I would love for you to come on and pass away.

That doesn't deter me.

I think that would be great.

You know, because I am staring at the water.

Staring at the sea.

Close your eyes.

You are dead.

I mean, I have certainly had visions of deaths that are a lot more traumatic than that.

Your own or someone else?

My own.

I guess somebody else is too.

Yeah, I will get a vision.

You would envision other people dying horrifically.

Yes.

Well, what I will do sometimes for sport, I don't know if you guys do this, you walk it down the street, you see strangers and you wonder, I wonder what kind of person this is.

I wonder like what is going on in their life, you know?

What are they thinking about?

I wonder what they were like when they were much younger or much older.

Just sort of, you are not thinking too hard about it, but just sort of a fleeting wondering.

Sometimes when I am in that type of reverie, I will be like, what if they die by getting caught in a safe.

Caught in a safe.

Wow.

Like an old school Warner Brothers cast iron.

And so what is happening?

Someone opens the safe to get some money out of it.

Maybe there's some money they're putting some important things.

And they're not looking behind them.

Like when I close my refrigerator door, I always have to look behind me and see if my dog's head is in there.

That's what I'm thinking.

It's a dog.

Oh my God.

The teeny over to a German shepherd just knocks into their keister.

In the safe.

Shucks slam eight to nine hours later.

They have their...

Five sectors.

Yeah.

Oh, oh, wait.

So they're inside this.

I think it's holy inside the side.

Deep long safe.

Because it's a little more grizzly if they're bisected by the door.

Could be bisected by the door like half the torso just clipped.

Yeah, half the torso.

So what I'm...

Yeah.

A sharp, but torso so sore.

Like up to the ribcage.

Yeah, so half your head, half your arm.

So just half the entire body.

By the way, you cut a hot dog.

Exactly.

Straight down the middle.

I was thinking straight down the middle, but it could be just up to the ribcage.

I was thinking like a club sandwich where it's diagonal.

I think that like an open face.

Yeah.

Yeah, maybe that.

Anyways, some kind of horrific death.

And I'll be like, well, I'll never know.

You keep walking down the street.

Yeah.

Like I don't know what's going to happen to that person.

Yeah, I've never caught up with a person and found out if that's ever happened to them.

I've never turned around and raced after them, but I have run into people by coincidence later and I'd be like, you're going to think this is crazy.

But I saw you earlier on the street and I don't know how this happened.

I was thinking about you getting bisected long ways by saying.

And do you ever see them again after that?

The one time I did this that was the only conversation I did.

Interesting.

Yeah, they were a friend's wife.

A friend's wife.

Oh, yeah.

And so you saw a woman, you didn't know it was your friend's wife.

You saw her walking down the street.

Someone was going to just what caught your eye about her.

Well, so I'll just be honest here.

I'm about 50 years old.

Okay.

And this woman appeared to be.

When you say about 50, what are you 58?

You don't know.

I'm in the realm of 50.

I was adopted and my birth certificate was in dispute.

Oh, in dispute?

Who was disputing it?

My biological parents and adopted parents didn't get along and they had a debate about it and they never really let me know how it worked.

Never settled.

But I know that I'm in the realm of like you're in the realm.

So you could be under.

It could be over.

Hey, here's hoping for your birthday today.

Have a birthday.

It just, yeah, every day.

Do you celebrate your birthday?

I do.

I have an observed birthday.

What do I, which day did you pick?

I picked what I think is the most fun date.

Oh, what's that?

I want you to guess.

January 6th.

That's what I should have done.

December 25th, what'd you say?

January 6th.

Oh, yeah.

That would have been fun.

No, I picked April 15th, tax day.

Oh, that's fun.

I don't know why because everyone's so miserable that if you can bring, you know, hey, don't worry about it.

It's my birthday.

I don't know that that would give me any sort of solace or comfort.

It's true.

I don't care.

Really.

It hasn't worked.

But that was my plan.

Interesting.

All right.

Anyway, I love coffee.

I love coffee and I'm an impresario.

So wait, what attracted you to the woman?

Oh, right.

She appeared to be around my age, sort of late 40s, early 50s.

Right.

And so what did you think you had a shot with her?

I wasn't that.

It was just sort of like I was relating to, oh, look, someone my age.

I was going through some...

It's like when you see someone at the exact same model or make of car and you're like...

Yeah, you do sort of like, hey, do you think it's a community?

It's a community.

Yeah.

I was just sort of, I would be honest in that particular day, I was insecure about my life and where I was at and how things were going.

I wonder why.

Yeah, I wonder why.

There's no reason because...

I mean, I don't know anything about you yet.

Well, things are, I would say, are going solidly par.

Par.

You're at par.

Hey, that's where you want to be if you're golfing, right?

Par ain't bad.

It's kind of an achievement to get that a lot of time.

Think about it.

If God, however you understand it to be, came to you and gave two doors.

Through this door is a random state of life.

You don't know.

Good or bad.

The door is par.

Like an average life guaranteed through this door and the other door is a crapshoot.

Could be the best ever, could be the worst ever.

I would take par.

You take par every time because it's certain.

Is it the only life you're going to live?

Because I would say the highs and lows would be interesting if you're living like 10, 20.

You get multiple shots.

If you get multiple shots, if you're just going to live one comfort, I might be good.

I think in this hypothetical scenario, it's one and done.

You get through the door and that's it.

Yeah.

So like just an average size penis.

Yeah, I guess it would apply to everything.

Yeah.

That was not the first thing I thought about, but yes.

Sort of an average hog.

So what are we talking like for?

What size is the average one?

A little higher.

What do you all think the average is?

Average is three, two inches.

Well, I believe it's a little more interesting.

I guess we're talking average.

It's more what your performance and use of it is and if you're thinking about it.

No, we said about the size.

Oh, rare size quaky chips.

I'm a size queen for sure.

It sounds like my mattress.

It's used to clean.

It does literally sound like a size uncomfortable.

It's very uncomfortable.

I thought you were doing well and then I hear you have a queen.

Oh, God.

I don't mean to be overly grisly about sexual details, but you're a tall lady six foot two.

Is that part of the reason why you're a size queen?

I mean, that might, is it more important to do because?

Well, first of all, I think all women size, I know the size doesn't matter just to make y'all feel better.

Oh, thank you so much.

Because y'all are fragile.

That's, I am.

I am fragile and I appreciate it.

If people are lying to me, I'm glad.

When I'm getting railed in the tiny little cabin, someone physically turns you over.

If I can't feel it, I'm going to yell a code alpha.

Yeah.

Code alpha.

That's going to bring the security team into the room.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

This guy's got a small deck.

We need to throw him up.

What a terrible way to find out that you're not pleasing somebody sexually code alpha.

So, but you guys like white coat.

But I didn't even say code beta.

When I say code beta.

Yeah, that's.

I mean, that literally was.

Are those the 10 to 12 casualties on the each.

Prose or?

Absolutely.

I'm throwing them over.

Aren't we having a nice time?

We're having a great time.

I don't know.

I can't tell how, I don't know what the vibe is.

I'm trying to figure out all's vibe.

Who's vibe?

The vibe between us and let me look down at my notes.

Bill Smither.

You know, remember someone's name when you meet them?

We just met.

You know, it's pretty.

That's a pretty.

It's an easy to.

It's a generic.

You seem very average in our names.

I feel it.

I am proud of being average.

I don't see why that's something to be ashamed of.

Yeah.

In school, you get a C plus.

I feel like that scene is a bad gray, but it's like above average.

You're like, hey, it's doing pretty good.

You're right above average.

Yeah.

Comforably, invisibly above average.

Tell us about the coffee.

What do you want to hear about the woman?

Yeah, tell us about the woman.

I can wrap it up quick.

Yeah.

So I was insecure about my life and I was like, I wonder how she's feeling about her life.

She's a stranger.

I didn't feel that I could ask her, but that maybe think about I wonder where she's at.

How she's happy with her life.

Maybe we were born around the same time, but wonder if she remembers the same TV shows.

Like what?

Mash, moonlighting.

Yeah.

You know, the animals.

V.

Hmm.

I didn't, you say some of the moonlighting bash?

Would you?

I said, I said, Matlock.

Matlock.

Yeah.

You were?

As a background artist, yes.

Oh, wow.

Background artist?

Mm-hmm.

You were a term that only you used to describe your function.

The time that you...

Now we were called extras at the time and then suddenly I'm in charge and they say you've got to call them background artists.

And not a lot of us talking.

You know, Matlock had great, had great extras, I remember.

A lot of...

They had a lot of color in character.

A lot of shows to get a lot of good looking people back there, but Matlock wasn't afraid to mix in a lot of normies.

Andy Griffith very read his complexion.

He was read at that time.

He was very read.

He was like a beat.

It's funny because I normally know him for black and white television shows.

That's true.

Andy Griffith and so you wouldn't know that.

Then on Matlock, it is exposed to the world.

That guy is red.

Yeah, suddenly color TV is invented.

Yeah.

And it's like, why did we like this guy?

He never would have made it.

He just read as a dang tomato.

He never would have made it in the cinemascope era.

Exactly.

So tell us about the coffee or are you gonna be not wrapped up?

I love the coffee.

I love the woman.

I didn't wrap up the woman.

She was on my mind because of where she was at.

Later, you met a friend.

Yeah, the friend.

And then I met a friend.

Hey, this is my wife.

This is my wife.

I was like, God, saw you in the street and I imagined the end of your life.

Yeah.

And then have you ever spoken to that friend either?

I've never again.

I only spoken to him over a Facebook messenger.

Oh.

Which is the least intimate of social media shows.

I mean, not according to Pippy Poppy over here.

Chippy.

I feel that Facebook messenger is the most emotionally distant of the thing.

I think it's the most erotic for sure.

The most erotic of the thing.

That's the only way she communicates with her.

I think Instagram is way more flirtatious and intimate connection channels.

Whoa, what is the difference?

Something about being on the same platform with your mom, your dad.

That's what makes you not erotic.

Anyone can say yes.

Anyone can say what your spouse did.

My great uncle contacts me on Facebook.

It feels like a very like sanitil de-sexualized.

But that's why you like it.

You want to get caught.

You want to get caught on there?

I'm just in on your son's wall.

I would say that it's the most sterile and emotionless of the social media channels.

OK, well.

Instagram's flertier.

Twitter.

I would put in between those two.

Twitter is for demented people.

You think the world's ending?

What about words with friends messenger?

Oh, that's, you know what?

I think that's pretty intimate.

Because you've got to be friends.

You have to be engaged in a task.

You have to successfully play an activity.

There's a winner and a loser.

You're already pretty close.

And then they start putting some moves.

Yeah.

That's pretty hot.

I thought that might be the hottest.

Tell us about your coffee.

So I love coffee.

Great.

What makes you an impresario?

An impresario is sort of an arranger, you know, like almost a producer.

Like some of you're a go between like you're you the man in the middle between coffee and the people who buy it or I like to organize coffee themed events.

OK, so maybe like a coffee tasting party or if I think that somebody is a particularly talented roaster.

I will try to connect them with a good coffee shop.

Someone called Jeffrey Ross.

Yep.

I do enjoy his comedy.

You know, he's not afraid to.

He goes there.

Yeah, he goes there.

So you when you say you enjoy doing this, do you get paid to do this?

I have sometimes gotten a little money for it, but that's not what it's about for me.

It's a.

I wouldn't call yourself an impresario.

That's such a dominant term.

That's how I see it.

For someone who does this as a hobby.

I connect people that need connecting.

Yeah, I think I'm I'm sorry.

Look, I've tried other I've tried other terms that don't feel right.

It just don't seem to fit.

I've tried organizer.

I've tried coffee organizer.

It's like you organize coffee.

It's like no, because that that's.

I agree.

That implies like you're alphabetizing the road.

Yeah, I'm dealing with the people.

I'm dealing with like the baristas.

The relationships.

Yes, I'm trying to get the the human really producer is the best term, but in this town.

But that sounds like you're making the coffee.

Sounds like you're making movies.

Right.

Exactly.

Would you be so crazy a movie about coffee?

I mean, would you ever make that Jason commit now?

It doesn't I have to kind of hear more about what the idea.

What about making a show about it like, Oh, forget about a sequel to Paul T. Goldman, because he's he's done.

He's tapped out.

Okay, but this guy over here Bill Smithers looked at right there.

He like listen to his life, you know, he's like a very interesting guy.

Make the sequel about different people.

And then suddenly like, yeah, that's the way I go.

Yeah, I could tell you to be a nice and polite to me.

And I appreciate it.

I take pride in not being an interesting guy.

Okay.

Is that really what you are most proud of?

That's one of the things I'm proud because I look, I don't mean to talk about the young people, but they sure do love to make it about them.

Okay.

And I like to blend in.

You know, I don't mind.

I don't like coffee.

I was like, yeah, that's admirable.

I think yeah, everyone's trying to kind of make a name for themselves and you seem to be doing the opposite.

Happy to be in the background.

I don't, a background artist of life, I might say.

You're not the matlock of life.

Not at all.

I don't need to be bright red front and center solvent crimes, bursting blood vessels while I do my speeches that I barely want to memorize.

I don't mean to be talking to the director at asking him to change the blocking.

The director not understanding why ringing up that I was in a face of a crowd, a movie critically regarded and not thought of a lot these days.

Yeah, you don't want to be that.

You want to be the like me in the background, just doing that job.

I'm happy to do it.

People as a prop.

So why are you on the show then?

Yes.

I am beginning a new project.

Great question.

I am a fan.

But you want to get the word out even though you don't want to make it about yourself.

I want the project to be to get attention.

I don't necessarily need to be known as the guy who's doing it.

Right.

Even though you're an impresario.

Even though I'm an impresario, but I'm a behind the scenes impresario.

Pull in the strings.

I'm like a...

Cepetto.

Yeah, like a Cepetto.

I don't think he pulled any coffee actors.

Well, I mean, he didn't he for a while until...

Shumbul.

You know, Pinocchio is off on his own.

No strings.

But pre-Bluefairy.

No, he had no strings.

You've never had any strings.

I think at least once or twice he did some play acting with Pinocchio.

He's a puppet.

We can agree.

Pinocchio is a puppet.

Can you imagine?

Absolutely.

There are two things you can do with a puppet.

You can pull their strings or you can shove your hand up their hands.

His dad used to shove his hand up his hands.

What?

No, that's a string guy.

Pinocchio is a string guy.

There's no hand up that ass.

Why are you here?

So, have you heard of Starbucks Reserve?

Oh, yeah.

It's the nicer Starbucks.

Exactly.

So there's like, you know, Starbucks.

Is it better coffee or just a better environment?

It's better coffee.

It's more select grounds.

Why don't they make every Starbucks a Starbucks Reserve?

Hey, I agree.

Because some Starbucks are just there for you to use a bathroom.

That's it.

You don't care about the coffee taste like.

It's a little place here.

First of all, it's just a bathroom with a coffee thing attached to it.

You go, you destroy that thing and then you leave.

Right.

Okay.

So these are Starbucks reserves.

Starbucks Reserve are a little pricier, a little more better quality coffee or at least more exotic, rare coffee blends.

These Starbucks reserves, locations themselves tend to be a little bit more kind of fancy, sort of like slightly better sort of like furniture.

The lighting is a bit lower.

Rich neighborhood.

It's supposed to be rich.

It's supposed to be like a fancier Starbucks.

And it's more expensive to boot.

So probably the reason why they don't make them all like that is not everyone's interested in paying the extra, but this guy loves it.

Well, also it's the theory I used to hear about Coke and Pepsi was that they were owned by the same company that they just had the competition there of like, what's better so that no one would ever talk about RC or anything else.

It's like traction.

If we're just talking about two things of like, what's better?

Well, I like Coke.

I like Pepsi.

No one's ever talking about the other.

But that's not true.

I don't think it's true.

No.

No, no, it's not true.

It's an interesting, useless example.

No, not true at all.

How does that work?

This doesn't apply and then never happened.

But it was an interesting fact.

Yeah, it's an interesting, wrong fact.

Didn't we say one earlier an interesting wrong fact about slicing one's brain open to find out that you have rabies?

You think that's wrong?

I think that's right.

That's got to be wrong.

I would like to say there's got to be another way to test.

There's got to be another way to test.

There's also only one person who's ever survived rabies.

Who's that?

I don't know if I believe that either.

Tim Balz.

He had it.

No, there is one woman.

She survived.

I don't know who.

So wait, even if you get rabies like a dog with rabies bites you, can you get a treated in the...

If you kill a symptoms, you will die.

You will die.

Period.

End of story.

But they have to be able to treat it before you develop.

The only way to stop it is to cut your brain in half.

You got to cut yourself a little bit like a condom.

You have to do it.

You have to get yourself straight down the center.

Unfortunately, that kills you.

But you don't die of the rabies.

Well, it's cool.

Which is cool because you die under your own way.

On your own terms.

So yes, I've heard of these Starbucks reserves now that you've explained them exhaustively.

Thank you.

So I am starting an informal organization called Starbucks Reserve Reserve, which means you are already attending a Starbucks Reserve.

I have scouted you.

And I believe that you deserve an even higher, more premium experience than you're getting at Starbucks Reserve.

Deserve to pay for one?

Or you just, is that no extra cost?

At no extra cost.

You enter a special club called the Starbucks Reserve Reserve of which I am the...

Is it attached or do you have to take a bus to it?

It's right there.

I bring the experience to you.

You're building it in a Starbucks Reserve?

Yes.

Because it's not a physical location.

It is a club.

It is a cat.

That sounds like a physical location.

Yeah.

Okay.

It's true.

It's an existing physical location.

It's not a new physical location.

Most buildings exist already.

I would say they just renovate them.

Okay, that's true.

Is Starbucks aware of what you're doing?

No.

So...

So you go into a Starbucks Reserve.

I go into a Starbucks Reserve.

You tap people on the shoulder.

How do you do this?

I set up camp.

I get my laptop.

I'm doing this?

Yes.

They can't kick you out of a Starbucks, by the way.

Legally?

Legally.

No one could be.

No matter what you did to that bathroom, they still can kick you out.

So I'll go in there.

I'll set up camp.

I'm scouting everybody.

I'll spend hours.

I'll watch for the regulars.

Now most people aren't there for hours.

But I'm there for hours.

So the people that use...

Sometimes you'll scout someone and go, oh, that looks like a good one.

They'll leave before your three hours are up.

I lose a lot of people.

But if they're really worth it, they'll be back.

And they come back and I'll walk up to them and I'll tap them on the shoulder and say, hey, do you want a special experience?

Well, you say that.

How do people respond to that?

I'd say low like that.

It's a very polarized question.

When you just say, do you want a special experience?

That's what I say.

I go walk up to my tap and say, hey, do you want a special...

Do you want a special...

What percentage of people say yes to that?

80% the conversation's over pretty quickly after this.

And there's a polite and sort of...

How have you thought about changing what you say or what you say?

I don't think this is part of the selection process.

Okay, so what happens to the 20%?

We 20% who are intrigued.

I'm like, all right.

Out of that 20, how many people just ask for clarification?

Most of them do.

Okay.

I put a finger up.

Okay.

That's not...

You put it against their lips?

Sometimes I'll...

Well, I won't touch them, but I do move it close to the lips.

Now, if their lips touch your finger...

That's not my problem.

That's not you.

Okay.

And I'll have an affidavit written to excuse myself from that.

And I'll just say, do you want a special experience?

Well, their lips were asking for it.

Put my finger up.

I'll be like, come with me.

They go over in the corner.

They sit down.

I set up a little TV table.

I put a nice little table cloth over it.

And I set up a special roast that I have had friends of mine prepare who are expert coffee roasters and preparers.

This is not a Starbucks roast.

It is not a Starbucks roast.

This is your friend's roast.

It is a little roast.

You'll set this up.

Set this up.

And I'll give them a mug and I'll be like, try it.

This is the Starbucks reserve.

Interesting.

I didn't know you were allowed to bring your own...

That's the one thing I think you are.

You can't do it too.

You're allowed to sell your own coffee at a Starbucks.

I don't sell it.

They say you can bring anything you want in here, just not your own coffee.

They really do frown on it.

But I don't sell it.

That's how I serve it.

You give it away.

To strangers.

Have you been asked to leave ever?

Sometimes I'm asked to leave.

By the people who work at Starbucks or by other...

I just say it by other people themselves.

No, once I get them into the corner and I'm pouring them, I have had 100% success rate.

Really?

What do you need to find as success?

That they like it.

That they like it and they say, thanks for doing this.

I appreciate it.

So two things.

They have to like it and they have to thank you and that's success.

100% success rate.

100% people.

Wow.

And then what happens?

Then I let them go on their day and I'm like, next time you're in here, if you want another one, give me the old high sign.

What's the high sign?

High sign is sticking your arm fully above your head and waving and waving.

Because I'm out at that point.

Well, you don't have to...

That's a one and done for me.

I haven't had any high signs, but I'm waiting for them.

I have seen some of those regulars again.

When the Starbucks people tried to kick me out, I have an interesting technique which I once saw a woman do in a Starbucks.

I just look at them, so they'll be like, sir, can you please leave?

Can you not do this?

And I'll just say, no worries.

No worries.

And they need to say it.

Just look at John's eyes and go, no worries.

No worries.

It's so not specific.

It confuses me.

It confuses them and they just give up.

And I go back to my corner.

No worries.

My worries.

No, I say it in normal.

You say it in normal, bland English.

Yeah.

And Starbucks Reserve Reserve and you know, technically I don't have rice.

Do they stand there for a little bit for a while and then go, okay.

They just, yeah, they give up and whatever.

This guy's not going to.

It's not worth it.

Wow.

I heard that phrase.

So I'm here to promote Starbucks Reserve Reserve.

If you're in a Starbucks Reserve, just any Starbucks Reserve, any in the country I move around.

So how are supposed to be people, people supposed to come back and find you and give you this high sign?

If suddenly you moved on to Cleveland, it's got to be the gods have to have ordained it.

You don't force things.

You believe in God?

I believe in several gods.

Which ones?

Let's see.

I believe most of the fun ones.

God, like the hyper specific one.

I don't like God.

He's too general.

I said, gog.

Yeah, gog is fun.

Okay.

Gog would be a fun one.

Yeah.

I like guys like, you know, Vulcan.

Mm.

No, they're like, oh, Dumbledore.

Dumbledore.

Yeah.

I don't think Dumbledore was a god.

You know, I'm not.

Okay.

Now that I'm really re-examining the Harry Potter book.

Santa Claus.

Maybe he was a god.

I mean, Gandalf could have been a god.

What were his powers?

That's true.

He's dressed in white.

He's got, he certainly would be a fun god.

I like costumes.

I like names.

I like powers.

So you do believe in a god with a long white beard?

Gandalf.

Yeah, that's right.

Yeah.

Like Wizard Gods.

Booster gold.

I feel like for me, it's a spiritual thing.

I believe in the sea.

And when you go out, you look at the land, the sea, the ocean.

All right, shut up.

All right.

We need to be a sense that we had what mostly was a real conversation.

I don't know.

I think you're.

I don't know.

I don't mind.

I love a very interesting guy.

I think Jason, you should be making a show about this guy.

I hope not.

I hope I broke you all.

He'll smile.

I mean, it's a little sad to look at this.

I mean, you were talking about rats running around the ship.

What's wrong with that?

I guess.

Nothing was right.

It was more interesting is what I'm saying.

I mean, I guess I was very interesting.

I'm glad that when I've had sex with women, none of them have said code alpha.

I guess I'm, you know, retroactively appreciative of that.

I had code beta.

All right.

Well, we need to take a break, but can you stick around, Bill?

I get nothing to do.

Yeah.

I thought that about you.

Yeah.

Well, days free.

Yeah, I thought.

All right.

Well, when we come back, we have a person with exciting news.

This is incredible.

I don't think we've ever had this on the show before.

This is exciting.

We're going to be right back.

We'll be right back with more Jason, more chibi dips, more bill.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

We're back.

We have Jason Wallener, Paul T. Goldman this Sunday season finale on Peacock.

And we also have Bill Smith.

Bill, I think you need a middle initial in order for Jason to be interested in making a show about you.

Good tip.

Yeah.

I'll talk to my adopted biological parents.

I don't have a middle name to find out what your middle name.

So much of my birth certificate was in dispute that a lot of the information was.

Really?

Did your adoptive parents have a different opinion on what your birthday was?

Yeah.

They're like, we do not agree with this birth certificate.

They never said what they thought it was.

They assumed they would come to an agreement and they never hammered it out.

So they like negotiate it?

Mm-hmm.

They negotiated with the biological parents.

Why did they think your birthday was different than what your biological parents were?

They're like, we don't feel like this is an astrological sign.

The birth certificate given was September 22.

And they're like, he doesn't feel like a Libra.

He feels like a Virgo.

We think this is two days earlier.

Mm-hmm.

So just two days.

But I just decided to, once something is skeptical, you don't know how wrong it is.

Yeah, that's true.

So I am?

That's true.

I mean, we also have chibi dips here.

A cry?

What's wrong?

Because he said that I wasn't as interested in the last time.

Oh, you've been crying this entire break.

I know I was trying to tell you all about my life and the bad's running the shit.

And if we didn't even get to that.

The bad's are like a lateral move from the rats last time.

You can't come back the next time and just do like the same thing.

There's a monster running the shit.

You don't have to make stuff from me.

Because you're obviously lying at this point.

I didn't make anything up.

No.

I mean, the bats we know you're telling the truth, but the monster is.

Come on.

Okay, bye.

You need to escalate is what I'm saying.

It's a ship running by Johnny Depp.

Clippy, I found everything you said there.

My Irish is a Caribbean.

Yeah.

He's the captain.

Captain Jack Sparrow.

That'd be funny if in that captain, was it Captain Phillips movie?

Where's it?

Where it should be called Captain Phillips and then Captain whatever the other guy's name was because halfway through he goes, I'm the captain now.

So it's like it's untrue.

It is misleading.

It's misleading, but it would be funny if they redid that movie and then just a bunch of stars and cycle through and was like, now I'm the captain.

And then Johnny Depp was like Captain Jack Sparrow.

That'd be cool.

Okay, yeah, that's what was happening on the ship.

All right, all right.

Well guys, we've come to it.

We've come to, this is extraordinary.

We have never had this kind of hype for a guest on the show before, but he's here.

He's ready to talk about it.

This is the person with exciting news.

Please welcome for the first time on the show, Joey Salza.

Hi, thank you so much for having me, Scott.

Thank you everyone for being here.

I'm very excited.

So here's the thing.

What happened with me?

Just getting right to it.

I don't know how much time.

This guy was talking about walking down the street.

I don't know how much time I had.

This is maybe perhaps my one opportunity at Hollywood Glory and I need to parlay this interest and success.

Let's do it.

So 10 years ago, I was at a movie around the time where Paul T. Goldman tweeted Jason.

Exactly.

I remember it because I watched After Earth, which I assume was a huge movie because after I watched this, I came up with an idea for a musical and I have since then been working on this musical and stayed away from all social media, all internet, all information.

So as I could live like all information, all information.

All aside from the information that was there from when my main characters were alive because I wanted to invest in the same life of my main character.

So I come up with an amazing musical.

I'm already lost.

Okay.

So I came up with an amazing musical, but the characters that it's about lived a long time ago, so they did not have the internet.

Oh, this is a historical piece, right?

Period.

It's someone who's in history, but people don't focus on this person in history.

God, I got it.

That's what's so interesting about that.

And so you've been, you've taken yourself out of society.

Yes.

All information is, so do you, do you know what year it is?

I came out, I came out just the other day.

I tweeted Jason.

He, he blessed have clicked it to.

Well, he has usually a three month response time.

Well, I didn't know he'd be meeting in person today.

Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

I followed up saying that I'm not, I'm normal.

I sent him all my browser history and he could see I hadn't done anything in 10 years.

Right.

So how could that be true?

That's empty.

Yeah.

That's even weirder.

Well, I, I'm here and I'm here.

And so I'm ready to, I'm going to present my musical.

And now a lot of people focus on the main founding fathers, but I am focusing on a different founding father.

This is Alexander Hamilton is the founding father I have chosen to focus on.

He is on that you might be like, why is he on a $10 bill?

I have the, I know.

Yeah.

No, I mean, Alexander, you may not know this, but in the last 10 years, Alexander Hamilton got, got very big in the popular consciousness.

It was like a biopic or no, a musical.

You're fucking kidding me.

In fact, a rap musical, if you can believe it.

You're fucking kidding me.

Yeah.

Yours wasn't a rap musical, was it?

It's spoken word in the sense that it is.

Spoken in rhythm.

Yeah.

Not, I'm not a singer.

Oh, you know, you can't even write music?

No, no.

That's a problem if you're trying to write.

I wrote all these, I wrote the, I wrote the, because usually other people sing it, but in this case, the writer actually performed it as well.

Oh my fucking God.

Just like you, is that what you're going to do?

That's what I was going to do.

That's the exact thing that I was.

Yeah.

You're also, by the way, it was a musical with no white people in it.

Is that similar to yours?

I was hoping, yeah, I was hoping that there would be no white people.

Because you are not white.

Oh, okay.

Oh, no, I'm white.

It's been, it's been a while.

I'm sorry, you're just very pale.

You haven't been out in the sun.

Oh, yes, yes, it's been, it's been 10 years.

And yeah, oh, no, oh, okay.

Well, I was going to present my songs.

I was going to show you everything.

Well, there's been some times since Hamilton came out.

Maybe there's one for another one.

You know, I mean, Armageddon and what was it?

Other movie came out.

Deep Impact came out in the same year.

I mean, there could be room for two.

Yeah, maybe it's not the same.

Maybe we touched on different stuff.

Yeah.

Maybe it was just three pre-fontaine movies all came out at the same time.

Yeah.

No, I think it would say like, love's life.

Now, these two documentaries about the vow.

Finding Nemo and Shark Tale.

Oh, yes.

So thank you very much.

There might still be room.

But yeah, I mean, some would argue that now Hamilton is even more famous and interest is even higher.

Okay.

What's yours called?

My Alexander the Great, not the one you're thinking about the other one, Hamilton.

Is that, that's about, no, no, no, his is just Hamilton.

So I think that there won't be any confusion in the marketplace.

Okay, yeah.

Yeah.

You would just Hamilton?

Just Hamilton.

Can you believe it?

I don't know what that is.

I don't, I can't, okay.

I know.

All right.

Well, yeah, I guess, I maybe, because I hear ham and I'm like, mmm, yummy.

Right.

And then suddenly they followed up with Ulta.

Maybe, yeah, maybe a musical, I mean, I think musical theater is a mental illness.

But maybe a musical about ham could be good.

Okay.

We're already moving on to other projects.

Oh, oh, wait.

Here's your song.

How does a bastard orphan son of a whore, the kind of guy who says, hey, let's plan to hang out.

But then he doesn't say the date.

So then you have to say the date and then you follow up and be like, did we say the date?

And he's like, oh, no, but we should hang out.

And I'm like, how about Tuesday?

He says, I can't do Tuesday.

And I'm like, come on, man.

I'm doing all the work here.

This is where he started and in later songs, I'm going to show you where he gets to.

He's also the kind of guy who says, you smell like shit.

And I'm like, I don't smell like shit.

And he's like, that's my kind of humor.

And I say, that's not humor.

That is just a lie.

That's not who he is.

But right now he is that guy.

And he's the kind of guy that would tap you on the shoulder.

And you'll look at that shoulder and he'll be at the other shoulder.

My point is right now he's not a great guy, but eventually he's going to be a great guy.

And the, the, okay.

Okay.

First of all, I'm sorry that I queued the, I'm, I'm engineering the show.

So I accidentally hit, hit play, but I, I, it's good because I feel like we established the premise.

Yeah, that we didn't need a lot of sufficient time.

But, um, okay.

Okay.

So just first of all, okay.

Musically, okay.

Very similar.

Okay.

Almost identical, I would say.

Okay.

Almost as if this is a karaoke track.

Okay.

But lyrically original lyrically.

Yes.

Yeah.

Right.

The existing Hamilton musical does not get a lot into whether he would or would not tap you on the shoulder.

Okay.

And then if you did, whether that would be like a prank or genuine, I haven't seen it, but I don't think there's a part about him telling you that you smell like shit.

Okay.

Great.

I don't recall it.

Yeah.

I don't think so.

Definitely not.

So music, music's on the first one.

And again, that's just my first, I mean, that's the intro song.

But so you're talking about Hamilton or this is Hamilton talking about someone else.

That's, that's me.

We're setting up who Hamilton is.

We got to start up that he's.

So this is someone else talking about Hamilton.

Yeah.

We're saying that later you're going to be talking about his orphan.

He's a son of a whore.

You know, he's similar to, yeah.

And he's the kind of guy that would touch the shoulder around the shoulder.

Yeah.

And you try to play with him and he's always putting it on you.

And so like, do you really want to hang out?

You know, like, yeah, no, we heard it.

He's not that good of a guy.

You know what I mean?

Right.

Yeah, that's exactly.

Yes.

That's the point of that song.

Okay.

Huh.

So if we got the point of that song, yeah, no, that was very clear.

Kind of shady with his social commitment.

Great.

Okay.

Great.

Fantastic.

So that's one of that.

So I built from there and then there's an Aaron Burke character in my, in mind, I don't know if in there, there are, yeah, it's the other character.

In fact, they sold hats, some say Hamilton, some say Burr.

It's like, who's side are you on?

Yeah.

He's kind of almost the main character in a way.

Yeah.

The second lead.

Okay.

All right.

Well, maybe, maybe that's similar.

But in mind, I imagine that they actually met up well long before the duel.

So this is, this is a little, this is a little something.

Yeah, they've known each other for a long time in the musical that that actually.

Yeah.

But in mind, I pinpoint the moment that they met.

I think this one does too, but maybe it's a different, different time.

I don't know.

Yeah.

I mean, yeah, mine takes place in 1776.

Yeah.

In fact, Hamilton, the one that exists, they start by saying 1776 and they repeat it several times.

Okay.

Yeah.

Well, let me, let's try maybe mine.

Okay.

Mine's different.

Okay.

Yeah.

It's rough.

I can change that part.

All right.

So, so this way, excuse me.

Are you Aaron Burr?

Sir?

No, I'm not.

Sorry.

Aaron Burr is over there.

Sorry.

Excuse me.

Are you Aaron Burr?

Sir?

Well, that depends.

Who's asking?

Well, sure.

Sir, no, just kidding.

I'm not actually Aaron Burr.

No matter who you are, Aaron Burr is over there.

Aaron Burr is over there.

Excuse me.

Are you Aaron Burr?

Sir?

No, I'm not.

How dare you?

Oh, I have a bad relationship with Aaron Burr.

Aaron Burr is over there.

Excuse me.

Are you Aaron Burr?

Sir?

Yes, I am.

Spelt E R I N Burr.

Oh, no.

Aaron Burr is over there.

Okay.

So, there's two songs in a row where things are promising to happen later.

Am I getting that right?

Well, yeah, it happened.

That song.

Again, very musically similar.

In fact, almost identical.

And lyrically starts exactly the same as well.

And then goes- It's just a date though.

That's- But goes- Well, the date and then are you Aaron Burr- You know, again, I haven't seen the popular Hamilton.

Oh, it's popular.

But I'm really enjoying these songs.

Yeah, I thought the lyrics were so good.

You just kept repeating Aaron Burr's over there.

Well, yeah, I can imagine more people doing it.

Is there a lot of people in the place or in the play?

No, in the place that he's looking for Aaron Burr?

Oh, yeah, I think that there'd be like at least like five.

That's not a lot of people.

For him to make the mistake that many times.

I'm sorry, I spent 10 years by myself researching and writing.

You need more people in there.

For him to be going through one by one.

We cut the song before, but one of them actually, he takes out- You think it's someone new, but then they take out the masking.

It's the same person who just put on a mat.

To disguise themselves.

Because when I was- Because when I was saying, Aaron Burr is over here.

Then he's dancing around so he didn't see the mask it put on.

Where are they?

Just like, I'm thinking like a spinnies circle.

I'm thinking like a spinnies circle.

Like a snake that nobody in the scene.

No, I mean where they should be.

Oh, 1776.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

Time period.

Oh, what?

Where are they in like a mask store?

It's like the East Coast, I think at that time, mostly.

Yeah.

I don't think we're getting much specific.

I'll be honest, most of my recent- Because I couldn't use a car and I live far away from a library.

So I would walk to my library and would often be closed when I got there.

And then I would have to walk home.

So a lot of- Why didn't you start walking early?

I'm walking earlier.

I'm like, I've got to get my eight hours.

I'm getting your bargain.

I'm an artist.

So yeah, sometimes I would get there and so maybe I don't have as much research as I would have liked to done in the 10 years.

Okay.

So I don't know exactly the locations.

We'll say they were in a- Does Aaron catch up to Aaron Burr in that scene?

Yeah, at the very end.

Then he says Aaron Burr is right here.

Aaron Burr is right here.

Oh, it's nice.

Yeah.

It's nice.

Yeah.

What do they say?

Do they meet?

Yeah, they meet and then Aaron Burr kind of establishes his personality.

You know, he's like, nah, it's going to stand out.

He's not going to go out on the limb in mind.

You know?

And then Alexander Hamilton is like, I'm going to go out on the limb.

I'm going to say stuff.

I'm going to write stuff.

He writes a lot too.

Yeah.

I have a song about how he's always writing.

That's actually sound five if- Okay.

Yeah.

All right.

Let's hear this one.

All right.

I like to write.

This is different.

I write a lot.

I like to write.

I also like to doodle.

I'm the first guy who made the Stu-C-S.

Remember the Stu-C-S?

That was me.

Wu-Tang symbol.

Also me.

The guy with his nose over the brick wall.

I like to doodle.

What other doodles?

Those are the three I know but also people's name.

Oh, yeah.

I just remembered another one.

I would write my name and someone's crush's last name on my notebook and everyone would think I married to them.

And that would be what I would doodle on my notebook.

And I also had a TI-85 before they were available in my time.

And I made drug wars.

Remember that game?

It was a game on TI-85.

Maybe you don't remember it.

Snoo'd you might write?

That's a game you remember?

I did that as well as doodles.

And I also like to make- Okay.

All right.

Because he writes a lot.

But then- Yeah.

Joey Salsa is your name?

Yeah.

That's right.

And I first and my last.

Oh, got it.

I mean, that's very different.

I mean, yeah.

Yeah.

You have a unique style of your lyric writing where it's like the person's coming up with it while they're saying it.

Yeah.

I think that's fun.

I also like to kind of- I like to come myself like starting confident, you know?

Yeah.

And then Peter and I- Yeah.

Slowly becoming, letting the actors become, appearing to become less confident as a song.

Yeah.

That's sort of how this podcast goes too.

Yeah.

And then I think it's my third song here.

Yeah.

My C-block usually.

Right.

I like how your song makes an assumption over how much the listener is thinking of or regarding the song.

Yeah.

You probably don't know what that is.

It involves the listener.

I like that.

Yeah.

And that's the character.

That's- I'm sorry if you thought that was me, but that's Alexander Hamilton.

No, we understand.

He likes to do it all.

Well, my point is, again, it gets you a little bit later on some, but he writes so much that he's always writing that he even does- He has time to even do other things, but he's still writing more.

This though is my problem, I think, with this song is the historical inaccuracy.

He designs radio games.

And the one that's going on right now, it's historically accurate.

Yeah.

Well, I mean, as far as we know, I mean- Okay.

Yeah.

It's a big fat back in the day.

Yeah.

Well, maybe that's a good thing for me.

Maybe that's a good- Yeah.

That's a way to distinguish yourself.

Yeah.

If it's like, this one's not true.

Like, maybe- Okay, I have one more that I, again, didn't do much research on this one.

This one would be the third song.

Why did we skip four?

Well, we could do four.

It's a 24-minute song.

But my introduction to George Washington- I'm tempted.

It's my introduction to George Washington.

Let's hear three firsts that I made call it Audible on four.

Fantastic.

So in my research, I realized that his wife had a sister who may have also liked him and wanted to answer them back.

Yeah, this is in the regular.

This is my version of that.

And so this is the sister, not his wife, in this song.

And she goes, I want to fuck out when I suck out when I fuck out when I fuck out when I fuck out when I fuck out when I fuck him.

I take my pantaloons down and put my butt next to his butt and we can blow a butt bubble.

Yes, I just didn't end up.

And every hand I, yes, I'm fucking octopus.

And that's the thing I do, cause I even back then we did.

And I will suck him and I'm fucking men.

I'll do the butt thing with the butt ball butt.

That's the thing I invented.

Then don't forget the hand that you're the person.

Wow.

Well, that can't have been in the other one.

Oh, that was pretty different.

Pretty different.

And where was that song taking place?

Is she just sort of saying that to the mirror?

Or is she out on the street?

Yeah, I think that one, she's probably like, you know, yeah, out on the street probably.

Yeah.

I think that's telling passersby.

Yeah, that seems like she wants to blow a butt bubble with him.

And she actually invented that.

And that is maybe, and I don't know if that's historically accurate.

It's gonna find proof of that.

But I, what is a butt bubble that you put your butt next to another butt?

If you put your butt, you'll blow it at the same time.

Is that physically accurate?

Well, oh, yeah, that's, I know.

You've been alone for a long time.

I don't know if this is possible with human bodies the way they are used to.

Yeah, yeah, no.

But anyway, so I am, I'm available to make this musical.

There are, you know, hundreds of more songs that I have.

What was your track for?

What is your track for?

This is a 24 minute song.

Introduction to George Washington is a big hulking character obviously in mind.

So this is introduction.

Big lots of lights.

Lots of lights.

Oh, good, good, good.

Yeah, yeah.

I'm George Washington.

All right.

Okay, this is not good.

I was on board through the four songs.

Is that one?

Twenty four minutes.

Yeah.

He, yeah, he gets eventually gets to like, am I George Washington thing?

No, I'm George Washington.

Ten.

He eventually gets to that.

He thought he was George Washington thing.

Well, he's asking me, he's talking this.

And this is his name.

This one, he is looking in a mirror.

And this one, he is looking in a mirror.

So he's talking to someone else who is himself.

Yeah.

Eventually, like how deep in the song.

That's the end.

Yeah, so like twenty three.

Twenty four minutes of just, I'm George Washington.

Yeah, but it changes a little bit.

It's a little bit.

Okay.

All right.

And they, Joey, Joey, you've wasted ten years of your life because there's another one.

Well, even if there was no other musical about Hamilton, this one sucks.

You're not, you're not good.

You shouldn't not be doing musicals.

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't not be.

Okay.

I'm going to give you a double negative.

When you take that information, it's got that.

Shit.

I'm going to continue on the tree.

I'm going to keep going.

And I believe in myself.

So you got to, you got to take, what do they say?

A million notes to have a yes, right?

Yeah.

A million.

I don't know about anything.

That's a terrible reason.

That's a lie.

Yeah.

But you do have to be delusional too.

Get into this line of work to be.

That's true.

That's a good point.

I mean, I think the existence of the other one is your best asset right now.

Okay.

Like when you say I've got a better Hamilton, I do think people will be interested in better Hamilton.

I think that's what you got to say.

Or if you could just somehow trick people into thinking they're paying to see the popular Hamilton and then work out something.

Yeah.

Maybe it's a L ton or something.

Yeah.

Or you know, you go to a Hamilton production and you open your own little side production.

Yeah.

You like to have people on the shoulder and say, would you like to have a special experience?

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Would you like a special experience?

Okay.

I could do that.

Yeah.

This is a good thing.

Great.

I mean, like Scott locked us all in.

Yeah.

Oh, sorry about that.

Well, look, we are running out of time, guys.

I'm so sorry, Joey.

No, I'm taking.

You gave me a great feedback and I am excited to continue.

I gave you a great feedback.

I did.

But before we go, we just have time for one final feature.

And that is, of course, a little something called plugs.

Yeah.

Oh, fuck.

Oh, plugs.

All right.

Yeah.

That was a weed a with Dr. Sibidow.

Okay.

Thank you so much to we day for that.

Guys, what are we plugging?

Jason, obviously, Paul T. Goldman out on peacock right now.

Adam P got right now.

I'm just going to go to the final one airs this Sunday.

There's six episodes.

You can binge them at this point.

And what if you just took them one at a time?

Like at this point was like, okay, I'm going to watch one a week, even though they're all available.

Yeah.

You feel free to do that?

Yeah.

People legally can do that.

Okay.

Interesting.

They can do anything they fucking want.

All right.

Hey, you're hurting your first.

And anything else you have on the horizon?

No, this is it for me.

I'm done.

You're done.

Congrats.

All right.

And chippy dips.

What are you up to?

Thank you so much for getting my name right.

Finally.

Well, first of all, I would just like to plug our next screws coming up.

It's a salt daddy convention.

Salt daddy convention.

What is it?

What is the salt daddy?

So, you know, sugar babies when the daddy doesn't pay.

Oh, right.

They're called a salt daddy.

Oh sugar babies when the so oh, so the so the sugar baby your sugar daddy, you know, takes care of your pace for all your stuff.

But he's stiff, but he's stiff.

But when he's stiff, see when he doesn't pay for your classes for your art classes for your reading seminars and for your for your blowouts and all that.

He's a salt daddy.

Oh, this is a safe space for all the salt for the salt daddy.

Oh, not spend money together.

Great.

All right.

That's coming up next week.

So get your ticks and then and then, you know, I just like to promote.

And this one little podcast that sometimes I hear called and this book changed my life on CBB presents.

Okay.

That's a monthly as I recall.

Yes, monthly.

And also very cool social media on Facebook.

You can follow at a la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

All right.

Great.

And what was your name?

Bill Smith.

Bill Smither.

That's right.

Yeah, that's who I am.

Bill Smither.

What do you have to plug?

I'm a real low percentage shot.

Yeah.

I mean, you're, first of all, you're as wide as you are tall, which you don't see a lot.

Yeah.

You're like, yeah, I'm like a guest pump.

You're a human chode in a way.

Yeah.

In a way, I am a human chode.

I suppose.

Yeah.

Geometrically.

Yeah.

You're like a stone a jacket.

You're a square.

Yeah.

I am a square man.

Yeah.

Interesting.

I'm a square man with no elbows.

So that is also interesting.

Yeah.

Nothing.

Your arms have just been straight this entire time.

My arms are almost straight up.

You look like one of those drawings that little kids do with just like a square with some legs.

Yeah.

If you don't know how to draw that well and you can just do geometric shapes, you still got a shot at drawing me.

Great.

But other than that, unremarkable.

So if you see a square man with no elbows walking up to you, just give him a chance and see what coffee he has for you.

Yeah.

He may be imagining your death.

Pleasantly.

And you know, not wishing for it.

Yeah.

Just wondering what it'll be like.

Yeah.

And how about also, you know, I've heard some podcasts I like on the old CB Presents.

You can dig into the archives there and here you can't handle the sleuths.

Are the cards already?

I've got a little bunch of archives.

Yeah, sure.

But I mean, there's barely a few months old.

It's sounding like an ancient archive.

Look, I know how the kids are.

You know, something's 10 seconds old.

It's forever ago.

Yeah.

And then I also like a podcast called Screw It.

We're just going to talk about comics.

These two middle-aged dudes who sound the same, who are brothers.

They're middle-aged.

I would call them middle-aged.

I think they're late in their life.

I think that's a hostile interpretation.

They're going to live to be 100, do you think?

I think they're going to live to be well over 100.

They take no risks.

And I think that's in their favor.

It's important.

Closer to death.

And so they talk about comic books and they're examining all the first issues of the Marvel comics right now.

Oh, Millie the Model?

Millie the Model, Ant-Man, a lot of weird firsts.

Okay.

So if you're into that kind of thing.

That's all.

All right.

And Joey Salso, what do you have to play?

Yeah.

Obviously, my musical, it's available because I'm not sure if either of you were takers.

No, Jason, you're not going to produce, right?

Let me think.

I'm going to think about it.

All right.

Okay.

I've seen people here today.

I'm for sure.

Yeah.

Get in fast.

But Jason is out of show business.

Yes.

That's so mine.

We'll make it work.

Also on my one day today, on the internet after 10 years, I did have an Istanbul pun.

Holy shit improv.

It is a...

You didn't look up Hamilton first.

I just had to see what the comedy scene in LA was doing.

Sure.

And the interesting thing about this comedy scene in LA is you can see it from anywhere in the world.

So if you're in LA, you can watch Holy Shit Improv.

Check it out on Instagram.

Or if you want anywhere you can see the shows on patreon.com slash Holy Shit Improv.

Just their lash.

You're not mine.

I take no responsibility.

But just their lash show, they had people like Lisa Gilroy, Carl Tarte, Jacob Boyesock, he Ben Rogers, you know, friends of what I saw people who've been on this podcast.

So you would assume that, wouldn't you?

Yeah.

So check it out.

Holy Shit Improv.

That's it for me.

All right.

I want to plug, hey, the comedy bang bang book is coming out in a few months.

Very excited by you.

You can pre-order.

Go to comedybangbangworld.com slash book or CBBworld.com slash book.

And it's coming out in a few months and we're going to have some special things happening when it does.

And also go to CBBworld and check out some shows.

We got some great shows.

We just had an episode of, hey, Randy just came out with Randy Snuts.

And we just had the, this book changes my life or save my life.

What does it call change?

Change my life.

You don't even know the shows on your own platform.

Sorry.

That's pretty bad.

That's pretty embarrassing actually.

So go to CBBworld.com and you can get all those shows including ad free episodes of this as well as all the archives of the previous.

Those truly are archives and don't go too far back in those.

But maybe as far back as Jason's previous appearance and no further back.

And go to CBBworld.com if you buy a year, if you subscribe for a year, you can get two months of that free.

All right.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

Here we go.

Plug bag.

Wow.

Plug bag.

Wow.

Oh my God.

Becky.

Look at her.

Oh my God.

Becky.

Look at her.

Oh no.

Oh my God.

Becky.

Look at her.

Okay.

Oh my God.

Becky.

Look at her.

Okay.

Little in the middle but she got much back.

Little in the middle.

Oh, back.

Plug bag.

Wow.

Yeah.

Okay.

That was OMG.

Wow.

That's our first remix of the year by King Love Duck Electricity.

So thank you for doing something with that God awful closing up the plug bag theme that we recorded this year.

Really appreciate it.

That one was pretty cool.

And if you have them, send them over to CBBworld.com slash plugs.

You can submit catchphrase submissions and remixes.

We have all the stems up there.

Guys, I want to thank you so much, Jason.

Always great to have you and great to see you in person.

Great to see you, Scott.

Thanks for having me.

And if you want to see what Jason looks like, you are in.

I'm in the show.

So unlike human giant.

This one I'm in.

You're in it.

Constantly cutting to you.

You're constantly gingerly and gently giving direction.

And you seem like you're a pleasure to be on set with.

Thank you, Scott.

And Chibi-Dip, good to see you.

So great to see you.

Are you going to be stuck on land here?

I think I'm going to make it.

And actually you reminded me, Scott, that we have another cruise coming up for celebrities who do get canceled comedians.

Oh, OK.

Wow.

And they come on the cruise for one week and then they come back and then they go right back to work.

All right.

That's just the revolving door of cancellation.

It really is.

So I'm just thinking about that and just thinking about all the good cruises coming up.

OK.

And Bill, so great to have you on the show.

I had a great time.

Thanks so much.

And Joey Sal, so what do you say we get a little bit more of?

Number four, I'm George Washington.

No, let's do number three to take us out.

All right.

So again, you have to remember that she likes that you got in this version.

She likes the sister, which is him who he's married to.

Right.

And so we know that.

Yeah.

So we set up there and then we go like.

I'm going to fuck down when I'm scared when I'm fucking. I'm going to fuck him when I'm sick.

I'm going to take down my pants and put my butt next to respect him.

Well, I'm not going to do that. And then I'm going to suck me and I'm fucking him.

And then I'm sucking in.

I'm fucking in.

I'm fucking.

I want no fucking sucking in.

I knew the bubble button.

That's the thing I meant.

I meant it.

There's sports where I acted out.

Oh, no, no, no.

All right.

Let's go.

Next time.

Bye.

I'm going to fuck you.

Here you go.

You I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a look at the next slide.
