Hey everyone, Scott Ockermann here and you are about to hear a very special live episode of Comedy Bang Bang recorded last month at the Paramount Theater in Austin, Texas.

This is one of the 23 shows that we did in August on our 13th anniversary, Oh No Tour, and we wanted to give you a little taste of what the tour was like because if you are into this, every single one of our 23 live episodes as well as every other live episode are available at comedybangbangworld.com or cbbworld.com.

So you can hear the entire tour, all 23 episodes, you can sign up for a month in our Maximus plan, listen to them all and then dip out.

I don't care, it would hurt my feelings really greatly and I would be very, very upset, but I don't care. I don't care. But anyway, enjoy.

This is a great episode.

I think you're going to enjoy it. This is live from the Paramount Theater in Austin, Texas.

♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Austin, Texas!

♪ You're welcome, my gosh.

♪ Although it wasn't someone saying boo the entire time. Why is it I only hear that?

♪ Austin, Texas, so great to be here in the Paramount Theater.

Love it.

Love it here.

♪ Hear a little feedback. Anyone hearing that? A little just a little hum.

♪ Oh no, it's just some guy going, heeee!

♪ Still hearing it.

♪ Guys, so wonderful to be here in one of my favorite towns in the United States of A.

Austin, Texas.

I believe approximately 12 or 13 years or so ago I started the comedy itself by Southwest here, so this is...

♪ It's wonderful to be back. I love this theater. I've seen so many great movies here.

The one with the train going towards the audience scared the fucking shit out of me.

♪ Oh, right here.

♪ Interesting.

Oh, I forgot. Hey, hey, hey. I forgot to do this last night.

Here we go.

Let's get a catchphrase going.

Open that app.

Jupiter, Neptune, and Saturn, they give me no glee.

Uranus is the only true gas giant for me. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

♪ See someone shaking their head right there.

Does not approve.

Thank you to Call Waiting for Godot for that wonderful catchphrase submission.

Catchphrase superstar.

We have an exciting show for you tonight.

Let me ask, by round of applause, let's do it tonight.

Who here has no idea what the fuck this is or why they're here?

♪ Enjoy your evening.

♪ That's pretty much it.

Comedy Bang Bang is, you know, the last time we toured, it was, we were sort of calling it the show where we talk to interesting people.

We're not doing that anymore.

Interesting people will come out here. We will talk to them.

But I found it reductive. I think we were calling it America's Podcast, and then I realized, you know, we're going to Canada and other places, so that was reductive.

So I think humanity's podcast is what it became.

Now we're changing into humanity's podcast and the Animal Kingdoms podcast.

So, in any case, what you're going to see here is, I'm a host, sort of like a talk show.

I'm a host, we're going to bring some guests out here, we're going to talk to them, and we're going to have interesting conversations.

We have some great guests tonight. Coming up a little bit later, we have a musician.

Very exciting.

We have an actor.

Okay.

And I believe we have, well, I don't want to spoil, our first guest.

We'll be, we'll get to that in a second. But before we get to that, are you guys ready for the most exciting two minutes of your entire fucking lives?

Yeah!

Because it's time for what I call the balcony report.

Now, now, now, now, now. I hear you open the balconies getting very excited.

This is not your time to shine.

I'm not here to say hello to you.

I'm not here to give you a wave or shout you out at all.

The balcony report is merely an opportunity for me to relay to the audience how many balconies are in this venue.

Oh, I know.

Hold on to your butts and glasses.

Because I am pleased to report that the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas has two balconies!

What a high. I'm coming down from that. Oh, my God.

Wow, I'm still hearing it, by the way.

Maybe it never goes away.

Please, please, don't torment me.

Well, we have a great show for you tonight. Are you guys ready to get this started because I'm ready?

Yeah.

I'm going to rearrange the microphones here.

Okay.

Good.

Let's get to our first guest.

He's in the aviation industry.

He's a pilot who famously landed a plane somewhere where it shouldn't have been.

Please welcome Chelsea Sully Sullenberger.

Chezz Lee.

Thank you. Thank you, Scott.

Chezz Lee is what I meant to say.

What did you say earlier, Chelsea?

Chelsea, I think I said Chelsea.

That's all right.

But you must be used to that.

It's an unusual name and, of course, people have given many different variations on it, the most popular being Chelsea.

What other variations are the unpopular ones?

One time I got chingled.

I was getting a situation.

Did that happen?

Was it getting coffee?

Yes, I was getting coffee at the airport.

I gave my name at the counter, of course, Chesley.

I stood there for quite a long time, almost pissed a flight, waiting to hear my name called.

And the gentleman behind the counter looked at me and said, Chingle, come on, man.

You're ruining my day.

He said I was ruining his day.

You know, you talk about walking through the airport and almost missing your flights.

You must be a celebrity in the airport.

You must be walking around giving, like, finger.

Did you hear my Chingle story?

So this was post.

This is post the miracle on that.

It's a miracle on the Hudson.

Which I do not call a miracle.

It was training and competency that landed that plane that day and saved all the souls inside.

Yeah.

Thank you.

How many souls were inside?

You know, I honestly can't remember.

It was a full flight.

So a lot of middle seats?

A lot of middle seats.

I always feel bad for them.

There's a little camera where we can see people get on the plane.

You do?

Like a candid camera?

Like a ring cam?

Yeah.

Like a ring cam, yeah.

We watch the middle seat people and how unhappy they are.

And my heart goes out to them, of course.

I have the best seat on the plane, I like to say.

Yeah.

Or I did like to say I'm no longer an active airline pilot, of course, I've retired.

I did not know that.

Yes.

Why?

Well, when they were going to make the movie Sully starring Tom Hanks, I thought I had a pretty good shot at the roll, so I immediately retired.

They did let me audition.

And you can imagine how humiliating it was that I did not meet the criteria to portray myself on screen.

I have to ask, should I call you Chesley or Sully?

Everyone calls me Sully.

Everyone calls you Sully.

Except for my mother.

What does she call you?

That's a tough pill to swallow.

It is.

I mean, my mother was a gentle soul.

I'm Mr. Deerely.

I'm assuming she's dead.

You know, to hear a barista yelling, chingles, you're ruining everything.

You know, that really, that coming quick.

What, I have to ask Sully, what did you do for your audition?

I prepare two monologues, a comedic and a dramatic.

Did you do 16 bars of a song?

Yes, I did.

I was staying old a beautiful morning in the book.

Just in case, just in case that, you know, maybe it was a musical.

They stopped me singing immediately.

I opened with that and they said that's not necessary.

And then I did a monologue from Danny in the Deep Blue Sea.

And for my comedic, I did, what did I do?

I think it was most of an episode of New Heart.

That's a long monologue.

Yeah, I played all the characters.

I mean, it wasn't the entire episode.

Was it the beginning half or the back half?

It was the beginning half.

I hummed the theme song as well.

I described the various things we were seeing as the theme song played.

What were they?

I don't remember.

How did that go?

Well, there's, of course, it took place at an inn in Vermont and you'd see beautiful footage of Vermont B-roll, they call it.

I learned that as I was struggling for the term, someone mercifully told me, it's called B-roll.

And then you see the stars of the show, Bob Newhart and Mary Fran.

Peter Scolari.

Well, he was later, originally was Stephen Campman.

But I decided to go.

He only lasted one season, I believe.

So I decided to go with the more recognizable names.

Peter Scolari, Julia Duffy.

Tom Poston.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Well, they were the ones in the main credits.

What about...

William Sanderson, I don't believe he was in the main credits.

He was a frequent guest star, but he was not a series regular.

Nor were his brother's Daryl and his other brother Daryl.

CHEERING That was my question, obviously.

Obviously.

So, how did you read you hadn't gotten the part?

I was told immediately.

Immediately.

Yes.

And I said, can I still do my Dany and Z-Blue Sea?

LAUGHTER And the answer was...

No.

Oh.

But my parking was validated and I was given a free bottle of water.

LAUGHTER So, all in all, not a bad day.

It's interesting, when you park on the land, you need to get validated.

But when you park on the sea, you're a hero.

LAUGHTER CHEERING I understand what you're trying to do.

LAUGHTER I appreciate that.

But we call it landing.

Not parking.

LAUGHTER But why didn't you call it seeing?

Because when you're landing, you're on the land.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Because we call it a water landing, and it's very unlikely.

LAUGHTER Not on that day.

On that day, it was 100% certain.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER But you understand that when you take a flight, usually they'll say in the unlikely event of a water landing.

We don't call it a seeing.

You know what I like is when you're watching the safety video, which I hope you do intently.

Oh, of course.

Even if you're an experienced flyer.

LAUGHTER And the masks are falling down from the little compartment above you.

They're dropping.

They're not falling down.

LAUGHTER It's on purpose.

Gravity takes us all.

LAUGHTER Too true, Scott.

LAUGHTER So they're dropping down.

And I assume this would be a very tense situation in the plane.

It is.

But in every safety video, everyone has to act like it's the most natural fun thing to ever happen.

That's to put everyone at ease.

What's funny is the most tense thing that can happen during any flight is not for the masks.

The oxygen and the masks to drop down.

And a lot of people don't realize this.

The most tense moment of any flight is when the instruction on the seatbelts is given and the phrase low and tight across your lap is uttered.

It is unconsciously sexual and everyone feels it.

And there is a moment there where we decide whether or not we're going to continue with society.

Or whether we will engage in a colligula like orgy on the plane.

LAUGHTER In all my experience, people have aired on the side of good.

LAUGHTER Never happened then, the colligula style.

I've heard a tell of it happening, but that might just be flight school, high-jence.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER So, wow, you gave it all up.

And then Tom Hanks.

I mean, look, he's a great actor.

He's won the Academy Award twice.

A terrific actor, two-time Academy Award winner, as you say.

LAUGHTER Has he been ever nominated again or were people like, what the hell were we doing?

I don't know.

Yeah.

Why would they be... you just conceded that he is a very good actor.

LAUGHTER I don't know why the Academy would suddenly say, what the hell were we doing?

LAUGHTER Don't you agree, though?

I think it should be one and done when it comes to those kinds of things.

I agree.

Yeah.

I mean, I'd give some other people chances because, you know what I mean?

Look, if everyone knew that Tom Hanks would never win another award, he would never get cast in anything and maybe you could have been cast in that part.

That's right.

That's also why I've never landed another plane on the Hudson, give somebody else a try.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER That day, let's talk about that day.

That fateful day.

That fateful day with all those souls on that plane.

Hey, thanks for bringing it up.

I never really get to talk about it.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER I'm surprised more people haven't been interested.

Really?

So, you go over to parties.

I go over to parties constantly.

LAUGHTER How many parties a guy like you go to?

I go to four parties a week.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Always...

I get invited to seven.

LAUGHTER Who was having these Monday parties?

LAUGHTER Some very carefree people that I know.

They have a standing Monday party rotating guest list.

I am the only person who's been invited to every single Monday.

And I go to every other one.

LAUGHTER So, you go to parties and people are just like, Hey, Sully, and this never comes up with anyone.

I think it's like, you know, being a very beautiful woman where you assume you don't have a shot.

And people think, he doesn't want to talk about that.

And they're right.

I don't.

Oh, you don't want to talk about it?

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Well, I was just... I was watching that movie when it came out.

I thought it was so interesting because the actual event only took place over the course of 17 minutes or so.

LAUGHTER Yes.

LAUGHTER But it's a two-hour movie.

That's right.

Well, actually, the first hour was boarding and pre-boarding.

Yes.

LAUGHTER Calling the various groups.

Yep.

Some people, they have too many things. They have to check one.

There was all the confusion of, you know, the... Wait, I'm B58.

Oh, wait. No, I'm standing in A58.

That's Southwest Airlines.

Oh, this wasn't Southwest?

This was United Airlines.

This was United?

Yes.

We don't have that system.

LAUGHTER I beg your apologies.

Granted.

LAUGHTER So, but how did they fill up the rest of the film? I'm not really remembering.

Was there like a trial afterwards of like, hey, Sully, why did you do that?

There was a trial.

LAUGHTER People thought I was hot-dogging.

LAUGHTER Some people thought I was trying to impress a girl.

LAUGHTER Was there a girl out there on the Hudson who...

There, there was not.

I mean, obviously, when you're a pilot, you do hear a lot of tales of sirens who will lure planes to the sea.

LAUGHTER It's really any craft.

LAUGHTER Any large craft can be distracted by sirens.

LAUGHTER And you would think being high up in the sky, you wouldn't even hear the siren song, but it is supernatural in nature.

So, of course...

LAUGHTER It's a danger to all pilots and co-pilots for that better.

LAUGHTER Not navigators, interestingly enough.

LAUGHTER Nor the rest of the flight crew.

LAUGHTER So, you're saying that's not what happened?

That is not what happened.

LAUGHTER But there was a, you know, there's a moment during the trial scene where the character of Sully, not played by me.

LAUGHTER The judge, the aviation judge says, Mr. Sullivan, and he's Mr. Sull...

And I, you know, the character cracks him, Sullivan Burger.

LAUGHTER Mr. Sullivan Burger, what exactly did you think you were doing up there?

It's a very...

I wish I could do voices, but you have to trust me that he sounded very angry.

LAUGHTER Right, yeah.

Could you... do you want to give it a try?

Yeah, I'll try it, yeah.

Mr. Sullivan.

Sullivan Burger.

LAUGHTER Mr. Sullivan Burger.

LAUGHTER Mr. Sullivan...

What did you think you were doing up there?

That's very good.

LAUGHTER Much.

And then the character of Sully closes his eyes, and he imagines all sorts of scenarios that take place in the blink of an eye.

Like a last temptation of Christ kind of thing?

It's precisely right.

Yes.

LAUGHTER To me.

In one of them he is doing loop to loops just for fun.

LAUGHTER In one of them he clambers onto the outside of the plane, converts it into a submarine.

LAUGHTER In one of them he drops a tab of LSD and just freaks out.

LAUGHTER A siren scenario was depicted and in one he does have sex with Mary Magdalene in the cockpit.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Cuts to her pregnant in another plane.

I thought that was a questionable choice.

I don't know why.

LAUGHTER Are they implying the plane travel through time?

I didn't understand that.

Right.

Weird movie.

It's a very weird movie.

LAUGHTER Dad's love it.

LAUGHTER You go over for Father's Day.

It's a sure bet someone's going to say that.

Hey, let's turn on Sully.

Thanks, Giving.

I mean, Tom Hanks really is doing a service to the dads of America.

LAUGHTER Bridge of Spies, Sully.

I mean, he's really turning them out.

Making movies for topics they care about.

That's right.

He loves World War II and space.

LAUGHTER Wait a minute.

LAUGHTER This is a good idea.

World War II in space.

LAUGHTER Scott, how would that happen?

LAUGHTER I mean, you'd have to have World War I in space first.

Why?

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Do you think in World War II they retrace their steps for World War I?

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Fought in all the exact same places.

LAUGHTER Wouldn't that be cool though if like Nazis had like spaceships?

Would that be cool?

LAUGHTER Very curious phrase.

LAUGHTER Wouldn't it be cool if Nazis had spaceships?

LAUGHTER Has this show changed since the last time I was here?

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER As a boy, are you feeling a bunch of pride lately?

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER A bunch of fun.

LAUGHTER I just think it would be cool if like, you know, we don't really know where Hitler went to.

We do. He went into the ground.

LAUGHTER It'd be funny if he like came back like the big rocket ship.

It would just be funny.

Wasping away people.

LAUGHTER This is Scott, I'm concerned for you.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER It would be funny if Hitler came back on a rocket ship blasting away at people.

LAUGHTER I beg of you to reconsider the thoughts that you're having.

Think of the words that you're saying.

It's an interesting visual.

You understand the words that are coming out of your mouth?

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER You have such an interesting, even tempered voice.

Thank you.

LAUGHTER You mentioned you sang, oh, what a beautiful morning.

Yes.

Do you, I mean, you're, can you sing really?

I can carry a tune, I suppose.

I wouldn't call myself a, a Luciano Pavarotti.

LAUGHTER Here, let me give you a song.

Sure.

LAUGHTER Safelight, repair.

LAUGHTER Safelight, replace.

All right.

Mm-mm.

LAUGHTER Safelight, repair.

Safelight, replace.

LAUGHTER Pretty good.

I mean, I've seen that commercial a thousand times.

LAUGHTER That's a real earworm for me.

LAUGHTER Soooooo...

What am I doing here in Austin?

Yeah.

Yes.

Scott, I'm glad you prompted me to ask you to ask me.

LAUGHTER I'm getting into the restaurant business.

LAUGHTER The devil you say.

It's true.

Restaurant tour.

Hopefully.

We'll see.

Chesley Sully-Sullenberger.

Yes, Chef.

Yes, yes.

Yes, Chell.

Yes, Chess.

No.

No, Scott.

LAUGHTER What kind of restaurant would a, obviously would be aviation themed, I hope.

Yes, the restaurant itself would be shaped like a jumbo jet.

LAUGHTER You get on there and, you know, someone greets you, they're wearing an aviation uniform.

And they say, show me your ticket.

LAUGHTER Well, that, until the ket part, I was like...

LAUGHTER You were like, what?

LAUGHTER Just didn't know how that was going to go.

LAUGHTER It's a very brief window of time in which you could have that thought.

LAUGHTER It's almost like something out of the movie Sully.

Yes.

Chef.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER So you mime showing them a ticket?

Oh, you have to mime, man.

You don't get a ticket when you come in.

No, that just seemed wasteful.

LAUGHTER It's a restaurant.

Do people's mime skills have to be, like, at a certain level?

I have a rudimentary, I would suppose.

OK.

Basic.

LAUGHTER But you can't just, like, go like this.

You have to be using your thumb and...

You have to pretend you're holding something.

Right.

Yeah.

So basic mime skill.

The gesture that you indicated, it's very hard to describe.

It's just holding your splayed hand out and waving it in a circle.

LAUGHTER Yeah, that's not mimeing.

That's what I'm saying.

Yes.

You won't just take any one.

I guess you have to...

Your skill, your mime skill level depends on...

Do you know what mimeing is?

LAUGHTER If someone were to do this, you would turn them away.

With extreme prejudice.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER OK.

So they come in, they've shown this person the ticket.

Yes.

Then someone dressed as a...

A...

That's when I first started working as a pilot.

And then we can flight attendant.

Yes, sorry.

So the flight attendant will show them to their table, which of course is two airline seats on the plane, side by side.

And the flight attendant will flip the trays down for them.

LAUGHTER From the chairs in front of them?

Yes, exactly.

Are there chairs in front of them?

Yes, from the chairs in front of them.

We thought about doing first class seats, but we thought that's going to take up too much room and...

Unnecessarily divide the diners, so they're all coach seats.

How many seats does the restaurant have?

Well, it's a jumbo, so it has two tiers.

Really?

Yes, and we can fit...

I almost said comfortably.

But we could fit...

LAUGHTER We could fit 250 people.

How?

Yes.

That's a big restaurant.

It's a big restaurant.

Well, I mean, there are restaurants that size, aren't there?

They can fit 250 people.

Well, if you look at a four top, that's four people, right?

Correct.

It's like 60 tables?

60 times stores, 240.

Yeah.

62 tables and a half?

A one top?

A two top?

Two top.

I guess there are restaurants that big.

I mean, in your plaza hotel, or something like.

Yes.

So you're expecting a lot of business.

Well, yes, because when they hear they can always get a reservation.

Walk-ins are welcome, naturally.

You still have to mind the ticket, though.

Right.

And then the cuisine served will be, of course, airline food.

Which, for my money, is the best cuisine in the world.

Do you guys get airline?

I know you're not a pilot anymore, but when you were...

I do have it delivered, though.

LAUGHTER From the...

Does the airplane land in front of your house?

It's...

LAUGHTER It's Uber Eats Sky.

LAUGHTER And a little gyrocopter will...

A guy in a gyrocopter will bring you food from the airplane.

Gyrocopters are cute, aren't they?

They're adorable.

They're the most precious of the air...

air-worthy vehicles.

They're so fun.

They're like two big bug eyes.

Yes.

And like a big bug tail.

I mean, they look like a bug.

They look like bugs.

Yeah.

And, of course, they couldn't be more lethal.

LAUGHTER If you fly in one for long enough, you are certain to die.

LAUGHTER Where do people come from?

They're the motorcycles of the sky.

LAUGHTER But they're so cute.

Motorcycles are not cute, like the gyrocopter.

No, motorcycles are threatening as our most land conveyances.

As you know, I don't care for them.

Cars, buses, trucks, jeeps.

You know, we talked to your brother on the show a while back.

I don't have a brother.

LAUGHTER Maybe he was from an alternate dimension.

Berge?

Another dimension?

Another dimension.

LAUGHTER Never mind.

So airline food...

LAUGHTER And served in airline portions.

LAUGHTER And, of course, the flight attendant, when the people are settled in their seat, the flight attendant will ask them, have you dined with us before?

We do things a little differently here.

LAUGHTER You order off the menu and we bring you that thing.

LAUGHTER Right.

Every other place is doing tapas these days.

Yes.

Small plates.

I get it.

Great for sharing.

I'd recommend you need five of these and four of these.

Yeah.

And they all cost the exact same thing as like when you go into a regular place.

The thing about tapas that really bothers me is it forces you to be in a position of a weak and helpless child, asking, will this be enough?

Will this be enough?

LAUGHTER And then the server is forced in a position of mommy saying, if you're hungry, we can give you more.

LAUGHTER It's very infantilizing and you're not going to get that at my restaurant.

LAUGHTER Are there seats near the exits?

There are seats near the exits, yes, always.

Do you need a verbal, yes, that...

Yes, we go through that whole thing.

LAUGHTER And the question is a little different.

The flight attendant will ask, if you sit in the seat, do you agree to have a great time tonight?

LAUGHTER Does anyone ever say no?

They do, but then the server says, come on, just play along.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER So, can I ask, what is this place called?

So, all these crash pad.

LAUGHTER Now, I know what you're thinking.

You know what I'm thinking?

I debated using the word crash.

LAUGHTER Because that's not a word that I associate with Sully Sullenberger.

No, and it's certainly not a word you want to associate with any pilot.

LAUGHTER But any landing that you can walk away from is a good landing.

And the plane is permanently grounded. It's not a real plane anyway.

LAUGHTER Oh, it's not.

It's constructed to look like a plane and also has a jet engine.

LAUGHTER And could be, it could take off at any moment.

LAUGHTER So, it is air worthy.

It is air worthy and there will be a flight crew in the cockpit of the restaurant.

LAUGHTER And if I give them this signal, they will begin taxiing and then take off.

My dream is to have the restaurant situated on a very long strip of highway so that if they need to, they can't take off.

Why would they need to take off?

Scott, there are some things I'm not sure that I'm privy to tell you.

Did that sound right that sentence?

No.

I'm privy to tell you.

No, you're not allowed to.

I'm not a liberty to develop.

That's what we're going to do.

Liberty is such a great word.

Agreed.

LAUGHTER Do you know that song that has it in the...

Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.

Oh, yeah, of course.

I've seen that commercial a million times.

Can't get it out of my head.

Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.

LAUGHTER What about the guy going, Liberty, Liberty?

LAUGHTER I forgot about it.

You know who I like is that emo from the Liberty Mutual commercial.

Although that other emo is trying to steal his thunder, the one that's always fucking with the camera.

Emmanuel.

LAUGHTER But you know, I read recently there's another emo that saves someone's life.

This is someone's Instagram story.

I don't recall all the details and I rather wish I hadn't brought it up.

LAUGHTER I can do some further research on that after my segment has concluded so I can update you all on this heroic flightless bird.

LAUGHTER Obviously flightless birds are my favorite because they will not interfere with the jet engines.

LAUGHTER Is it only because obviously famously the one that got into your...

Infamously.

I beg your pardon.

Was the goose.

The goose.

The goose was loose.

LAUGHTER The goose was loose and into many, many pieces.

LAUGHTER The goose's structural integrity had completely broken down.

Courtesy of a jet engine which it should have known better than to fly into.

Unless of course it had a thirst for human death.

LAUGHTER But that goose was thwarted that day.

Is it any small consolation that at least the goose is dead?

Of course it is.

But only the smallest of constellations because so many geese yet roam the earth.

LAUGHTER But with my restaurant I aim to take that number down by a few.

We are going to be the first exclusive goose restaurant.

LAUGHTER We will serve nothing but goose dishes.

Goose every which way you can imagine.

LAUGHTER And whose responsibility is it to catch these geese?

That's not something you can just go to the market and buy.

Well actually you can't go to the market and buy a goose but that's not enough for you.

That's not enough for me.

And I do have a cadre of specialists.

This is their one mission and it's also their one joy in life is to destroy geese.

To bring them down and to bring them to me so that I may cook them and serve them at my restaurant.

Are they killing the geese before they get to you or are they bringing them alive?

Are you like dead or alive?

Dead or alive, yes.

If they do bring a live goose I will kill it.

LAUGHTER We will go into the octagon and it will just be me and the goose.

LAUGHTER I will strip to the waist the goose has a fair chance.

LAUGHTER But what I like to say is we're fighting on my terms now.

LAUGHTER Couldn't the goose just fly away or not in the octagon?

Mmm. There's a roof on it.

You have a roof on your octagon?

Of course. For just such an occasion.

It's nice.

It's pretty nice octagon.

Where'd you get it? Can I demon me asking?

You know it was a prefab, it's one of those kits.

Yeah.

But the roof was my idea.

LAUGHTER Have you ever had goose chili?

I can't say that I have.

Come to Sully's Crashpad.

LAUGHTER Have you ever had a PB&G?

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER LAUGHTER Wow, what a menu.

LAUGHTER Basically it's any food you can think of but with goose.

LAUGHTER Well this is exciting.

And when's the opening?

The opening hopefully will be next month.

I just need investors.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER It seems a little like the timetable is a little too compressed.

I don't think so because once I get the investors, which should be the easiest part, then I will build the plane.

LAUGHTER Hire the staff.

You know, ground up all the geese.

LAUGHTER Have you hired the staff of the goose killers?

Oh yes.

That team is still working.

Oh yes.

Yeah.

Are they on your dime at this point?

Yes they are and happily so.

LAUGHTER It is my great pleasure to know that there are geese being slaughtered.

LAUGHTER This time it's personal.

LAUGHTER It never wasn't Scott.

LAUGHTER Well good luck to you Sully.

I mean, I don't know that I can invest.

Maybe someone in this crowd is willing to invest.

I mean, it sounds like four people are willing to invest.

Yeah, how?

I'm well on my way.

How much money do you need for this functional airplane?

A half a billion dollars.

LAUGHTER Sully Sullenberger everyone.

CHEERING Sully Sullenberger.

CHEERING I'll go over here.

CHEERING Stay right where you are Sully.

I will.

LAUGHTER Very exciting to have our next guest here.

How do you feel about music and musicians in general?

CHEERING Can I answer as well?

Yes, please answer.

Love it.

LAUGHTER Well, our next guest is a hip hop pioneer.

CHEERING Is it Cal Solomon?

LAUGHTER Founding member of the Sugar Hill Gang.

LAUGHTER You know about Cal Solomon?

He's one of my favorites.

You like Cal Solomon?

I do.

It is unfortunately not him.

All right.

LAUGHTER He's one of the original hip-hoppers with that real hip hop.

Please welcome to the stage M.C. Sugar Butts!

CHEERING CHEERING CHEERING I said...

Get on up and get on down!

Sugar Butts is in your town.

Now you are you, and me is me.

Hello everybody, Salins, GodD.

CHEERING We in Austin T.

M.C. Sugar Butts, where did you see you?

There's a piece of wood on the stage.

You want to get rid of it? What do you want to do?

I'm going to throw it in the audience.

Please don't.

Hopefully it hits somebody in the eye.

CHEERING Nice harm.

I put a little baseball in the 80s.

When I eat my country fried steak, I like it with gravy.

CHEERING M.C. Sugar Butts, just to let everyone know who is unfamiliar with you, your story.

Who is that? Who is that?

Stand up. Don't shit. Chat.

CHEERING I don't think we need you to stand up if you don't know who M.C. Sugar Butts is.

Or shit, or chat.

Shit, shit, shalet, whap.

CHEERING Some of the time you do about half and then you just quit.

Well if they don't know me, why should I finish?

That's a good point.

Shit, shit, shalet, whap.

Oh my head is a baseball cat.

Ruh!

Gentlemen, so sorry to interrupt.

Let me know when you're ready to hear the emu story.

Mmm!

Liberty, Liberty, Liberty, Liberty.

Ruh!

LAUGHTER What do you say M.C. Sugar Butts?

Are you ready to hear the emu story or do we need to get your back story out?

Well, my best friend, Kruger's name is Freddy.

About this emu story? I am ready.

CHEERING Dateline London.

England has two new unexpected celebrities, a 42-year-old chef and a massive emu.

Who in it, who inadvertently teamed up to help catch a driver who fled a crash scene after narrowly missing pedestrians and causing extensive damage.

Dean Wade said he heard a loud screeching noise near his workplace in Wilshire, southwest England on Monday and raced out to see a cheap careening before smashing into the front of an empty shop.

In an interview with the Washington Post on Wednesday, Wade, who has been working at the Old Bell Hotel in Malmsbury for only two weeks, said he could see the driver who appeared drunk, was getting ready to back away from the scene.

A female passenger had left the vehicle.

There's no way you're going anywhere, Wade told the man, who he said was swaying and staggering all over the place.

He said the man was determined to escape, heading off on foot, though unable to run fast due to his physical state.

Wearing his slip-resistant rubber kitchen clogs and chefs overalls, Wade chased the driver for 15-20 minutes through bushes, allotment and gardens before the pair ended up at an animal sanctuary.

This was when the real confrontation began.

I could see this massive emu, Wade said.

I'm six-foot tall, and it was bigger than me.

Wade said he could tell the bird, which was surrounded by its offspring, was likely to spring into defense if anyone intruded on its enclosure.

Mate, don't go in there, Wade warned the man, who he said ignored his advice, replying, I can fight crime.

Sorry, I don't have my spectacles on, I can fight emus.

It even crazier thing to say, before heading into the animals pit, where he was repeatedly pecked.

It was stabbing his body all over, Wade said, causing the man to curse and unsuccessfully attempt to kung fu kick the animal away.

The bird kept stabbing at the driver who eventually gave up, fled the pen, and headed toward a river, while Wade took the opportunity to flag down a nearby police car.

There the emu exits the story and it stops being interesting to me.

But I will say, one final note is that the picture they use in the article is not the exact emu, but just a stock photo of an emu, and they note that underneath the picture.

Wow.

That sceph should have cooked that bird.

Raw.

What do you think of that?

I mean, pretty crazy, huh?

Well, the man said he wasn't running that fast.

What did he chase him for 20 minutes?

It s like no.

He had to have been going a reasonable speed.

Remember, he was in his rubber chef's clogs.

That rubber chef clogs move wrong.

I'm a dog.

MC Sugarbutt, this is what I wanted to bring up.

What is that?

For people who don't know MC Sugarbutt, who stand up right now, sit your pants, do a little dance, or city dance?

You were one of the original people who started doing hip hop back in the early 80s.

That is correct.

Something happened.

What?

Well, you know your story better than anyone, better than me, perhaps, but you fell into a coma.

Well, let me tell you about me, Scotty D.

Fell into a coma in 83.

And you just woke up a few years ago.

It s been a few years now, Scotty.

Pretty much used to things at this point.

It s all the new styles of hip hop you ve grown accustomed to, you ve listened to.

But I refuse to relate to those little kids.

What do you think, I mean, it must be such a shock to the system to hear, like, you know, hip hop the way you used to do it, and now people are like, The real way, the real way.

Yeah, the different fucking days.

I did adopt profanity.

But now people are out there going like, Burt and stuff behind everyone.

Do it again, or do it again.

Please, Scotty, do it again.

Burt!

Thank you, Scotty D.

But do end that for me.

Wait, what was the accident that got you into that coma?

Wake up?

I was...

I was at an evangelical event.

And I caught the Holy Ghost and fell and hit my head.

That was it.

That s right.

Could have been so many things, though.

I mean, your mind...

Could have been so many things.

My mind is a pot of stew.

Carrots and potatoes and rose stew.

See, beef, bros.

Eli Ross.

That's my favorite, do the dud what he does.

I don't know if every dude that does what he does, he's the best at it.

He's an actor, correct?

No, sometimes.

What else does he do?

He's a director.

Oh!

What do he do?

Hostel.

Right?

I'll see.

Someone said no.

Is that not right?

He did direct Hostel.

I saw that movie.

It was really gross.

I like hot butter on my breakfast toast.

Yuck!

Hot butter jelly and jam, too.

I'm going to go.

So, M.C.

You know, needless to say, you woke up, the whole world was different.

There had to be new inventions like the Roomba.

The Roomba?

From the Roomba to the Toomba?

My new job is to clean up graves and a grave yard with a Roomba.

From the Roomba to the Toomba is the company name.

That's your new job.

Fire me for all your graves, clean the knees.

What was the message?

And some sugar butt yet.

We might have the same question.

Sure.

What's the messiest grave you've ever seen?

The messiest grave.

I'm so glad you asked, selling burger.

The messiest grave I've ever seen was right here in Austin, T.

Full of shit.

Someone just took a big dump on a grave.

When you die, sometimes you relieve your bowels.

And in a hotel with really soft towels.

That seems like a very fast turnaround from death to grave.

Got it in there.

Shit lives forever.

But the Roomba got it up.

It got it up.

In the rhyme.

Do you need me to say that guy?

Over.

Why, Joe, you say under rhyme, nothing rhymed with up.

Come, shop, whoop, whoop.

Are you all right, empty sugar butt?

I'm about to grow up.

So this is an exciting new business opportunity for you.

A lot of people wanting investments.

How much do you, I thought this business was already going.

You've cleaned up one grave at this point.

Here's how it works.

It's got a D.

I bring you on and you bring three.

And then they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, come on selling some burger.

Dance with me.

I bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three, and they bring three.

So it's a pyramid scheme.

What?

I do clean pyramids, which are graves from the Roomba to the Toopa.

What's the biggest pyramid you've ever created?

And also what's the smallest?

The biggest was in Miami.

The smallest was in Egypt.

That must have been a big Miami pyramid.

Huge.

Was this recent pyramid news?

People don't know about it.

I had to clean it up before they screamed and shouted it.

Wow, okay.

So this is a good business.

I mean, you own this.

Great business.

I own it, then you own it.

Are you sad you're not a rapper anymore?

I mean, this seems like your first love.

Wrapping was the first thing I had ever done in my life.

Oh my God, he's went into a reverie.

It was all I knew how to do.

He's having a flashback.

Oh, get on up and let's go down.

So there's nothing from a crash to play into the crowd.

That's not true.

MC's sugar bud.

Oh, excuse me.

He crashed a plane into the sea.

Closer.

You seem to have gone into, as Scott said, a reverie and your voice completely changed.

And it seemed that that was not a place you wanted to stay in.

It's impossible.

Impossible.

So was wrap your first love?

Wrap was the first thing that I ever had learned to do.

From the moment I could speak, I could arrive.

Like Dr. Seuss.

Oh, oh, oh.

Ooh.

Sally, you make me shake, can you make me quiff-hood?

You crashed a plane into a river.

There we go.

This is just factually incorrect, I am.

It is?

It wasn't a crash.

It was a water landing.

Oh.

Which are highly unlikely.

Sally, Sally, that makes you the best.

In my company, would you like to invest?

I'm looking to get some capital myself, so I cannot help you with this time MC Sugarbup.

Maybe you guys could team up, though, with this business.

I mean, maybe many customers are bound to die from goose poisoning.

They will have gravestones that will be diffaced.

You know what goose is like to shit?

Graves.

Well, I wish you would put out an album or something.

I mean, hip hop seems to be what you care about.

I mean, I feel bad for you that you're an older gentleman now.

Excuse me, Scotty D.

I am only 33.

You got it at the coma years.

Nobody don't.

You're in your 70s, obviously.

Oh, I beg to differ.

I beg to differ.

The dead bodies get stiffer.

Swiffle.

I was so excited when you saw the Swiffer as a new invention.

I could ride with differ.

I use that word all the time.

Finally, finally something to ride with a word that was unrivaled before 1997.

When I wasn't around.

I googled it.

Oh, in Google, that's a huge thing.

You know, when you were still around.

Encyclopedia Britannica.

My favorite driver is Danica.

Patrick.

Hockey.

See, you're so good at this.

I just feel bad that you're...

I feel bad you're doing this business that's obviously going to fail.

Whoa, whoa.

Me?

You.

Both of you.

Who me?

I mean, you're both that bad business ideas.

Who?

Us?

Who, us?

Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry to say.

I mean, look, I didn't say it while we were talking solely, but I mean, this restaurant...

It's hard enough to launch a restaurant.

This one is just doomed to fail.

You definitely did not mention that during our conversation.

And you, I mean, cleaning up graves?

How often are people shitting on graves that this is a necessary thing?

You'd be surprised, Scotty D.

Every day I see a third times three.

So four clean up jobs a day?

For all the graves?

Have you seen a cemetery?

Mary and Barry?

Don't call me Mary and Barry.

My favorite man of all time.

I mean, he was great.

He was good.

Yeah.

So much crack.

Not enough of you ask me.

I thought it was just enough.

I just...

We have a real goldie like situation here.

For crack.

I know I'm supposed to be sort of neutral sometimes, you know, as a host, but I just can't let you guys ruin your lives like this.

I mean, you both have so much going for you.

I mean, MC Sugarbud, you're a great rapper and Sully, you landed a plane once.

I will not dignify that with a response.

What about you?

You gonna dignify?

In real patronized Z Scottie D.

Leave me and Sully.

Leave us be.

You want me to go?

Be you S-I-N-E-S-S for the win.

That was a ride.

It spells business.

You seem surprised you right.

I am sweating.

All right, MC Sugarbud, everyone.

It's in my eyes.

Maybe we can get you a towel of some sort.

A towel?

Give me that one.

That's his curchy.

You can't just...

Did you sneeze in it?

I did.

I don't want that one.

Sugarbud.

What?

Sugarbud.

You put sugarbud into my brain.

It goes...

Finish it.

I'm pouring sugar into my coffee.

That's plain.

Leave the rhyming to me.

We need to get to our next guest.

You thought you were last?

I thought that was it.

You were going to go home?

I thought you were going to invest.

I'm not going to invest.

I'm sorry.

You can't expect me to invest in something.

Are we?

We're not?

I don't think the first...

I'm hearing a bit.

You haven't been...

All right.

Let's get to our next guest.

What do you say?

I say, yay.

He's an actor.

I mentioned he's an actor.

He also is an educator.

He teaches at Hamilton High.

Please welcome to the show Todd Padre is here.

Thank you.

Finally.

The Todd has come back to the Bang Bang.

For the first time.

Oh.

Are you out of breath?

What is it?

It is hot in Austin, Scott Ocherman.

No, no, no, no.

Are you hella yeah it is.

Sorry, I'm a little sweaty.

Little.

Yeah, I'm a lot sweaty, Scott Ocherman.

I mean it is hot out there.

It is hot out in these streets.

You have the dampest hands I've ever encountered and I escorted hundreds of people into a river.

And I cleaned this from Graves.

They expect you to clean the piss from them as well.

Everything has to be clean, Scott.

Which part do you clean the piss from?

The gravestone of the dirt.

Do you have to like wring it out of the dirt?

I gotta wring it out of the dirt.

It makes the grass go bad.

Really sad.

Cause the people are dead.

Are we-are dead?

Is somebody moved? Fuck you.

I am so happy to be treading the boards here.

Mr. Padre, it's so great to meet you.

You and I have never met.

Yes, we've never met.

No, we've never met despite my incessant emails, booking emails, auditions for the show that I've sent in unsolicited.

Right.

You're an actor?

I'm an actor, come theater teacher, come in pants sometimes.

I thought it was- You bring up a good question because I've always assumed it couldn't be pronounced come.

But is it QM?

Oh, like loud A? Like in that sense?

What? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

No, it's for people who are the loudest ejaculator in every class.

It's a degree and gets to speak at the college graduation.

Magnute.

Some people are magnet to come loud A, some are some are come loud A. I'm a lot of come loud A.

You- You're a teacher and an actor.

I'm a teacher.

I'm an actor.

I am the only living razz-gott recipient.

I have a razz-y for television, film, theater and music.

Wow.

Yep.

Um, proud feminist.

What does that mean to you?

Um, I'm nice to ladies.

I carry tampons with me.

To- to- for what purpose?

Well, you know how you always kind of see a woman go into another woman sometimes and be like, Hey, sorry, can you help me out here?

As a male feminist, I say they shouldn't have to just ask women.

So if I come into a room, I'll say ladies, I have a tampon also.

If you need one.

No questions asked.

But you know, some men just aren't thoughtful like that.

You know, it costs money and stuff like that and I'm fine to pay for it and I'll just tell the women, you know, I'm on Venmo or whatever and- How much do you charge?

Well, it's per box, which all four of us probably know how much a box a tampon costs.

Of course.

Of course we do.

Somewhere between five and five hundred dollars.

Then of course flip between we know how many come in a box.

So you do that math and then- Thirty-eight.

Say it straight.

I thought it was Q-minibox.

So you and people, you and some other teachers at Hamilton High.

Yes, we were fine.

That's called the Teachers Lounge and we discuss.

Yeah.

Yeah, you guys, I don't know what the auto quality of your mics is in the audience.

So I had to put my mic up to the audience.

Yeah, thank you for hearing it.

So everyone here can hear how popular the show is.

Yeah.

So you teach drama.

I teach drama.

I live drama.

I mean life is dramas isn't it?

T&T.

I know drama indeed.

I got the movies also, but that's FX.

You have the deal with the movies?

No, I just got the movies.

You remember FX got the movies?

FX has the movies.

Okay.

But I'm here in Austin.

Arby's has the beef.

They've got it.

They've got the beef.

How do you feel about Ving Rames doing those commercials?

I have mixed emotions.

Dude, who are you speaking?

Is this a general question to the panel?

Yeah.

I know solely has issues with Ving Rames as far as your history together.

Yes.

He wanted you to throw the plane into the Hudson for a fee.

Yes.

He was still in character as Don King and was trying to get me to throw the flight as it were.

I refused.

I also advised him to change his name to something not so close to wing.

Because those are sacred or?

It was just an idle threat.

He's a very big man.

Is he tall?

I don't know.

He's wide.

He's four-foot ten.

Not a lot of knowing about Ving Rames.

No, he remained shrouded in mystery.

He doesn't even have his Emmy anymore.

That's right.

It was buried with Jack Lemon.

With Jack Lemon?

You heard me.

He famously gave it to Jack Lemon.

Oh, and then they buried me.

He was there in the crowd and then Jack Lemon died immediately.

In the audience.

And then a seat filler at me, I do that sometimes, wasn't certain when Jack Lemon was sitting dead in the audience as this is seat I have to fill.

So I dumped his body onto the ground.

And this is the only part you remembered from that night.

For which night?

No.

The seat filling situation.

I feel like you genuinely don't know.

Um, was it 9-11 also?

Pass.

You wait, you can pass?

I'm using one of my passes.

Alright, you only have 240 left.

Be careful.

That's how many tampons come in the box.

But I arrived in Austin today because, um, as a theater teacher, as a man who knows people, who knows the human condition, I've been doing a bit of a touring show now that the world is back open again.

And everything's safe.

Everything's safe.

100%.

It's all good.

I have monkeypox.

So I don't have to worry about monkeypox.

I have Covid.

That's why I'm so sweaty.

I have longest Covid.

I didn't know it was a competition.

Thankfully Guinness awarded me longest Covid recently.

Um, and, uh, but we're out here, you know, and it's hard.

We were in our homes for two years.

We didn't know how to talk to people once we were out here, you know.

We didn't know how to, um, I want to sit back down.

I don't have much more to say on that one.

Oh, yeah.

That was a dramatic stand.

I just felt really.

Yeah, I mean, it really felt like something was going to happen.

It's incredibly hot out here.

Sorry.

Wait.

You're carrying a roll of toilet paper and you're back of your sweats?

Yeah, I'm really hot.

He has a handkerchief.

You didn't make fun of him.

Cause that's classy.

Toilet paper's assy.

Alright, I guess you got me.

But you know, we're out here and we, you're.

Stop saying we're out here.

What do you mean by that?

We're, um.

I'm out here.

He's out here.

What do you tell us why you're here?

Uh, what's so?

Yeah.

Don't you, yeah.

Okay.

We're out here, Scott.

And, and you know, you're expected to just be normal again.

And through my theater training, I want to train people how to be out in the world again.

You know, and to be comfortable.

And so I'm doing a touring show called Act Normal.

And it's, it's all about these little moments we find in the post-COVID world.

You know, and it's, it's, it's, it's Tony Robbins meets Barack Obama's master class meets Tom Cruise in Magnolia's Awesome Speeches meets Abbott Costello meets Frankenstein.

I have to ask, are they, are those earlier things meeting the movie?

Abbott and Costello meets Frankenstein?

Or are they meeting both Abbott and Costello and Frankenstein?

It's them meeting Abbott and Costello while they're meeting Frankenstein.

And so it's, it's the vibe of the show is like, oh, we've interrupted Abbott and Costello meeting Frankenstein.

What's the social graces here?

You know, what, I know Abbott a little bit so I hug him.

I barely met Frankenstein.

Is that a fist pound?

And it's just preparing people through all the things I know through theater.

Right.

Breathwork, Feldenkrais, Alexander Technique, Meissner, Stanislavsky, Stan and Ollie.

So what, can, I would love to see a demonstration of these.

I'm so glad you asked, Scott.

I really needed you to ask.

Okay, well, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do an exercise.

Two of you, I need two of you to sit across from each other and this is.

Okay, why, why don't, uh, sugar about it and, and solely, why don't you guys just sit across from each other?

And this is, is, is, you know, it's so hard to connect with people anymore, don't you think?

It's so hard to connect with people anymore.

Look, someone in the eyes really get to know them anymore, don't you think?

When you're talking to somebody, it's hard to connect with them anymore.

I just look them in the eyes and get to know them, don't you think so?

I do believe so, yes.

And so this exercise is all about connections, about eye contact, it's about comfort.

And it's about finding yourself comfortable with somebody else that you barely know.

You understand?

Yes.

Okay.

So this is, I'm gonna give you a line from one of my plays and you're just gonna repeat it back and forth to each other.

One of your plays?

Yes, I'm a playwright, Scott.

Okay, what's this one called?

This one is called Child Thief.

About?

A person who takes children.

Because it could have been a child who...

thieves.

A child who thieves.

As a verb, yes.

No, that's my play Baby Back Robbers.

I want my Baby Back Robbers.

Why don't you lay down a baseline for us?

Excuse me.

Why don't you lay down a baseline for us?

Okay.

This is perfect for this exercise because this is a line from the play.

So you're confronting the child thief.

So you're saying I want my Baby Back.

And you're just repeating what you hear.

Back and forth until the words give you new meaning and it's about the connection, not the words.

Does that make sense?

Yes.

Okay.

MCSB, are you ready?

Yes.

CSS, are you... oh, yeah.

All right.

On my cue.

And...

Action.

I want my Baby Back.

Now, this is great so far.

I don't want to interrupt you.

It's great, but you're not doing it right and well.

So...

And it's awesome.

It's lovely.

I do this every day, so I'm obviously going to be perfect at it.

You know, when I teach improv classes, I'll stop a scene and then I'll do it to show them how to do real improv.

That's a great strategy.

So you're saying the words the same emotion behind them all the time.

I want you to open up a little bit.

This is why you didn't put that role, is you're giving me no emotion, no heart, you know.

And I can say that because I'm the guy that the Liberty Bivity thing is based off of.

That happened to me in a Liberty Mutual audition.

I said the name of the company wrong 400 times and they used it and they used it and they mocked me with a guy equally as good looking as me.

So same thing a little more emotion fellas okay. Just feel the words I want my baby back.

I want my baby back.

I want my baby back ribs.

That was powerful.

Let's take a look at that menu.

Let's see.

We can exit full screen.

We can go back.

Can't go forward.

I could have been real dicey there.

Seeing those open tabs.

I'm glad they closed all my tabs.

I was using it beforehand.

Who is Scott Ockerman?

What is comedy bang bang?

You spelled it with the nature.

Which word?

Nobody saw that.

I saw.

You just saw two men who have never met each other having a connection.

A connection is made.

You are unbelievable.

Rod, a great wavelength here.

You do with your.

This is it in my class.

I welcome everybody.

If someone says something, say it out loud.

If you know the lyrics, repeat after those lyrics.

Get into the song together.

You know each other a little more.

That's what's killing us in this country.

We are dying out here, Scott Ockerman.

I don't know what your point is.

Everyone is dying of COVID.

You go to a movie and talk through the whole movie anymore.

People can't understand what you are saying if you wear a mask.

No, yes.

I'm being very so funny.

I'm being so funny during a movie.

Nobody hears it because I'm forced to wear a mask.

I'm a Stux member.

Someone else saw an garage that was paid for.

I deserve to be treated properly when I go to the movies.

I'm a journalist.

I wrote the Nicole Kidman thing.

Do people have AMC theaters out here?

Do they know what we're talking about?

It's all Alamo draft house this out here.

They should play it at the Alamo draft house.

It's iconic.

I didn't know you wrote that.

That's incredible.

I wrote the original version for myself.

I'm sorry this person is yelling something.

It must be urgent because they just kept yelling it.

What did you say?

Okay.

What was the original version of this?

AMC?

Yeah, that's what we're talking about.

What was me?

You'll portraying the role of Nicole Kidman?

Yes, hi.

I'm Nicole Kidman.

I love movies, dude.

You love movies, dude.

Here's the thing.

People are so mad when they can't go see a movie in theaters.

Tom Cruise, my husband sometimes before.

He dresses up funny so he can see a movie in the theaters.

Is he dressing up funny?

Just disguising himself wearing like a half glass.

Tom Cruise, disguising himself, that is a funny image whatever he's wearing, right?

He's using the MI technology.

Yes.

What technology?

MI, Mission Impossible.

Oh, he is.

Oh, with the rubber mask?

Yes.

The whole thing, he gets into a movie by climbing the building like he didn't do by.

On the ropes?

Yes, scary.

All his own stunts.

Did you know that?

I do have my own stunts too.

What's where the queen shouldn't piss out of graves?

You got a call for a second team when that's happening.

That's got to be somebody else.

You shouldn't be doing that type of thing.

Would you like to join the team?

I mean, does it go on IMDB?

It could, I guess.

IMDB is where all of the actors' resumes are.

Ooh.

Ah!

Oh.

Eee!

We were talking backstage and Sugar Butt was like, I was watching so many movies at my hotel, I wish there was a way I could know who these people were.

See it?

How I said it.

Let me tell you something that's not going too well.

I can't figure out these actors in my hotel.

Beautiful.

And so I said, you know, you just go to IMDB and look it up.

And I told you that right before.

And now we mentioned it again and it's like you weren't listening to me at all.

Because I wasn't.

I was not.

Austin is really hot.

Yeah.

But that's what, you know, now Sugar Butt is going to remember because he's done the exercise.

I mean, what issues have you had post-COVID?

You're out at a party, at a dinner party, at a party palace, a party city.

Well, there are some societal norms.

Just the other day, I met someone and they reached their hand out to me.

It was someone I'd never met before and would never see again in my lifetime.

We both knew that.

And he reached out his hand and I looked at it and I said, well, I'm not going to do that.

And did you not feel, I know that you, a man of the world, was adequately prepared to handle that moment.

But some people, they're not used to all of those social interactions.

And that's what my class teaches.

We put you through acting technique, through all of those situations.

I call them improvisations or skits.

And we do situations that you might be scared of.

Okay, so like what?

Should we do one right now?

Absolutely, Scott Ocarim.

Okay, I need two people up, two people up here.

Why is it only two people?

Let's do three, yeah, let's do three.

Okay, okay, so...

And we're wandering around aimlessly, I take it.

Okay, so...

This is nice, just feel the space a little bit, feel the space, feel yourself.

Now, if you yourself here, be yourself.

Okay, we lost Sully, we lost Sully.

We lost Sully, he felt the space too much, we lost Scott.

Okay, we're feeling the space a little too much.

Okay, you feel the space here?

Oh, feel the space.

Nice.

And now, if you're in character, what body part does your character lead with?

Let me see what your lead with, you know?

Is it from your head, or you a thinker, and you walk with your head first?

Is it from your heart, you know?

Are you emotional?

Is it your gut, you act on your gut?

Is it your sex?

What are you lead with again?

I'm just doing my feet.

It looks like everybody picked feet so far.

Like my feet are feet.

Yeah, everybody's picking feet in different ways.

Great.

This is really special, this is really something.

Yeah.

Okay.

I feel like I'm in the Lion King on Broadway.

Now, at some point, when you make eye contact, someone greet that person and will be in a situation.

So this situation is, one person wants to handshake and just react to how ever you would react in that moment.

We'll talk about what happens, because I don't want to direct you too hard.

Each of vegetables drink your milk.

No.

No words being shared between Sully and M.C. Sugarbutt, a belight handshake in on with there.

And of course M.C. Sugarbutt in line skating while Sully does a bit of a march.

And Scott Ockerman in the Ministry of Funny Walks in a few...

Oh, we're getting a hee-hee out of Scott.

Now Scott is shamin' on as he walks across the stage.

And Scott...

Scott and Sully are face to face with each other, both.

But Scott might be Michael Jackson, he might be Michael Jackson in a personality.

Scott Ockerman who just saw Michael Jackson's music video and is excited.

Let's see what happens.

Would you like to shake my hand?

I wish I could, but I'm a filthy goose.

Shmo.

And scene, wow.

What did that do for us?

Now that you have experienced something so far out as Michael Jackson meeting a dirty goose...

and being rejected by it...

What is there to be scared of?

Geez.

And that is something that was so beautiful that you did, Sully Solenberger.

Is you?

Burger.

No, I'm full. Thank you.

Alright, that's our show, everyone.

Pearl Tarts!

Dan Lipperts!

Paul F. Tuckins!

Mr. Scott, we love you!

We love you, you're such a great crowd, we really love you.

We love you, you're such a great crowd.
