â™ª What's up hot dog? The retirement!

Hello, I'm Scott Ockermann, your host.

This is a very special episode of CDR Radio.

When I say that, of course, I don't mean that we'll be dealing with some serious social issue like bone marrow cancer or sexual abuse.

No, this is special because it's fun.

This is Comedy Deathray Radio's Best of Show for 2010.

The CDR Radio Awards. We want to welcome you.

We will be playing the best clips from all year, and special guests will be dropping by for the entire show to claim their prizes, their trophies voted on by you, the viewers!

Or listeners, sorry.

You have made Comedy Deathray Radio one of the most downloaded podcasts in both this country and abroad, slightly.

And we want to celebrate that fact today, and maybe this is the first time you've ever listened to the show, so let me just explain it a little bit to you.

The best way it could possibly be described would be that it's like biodegital jazz, man.

Oh wait, no, no, that's Tron.

Sorry, that's Tron.

This show is partly a talk show or a chat fest. Mainly, CDR Radio is a comedy program.

For the most part, we don't talk about comedy. We actually try to do it.

Usually it starts off with me interviewing someone from the stage or screen, from Ben Stiller to Zach Galifianakis, Weird Al Yankovic, John Ham.

So you'll hear a collection of those folks popping up and some of the clips you'll hear on today's show.

Meanwhile, because of the open door policy here at CDR Radio, other guests will drop by and sometimes forcibly interrupt the proceedings.

But basically we play games, we fuck around, we have a lot of fun, and speaking of fun, we should get to the fun.

Great segue, can go segue's.

Speaking of fun and the enjoyment of it, of said fun, let's get to our first guest today.

Hold on a second.

Yes.

Hey, out of my way, I'm forcibly barging into this.

No, just like you predicted.

No, you're not a forcible interrupter. You have been on the show more times than anyone this year.

A whopping 14 appearances this year.

Is that so?

Yes.

Really?

Yes.

Who am I again?

Yeah, well, let's introduce you. You've played a variety of characters if I may pull back the curtain from Ice Team 2.

Just this one.

From Ice Team 2, Cake Boss to Gary Marshall to Danny Glover, the F stands for many things including funny and friend Paul F. Tompkins.

Oh, thank you. Thank you for silently applauding Engineer Doug.

Engineer Doug, please don't make any noise when you applaud him.

He hates that, it distracts his performance.

It's because of my cap and my plaid pants, he thinks I'm a golfer.

So he's trying to silently clap.

Clap.

Oh, welcome to the show.

Scott, thank you for welcoming me and you're welcome to me.

Would you thank me for something so I can...

Scott, thank you for having me.

You are too.

You're welcome. Thank you. I feel doubly welcome to the show now.

I welcome to you the first time and then I thank you.

That's right. And now you're welcome.

All right, for those of you keeping Sally at home.

We've thanked each other for approximately 12 times a piece.

And we have been welcomed 24 times a piece.

Paul, it's been a great year.

2010.

Scott, it sure has.

I can barely hear you over there.

What's that? Speak up.

Okay. How's this?

My mouth is on the microphone.

You've been on the show 14 times.

That seems to me like once every three weeks or so.

I'll take your word for it.

I'm not good with math or geography.

Okay. Where are you now?

Over here.

That counts.

That counts?

That counts on a map.

You've been a friend of the show.

You've been, like I said, sometimes you're here.

He's got shut up for a second.

Oh, dude.

I want to say that the show has been a friend to me.

Whoa.

Yes.

I want to thank you for that.

I want to thank you.

And I want to welcome you to the show.

You're welcome and thank you for welcoming me.

We'll try to get a few more of those out before the end of the program.

I bet we will.

Paul, if people have never heard the show before, where do they know you from go?

Oh, let's see.

My first big break was Mr. Show with Bob and David.

Oh, that was more on it at that point.

That show featured a lot of conjunctions.

I remember people, it had prepositions, conjunctions, people were very excited about it.

It had some proper nouns.

It had some titles.

And then I've done a bunch of things after that.

I was on real time with Bill Maher briefly.

I was in a tenacious D TV show.

And then a new chapter of my life, A Little Sit God by the name of DAG.

That's a whole autobiography, I think.

I think like John Hausmann who has like four autobiographies about each chapter of his life, DAG will be a separate autobiography.

What if I did write a book all about my experiences on DAG?

I would read that book as would many of the listeners of this program.

Many?

Maybe overstating it.

So DAG, Best Week Ever, you were the host of...

That's right.

And now where are you?

I am doing a bunch of stand up.

I'm also developing a show for Comedy Central, a sitcom starring me.

And I'm writing it with my good friend, television producer and radio host Tom Sharpling.

Oh, that's fantastic.

We're working on that monk thing.

That's right, Laid of Monk.

And host of the Best Show on WFMU.

Yes.

And we're writing that right now.

That's fantastic.

It's very exciting.

Is that a put pilot?

Meaning, are we guaranteed a pilot?

Yes.

We are writing the script first, and then we're seeing if we got a pilot.

I feel pretty good about it.

I feel pretty good.

You're a star.

You're someone that people can rely on to get big ratings.

So I have a feeling that we'll be seeing that on the air in MMXI.

Well, both of those things are not true, and now you've made me worry about the future of this project.

I did not mean to do that.

I feel like you're being delusional on my behalf.

Have confidence, sir.

I will, sir.

Well, thank you, sir.

Do not maybe thrash you with an inch of your life with my ivory tipped cane.

You're a lot like the one of the guys in third base who carry around an ivory tipped cane with a knife.

That was not the first time I was in it.

Yes.

Engineer Doug like that reference.

The MC search was the in third.

He was, but that was not the man I'm thinking of.

I'm thinking of Pete.

Who am I thinking of?

Engineer Doug.

Pete.

What a great hip-hop name.

That's quite a hip-hop name.

Pete.

Hey, I'm Pete.

Yo, yo, yo.

I'm Pete.

All right, Paul.

Let's get right to it.

All right, Scott.

You, let's lead off the award show.

I dare you.

And our series of clips with this, the first category of the day is best Paul F.

Tomkins performance.

As it should be.

We devoted an entire category to you.

And let me just give you a little spoiler.

You're going to win.

Oh, this is great.

You're about to win an award.

This is a squeaker.

All right.

Let me tell you what the nominees are.

The nominees are iced tea causes crib death.

The perfect one.

Thank you very much, everybody.

You did not win for that.

No, that I don't mean to spoil it for you.

You're welcome.

You did not win for that.

We have Andrew Lloyd Webber's glamour push.

Ah, thank you, everyone.

Again, not the winner.

You are welcome once more.

Cake Boss predicts Scott's future, my future.

Now, this.

At one point during an episode, you predicted my future.

It was the very first appearance of Cake Boss.

Yes.

All right.

Cake Boss is special cake.

I guess you made a special cake at one point, probably the droid cake.

They're all about.

I know they're all.

Yeah, I don't know.

Maybe that's what he does.

That one got the least amount of votes and that may be because it wasn't specific.

Yeah, the categories is a little confusing.

All right, but I will tell you what the winner is with 33% of the votes.

John Hamm and John C. Riley's acting off.

Sure.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

John Hamm had a great deal to do with that.

I think people, I remember when we did that episode, people said that was an instant classic and one of their favorite episodes ever.

Because of the presence of John Hamm.

Yes, of course.

All those bits I did by myself.

He adds a little star luster to everything he does.

He really does.

That is shiny.

He's very shiny.

Is he really?

He's got some power on that.

He does need some bass.

I would imagine the makeup budget for Mad Men is just astronomical due to his shininess.

His shininess, the rest of that cast is not exactly dull either.

They're a pretty shiny bunch.

The shiny bunch.

Of course.

His favorite waster.

The episode we're talking about is of course episode 34.

Of course.

It actually was the Christmas episode of last year.

Let me say a little something about the voting.

We have people vote for these categories on earwolf.com and we open it up for the first year.

We open it up from Thanksgiving of last year to Thanksgiving of this year.

That's so fair.

Not the calendar year of 2010.

No one got to vote on this episode last year so we wanted to include it.

Yes.

You sound like you know all this information.

No, I do.

You don't have to be so goddamn smug about it.

You're welcome.

Thank you.

This is from episode 34.

Basically you were playing John C. Riley.

John C. Riley has not appeared on the program.

No, it can be revealed.

So let us get to the clip.

We want to set it up a little bit.

You guys were both on the Christmas show and at one point you got into an argument I believe and we decided to have an acting off where you would find out who was the best actor.

Did that happen?

Was that planned or did that happen kind of fun?

No, nothing.

By the way, nothing we do on this show is ever planned usually.

I mean we have the barest of outlines sometimes.

That is true.

No, but because everybody is very skilled with improvisations and so forth.

But that one I can't remember.

None of this was planned.

That was just came up and I think I got the idea at one point to have an acting off and we found a Shakespearean monologue I think.

Yes.

And we punched it up on the computer.

During a break.

We were listening to a song and then we were frantically searching for.

Because this was live.

That's when it was streaming live on Indie 1013 which we are still on Indie 1013.

We want to say hello to everyone out there.

Buddy, not live anymore though.

You pieces of shit.

You pieces of shit who love live things.

You are out of luck motherfuckers.

Greetings from the past.

Alright, so let's get to this clip.

This is the acting off between John Hamm and also John C.

Riley played by Paul F. Tonkin.

You may hear.

Thanks for including me.

In the clip for the best Paul F. Tonkin's profile.

I said also let me reveal my process.

I said also so I could just put a little more time in between me searching for the other guests so I needed another word so I added also to it.

But now I found the other guests.

You may also hear James Domian, Nick Kroll, Doug Benson.

They were all there so if you hear some other voices those are the people who are there.

Let's hear this from episode 34.

This is the acting off on Comedy Deathray.

I would love to see an acting off.

You know between the two Johns.

I would love to see who's the more powerful actor.

Give us a monologue right now.

Give us a monologue.

Alright, so we have this monologue up.

Now who goes first?

Do we need to flip a coin?

Oh he got first.

I like it.

John Hamm goes first.

This is a monologue from As You Like It and let's hear the powerful acting of John Hamm.

Actor extraordinaire from St. Louis taught acting to young children in St. Louis and then this is going to lose a little bit on the radio because what you're not seeing is my powerful brooding.

Your physicality is important to a character.

That's starting right now.

However, I've closed my eyes when I watch Mad Men usually because I'm doing laundry and I do that with my eyes closed.

It's hard to do.

You're folding this thing.

What character are you going to be reading for us?

Adam.

Alright and he comes writing in on the sleigh.

Thank you sleigh master.

And begin.

What?

Young master.

Oh my gentle master.

Oh my sweet master.

Oh you memory of old Sir Rowland.

Why what make you here?

Why are you virtuous?

Why do people love you and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant?

Why would you be so fond to overcome the Bonnie Prizer of the humorous Duke?

No more to yours.

Your virtues, gentle master, are sanctified and holy traitors to you.

Oh what a world is this.

When what is comely and venomous him that bears it.

I think we have a winner.

I think he won.

What?

Hold on a second.

That was definitely the best.

That was really the best.

Everybody shut the fuck up.

That was the best one.

Oh it's you shut the fuck up.

I see Riley.

You're not my commanding office.

Listen.

John.

The stage is yours.

Thank you.

Let me.

He rides in on the sleigh.

I'll take off my sweats and of course I'm wearing a leotard.

Go.

What?

My young master.

Start whenever you're ready.

Oh my.

You know what?

Listen.

You better respect the craft.

You got to respect the craft.

This is not done.

This is not done what you're doing.

But it helps if we get Will Ferrell and Adam McCain holding your hands.

Oh.

Man boy.

Oh.

Maybe if uh...

Matthew Wiener.

What?

Don't say guy of it.

Just say Wiener.

Hold this.

It's funny.

What?

My young master.

Oh my gentle master.

Oh my awesome master.

Oh.

You memory of old sorrelant.

What?

What make you here?

Why virtuous?

Why do people love you?

And wherefore are you gentle?

Strong and awesome.

Why would you be so fond?

To overcome the awesome prize or of the awesome Duke?

Your praise has come to swiftly hold before you.

No you're not master.

This is some kind of man.

The greatest thirther than butter's enemies.

No more than yours.

You virtue's gentle master.

Awesome and holy traitors to you.

Oh what a world is this?

When what is awesome in Venom Sim?

The bear is it?

Look I'm crying real tears.

Look at how I'm crying real tears.

Oh my gosh get a close up on this.

Yeah yeah I don't use one of those...

Men's all things and I don't...

Yeah thank you.

Let's get a microphone right by those tears.

Yeah yeah yeah.

Can you hear them dripping into a pan of basin?

Wow.

That was a giant tear.

Yeah I have a tear basin that I carry around.

A tear spittoon.

A tear you were?

Is that...

Wait is there a room?

Is it?

That was it.

Anytime I cry real tears that's the end of the...

Really you just stop in the middle of a sentence.

Alright so now we'll...

Everyone who voted for John C. Riley.

Raise your hands.

I voted for John C. Riley.

No well thank you but still.

I vote for John C. Riley.

What?

Who is that?

No wait wait wait wait.

John C. Riley.

Your hand is up.

John C. Riley you're saying you voted for me for the acting contest?

I did.

I voted for you.

I thought you brought a lot to that and made it your own.

But I've treated you so poorly.

That's okay man.

You know what?

You're the being the bigger guy here and I feel like a real jerk.

What?

Are you crying real tears John C. Riley?

I am and I...

Is it okay if I use your tear basin?

Of course it is.

We're both actors we got to stick together.

So what if you just work exclusively in television pretty much and I'm on the silver screen on the Broadway stage?

Well opposite people like Philip Seymour Hoffman doing a version of True West where we switch roles overnight.

That's a lot of track to play.

Well that...

I voted for one Hummon.

So so...

Do we have a winner?

Have you guys been...

You know what?

I almost said...

You know who the winner is?

The winner is...

The audience.

They got to hear some great action.

True.

Yes.

That still makes us laugh.

Yeah.

You're welcome.

Ah boy.

Great clip.

Thank you.

You're really good at these clips.

I feel like I'm great at clips.

That was the first clip but I can already tell this show is going to be maximum funny.

I think so.

Thank you so much Paul for dropping by the awards and for winning something.

Scott it was my pleasure.

Thank you for warning me something.

You're welcome.

You're welcome too.

Thank you to all the fans.

You're welcome.

All the fans.

So who are welcome?

I'm a fan so I'll take that one.

Well right.

You're welcome to the fans if you would accept my welcomes.

And I look forward to more great times with Comedy Death 3 Radio in 2011.

Oh.

So you will be back.

No.

I mean I'm going to listen to it.

Okay.

I hope somebody says funny as me but I doubt it.

Alright Paul see you next year.

Alright so long Scott I love you.

Good night.

We are up to our second award now and this is our award for Best Performance.

Best Performance.

This is a celebration of the performing arts here at Comedy Death 3 Radio and this let me read the nominees.

We have the first Harris Whittles phone corner.

First Harris Whittles phone corner.

Boy we all remember that.

We have Brett Gellman Bob Odenkirk and Scott Ockermann read Injustice for All.

Hmm.

Alright.

We have Tig Nataro's Taylor Dain story.

Brett Gellman's I-Brain story.

And Jason Mazzucus and Patrick McMahon's Limerick readings.

Alright.

Those are our nominees and let me open up the envelope.

With 35.9% of the vote Brett Gellman's I-Brain.

Whoa.

Amazing.

Hey Brett.

Hey Scott.

You're here to pick up your award huh?

Yes.

Let me explain to the listeners exactly what's happening.

Okay Brett you came on our show a year ago and in fact I believe it was January 4th maybe.

Our first show back and you said hey I've been working on my prose.

I've been writing a lot lately and I have a short story that I want to read.

And the short story that you read to us eventually resulted in me banning you from the program for several months.

Yes.

So we're going to hear a little bit of that and so people can hear exactly what we're going to hear.

And hear exactly what that short story sounded like.

Do you have anything you want to say to people before they hear it?

Yeah I do.

Remember there is an addiction.

There is an affliction that people are sick with and that is the addiction to technology.

Alright well let's hear that clip then.

This is I-Brain from episode 35 here on Comedy Death Ring.

It's entitled I-Brain.

I-Brain.

This is Brett Gellman with I-Brain.

In the year 2060 an old rich man gave a lecture.

The iPod, the iPhone, the iBook, the ITV, the iCar, the iplane, the iRifle, the iCrawave Oven.

Yes you all own these.

You all love these wonderful apple products however you do not actually know true love.

No you don't.

You think you truly love my creation, sleek metallic smoothness like they were your own children but you don't.

For you have not yet experienced true love because you have not yet experienced what I am about to give you.

Everyone in the audience looked at each other with confusion.

What could he mean?

What could good old Steve possibly mean this time?

As they looked into each other's bewildered eyes Steve Jobs, the wealthiest and now the oldest man alive continued his lecture from the podium.

You may think I've given you all I can give.

You may think this is all there is to get from the good folks at Apple but I think you'll find you're quite mistaken.

Prepare people.

Prepare to receive the final thing you shall need to become the complete human being you've always dreamed of being.

Ladies and gentlemen I present the iBrain.

At this Steve Jobs took out what seemed to be a white smooth football helmet but without the face guard.

Everyone looked around at each other.

The iBrain.

What was this?

Had old man Jobs finally gone insane.

That's right folks it's the newest sensation from the good folks at Apple.

The iBrain comes equipped with technology that man has been waiting for since he first slithered out of the mud.

Imagine that something that does everything all other products have ever done in the history of Apple but inside your brain.

I'm talking music, movies, high speed internet, phoning, flying and much much more.

Plus the iBrain comes equipped with a brand new function never before provided by Apple.

Thinking.

That's right folks.

The iBrain does all of your thinking for you.

Why have to make decisions yourself?

Why have to remind yourself to pay those annoying bills?

Why remember to tell your wife and kids happy birthday when the iBrain can do it for you?

The iBrain does everything and then some.

So buy one today folks and give your own brain a chance to rest for a change.

I just want to interject something here.

When you said it wasn't comedic you were dead on.

This is really just.

It's very serious.

It gets more serious.

What i'm trying to say is it sounds like you're trying to be funny.

It sounds like you're trying to be satiric in some kind of safe way.

No.

No i'm not.

I'm not trying to be.

I just want to continue.

Do you want me to continue?

All right.

By the time the old man had finished his speech the audience was already up in arms cheering as if they had just seen Jesus himself emerge from heaven and hand in the key to happiness.

Old man McWashington was weeping he was so thrilled.

Little Timmy Spurling tugged on his mother's blouse.

I want one mommy.

I want one.

And in the back of the auditorium stood a reasonably attractive man and a reasonably attractive woman.

Watching the hysteria objectively as if they were staring into some twisted human aquarium.

The man looked to the woman.

Wanna go Eve?

The woman looked to the man.

Sure Adam.

Adam and Eve walked out of the auditorium and down Broadway.

It was still legal for them to be outside.

Mandatory curfew please.

Mandatory curfew wasn't for another three hours.

How about that eye brain, huh Eve?

Adam said as he checked his pockets to make sure he hadn't lost his keys.

I guess I'm not really into technology.

I guess it could be cool though.

Eve wasn't really interested in talking about the eye brain.

She was currently searching her own brain to try and remember what polar bears looked like.

It had been so long since she had seen a picture of one and even longer since they had gone extinct.

I mean think about it Eve, a thingy that does all you're thinking for you.

Imagine that I tell you.

Sounds pretty damn good to me.

I think I might buy one.

Yeah, but do you think you should so soon?

Eve still wasn't too interested in Adam's chosen topic of conversation.

She was now trying to remember if she had bought enough dehydrated broccoli to hydrate for supper that night.

I guess you have a point there Eve.

It's usually good to wait to buy something, at least it's until it's been released in its second generation, but at the same time, Apple makes really high quality products.

Whatever said Eve, as her and Adam approach her apartment door, he's now fully focused on an entirely different topic from any of the ones she had been thinking of before.

Well this is me, she said, as Adam stood staring at her blankly.

Wanna come up and fuck?

Why not reply to Adam?

And then walk through the door, please, please.

Alright.

Oh no, I went to build it up.

The first one off with her clothes was Eve.

Her perky tits said hello to Adam like they were friendly next door neighbors.

She dripped with anticipation of what Adam had concealed in his tight blue jeans.

She got in her knees and unzipped him.

Yeah, she was right again.

It was a big hard cock.

Eve then looked up at Adam giving him her dough like fuck me eyes.

I guess this is for me.

Adam's still staring into her eyes, licked his lips almost as if he was preparing to do to himself what Eve was about to do to him.

What?

Yeah.

That's for you baby.

Merry Christmas.

Eve smiled her luscious lips mere milliseconds away from wrapping around his veiny shlong.

What?

Happy Hanukkah, she quickly giggled and then proceeded to get down to business.

Eve sucked Adam's cock ferociously.

Look at it, he contained all the unknown.

Please, this is about what's going on right now in our world.

Like in it he contained all the unknown secrets of the universe.

Adam's face clenched in ecstasy.

God, she's good, he thought.

Nobody gives a BJ like Eve.

Eight full minutes went by.

Eve would have kept going too, but Adam had to stop her.

What's wrong, she asked.

Nothing's wrong baby.

It's just if you keep sucking me like this, I'm definitely going to come.

And I don't want to do that yet.

Oh yeah?

What do you want to do instead?

Eve asked with a sweaty grin.

Adam mirrors her grin.

Oh, here's my...

Oh, just a little something I like to call Bob-in for pussy pews.

Eve liked the sound of that.

Bob away you dirty fuck pig.

Adam picked Eve up and threw her on the bed.

He spread her pink legs and immediately shoved his face in something even pinker.

Eve then proceeded to let his tongue dance on Eve's clit like barishnikov.

Swirling and twirling with the greatest of ease.

He painted her fence with not one, not two, but 47 saliva coats.

Oh God, please.

I know it's not, it's discomforting where we're at right now.

Just then Eve slapped him across the face and without warning him took Adam's rock hard beef loaf and shoved it into her hot hairy oven.

Oh God.

At first Adam teased her just dipping in the tip of his head.

And then after a couple of tip tests of the old twat water, punched his whole hard meat thermometer deep into her tight lower mouth.

Oh God, come on.

Eve screamed in ecstasy.

Yeah, that's right.

Fuck me good.

Fuck me good, Bozo.

Put your balls in my bucket and get 50 points.

You goddamn perverted clown.

Yeah, Bozo.

Fuck me right.

Adam grunted in between thrusts.

Why do you keep calling me Bozo?

Because you're a clown.

You're a cock clown.

Now go over to my dresser, put on your clown makeup and cock me some more.

You slip, you sick molesti fucker.

Adam looked at Eve's dresser and sure enough there was clown makeup on top of it.

He got off off her bed, walked over to the dresser and quickly did what his master had commanded him to do.

He spread the white and red paint on his face in such a way that it looked like he had been crying for about two hours.

How's this he asked?

Perfect you fucking clown.

Come over here and funny fuck me.

Adam wacked.

Adam walked back over to the bed.

But this time Eve threw him down on the bed.

He might be a clown, but I'm a cow girl.

Eve slid on top of Adam's backwards and slid or slit down his pole.

She then proceeded to bounce.

Buck and Bronco, buck and Bronco take your ride on the Bozo, Buck and Bronco.

Adam was starting to lose control.

He knew it would bust his load any second.

Her hot fat ass bouncing on his dick like that.

She was enough to make the Pope want to fuck.

Eve was starting to climb X2.

Her moans and groans quickly transformed the screams.

There was no doubt about it.

She was on a one way trip to orgasm town.

I have a surprise for you.

She said as she helped with pleasure.

What's that asked Adam trying to last just a couple more minutes?

I'm a squirter.

Just then Eve stood up off of it.

Adam, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Your interjections are just that Eve stood up off of Adam's cock and proceeded to spray him with gallons and gallons of her sweet savory honey juice all over his six pack.

This was too much for Adam.

To match the vagina squirts with a boatload of hot veneilages.

It was so thick it looked like he had a crust toothpaste factory in his nut sack.

Then after the fruits were fully juiced, they collapsed right beside each other covered in nothing but each other's musty, sweat and jit.

Wow.

Talk about a fuckathon said Adam.

Feeling like a cross between Ares the God of War and Fabio.

Huh?

Yeah, said Adam.

I'm sorry, yeah, said Eve.

Her maimin started to drift.

She laid their thinking.

She looked at Adam.

She had never noticed before, but she suddenly realized that he had a really nice face.

A really, really nice face.

She liked Adam.

He was cool.

You know Adam, I've given it a little more thought and I think you should just go ahead and buy yourself the eye brain.

Yeah?

Yeah.

If you want it, you should try it.

Adam thought about it some more.

Wiping the clown makeup off of his forehead.

You know?

I think I will leave.

I think I will.

I have a question.

Brett.

Yes.

Andy Future will all broccoli be dehydrated?

Alright, we're up to our next award.

This is for best returning character and when I say character, I just mean like an odd person who drops by.

Our show, if you've never heard it before, quite a cast of, and I say cast with a K, quite a cast of crazy, also with a K, characters with a CH.

Drop by the show a lot and we have some, let me, let me say who the nominees are.

The nominees are El Chupacabra, Hule Houser, Jesse Ventura, Bob Dooka, Meryl Schindler, Ice-T, Cake Boss, Sir Dame Andrew Lloyd Webber, Bobby Bottle Service, and Little Gary.

Those are the nominees for best returning character and with 29.9% of the votes, Bob Dooka wins.

Oh my lord.

Oh, Scott.

Hi Bob.

What an amazing honor.

I didn't realize that 29% could be a winning score.

If in most cases it is not.

But we had so many on the ballot that I think they all just split the vote and you ran away with it.

But I am not complaining, I will take it where I can get it.

Let me explain who Bob is if you've never heard the show before.

Bob is married to my mother for how long was it Bob?

Seven beautiful months.

And those were seven months when I was 33 years old and you've constantly been trying to reconnect with me.

And I don't like to think of it as a reconnect as it is to stay connected.

Uh huh, uh huh.

So you came back into my life earlier this year and...

And I am not going anywhere, buddy.

Yeah, I promise never to leave you again.

Listeners took a fancy to you partly because you're so, I mean I hate to throw words like this around but you're so pitiable.

But you just agree to that.

Oh sure.

Alright, well, while you're here Bob, if I could, we want to also get through another category here which is best Bob Dooka performance.

You've dropped by the show many times this year.

Oh my goodness.

We have a category directed solely to you and we have some nominees decided out of your many appearances here.

And would you be surprised to learn that with 63% of the votes, the winner is the list of ailments.

Ah, Gloria, did you hear that?

She did not, she does not listen to this program.

It's a little too dirty for her.

Well, you know, I knew your mother would be quite dirty at times.

Okay, please, I don't want to hear anything about that.

Alright, so...

Important for a woman to both be Madonna and Horr in a marriage.

Alright, let's hear this is a list of ailments, best Bob Dooka performance on Comedy Deathray.

You know, one of the things that Joseph Campbell taught us is to give names to our enemies.

Right.

And I've been diagnosed with several disorders and syndromes.

Okay, I'd love to hear them.

And I'd like to say some of them now just as a way to again give them less power and to let maybe one of your hundreds of listeners know that they're not alone.

Because I'm sure that other people suffer from this as well.

Alright, well go ahead and read some of that list then.

It's not a long list I would think, so yeah, be my guess.

Alright, our next award is best Andy Daley performance.

Best Andy Daley is a friend of the show.

You know him from Yogi Bear of course.

And he's come on the show several times and done very wildly different characters who have one characteristic that they have been in the show.

One characteristic that they all share.

Which we may find out a little bit about when we announce who won.

Let me read the nominees we have of course Ben Alterman.

Bill Carter who I believe was the trainer to the stars.

Bill Carter.

Patrick McMahon was our Irish limerick teller and August Lindt, a German fellow who had some very unusual ideas.

And I can announce with 46.5% of the vote August Lindt is the winner.

Oh my goodness hello Scott.

Oh August you're here to pick it up.

Yes of course I came here I was told that I won an award I said I don't care what it is where is it and then I can't believe I'm back here.

No one told you you won the award.

You were told you were nominated for this.

Okay yeah that's right it was a nominee and so put on black tie.

Yeah come on.

I put on black tie.

Yeah can you thank you so much for wearing that black tie.

Sure.

People wear it around their neck but.

Yes I've got it around my arm here just tying off a vein.

It seems to me like you're hiding some sort of other arm band.

Oh come on stop it now just because I'm German doesn't mean I'm always a Nazi.

August I have to admit that I when I heard you won we were wondering if you would even be alive to accept this award.

Yeah that's right because then last we met I was on my way to trying to commit some of the suicide.

Well we don't want to exactly say what happened to you but.

Yeah no I don't know.

People will hear about it.

Yeah in the clip that we're going to but you're feeling better.

No I'll probably try it again but yeah it didn't go so great last time.

Mm-hmm yeah it didn't go.

All right well we're going to hear exactly what happened to you.

This is from episode 59 with Paul F. Tomkins in Todd Glass and we're going to hear a little bit about Mr. August Lindt in his background.

Are you tripped on memory Lane Hahn?

Yes of correspondence is that Elaine Boozler on a stamp?

Yeah that's right yeah we put her on a stamp over there in Germany everybody wants yes she's a national hero over there.

Wait a minute wait a minute I just noticed what you were pointing to Paul.

Yeah the correspondence.

Yeah for mentioning correspondence.

I've got correspondence with me because I need to look.

And I have to say I'm sitting just across from you.

Yeah.

I read a little bit of it while you guys were talking and it's a suicide note.

What?

Don't go reading my mail.

That is a federal offense.

That's a real thing.

I'm going to kill myself at the end of the trip.

What are you telling me about?

I'm going to be going surprised.

Later this afternoon time myself to the Hollywood sign and set it on fire.

What are you doing this today?

Today!

Wait a minute wait a minute.

But why are you going to kill yourself?

Why not?

Now hold on hold on.

It's not to that answer coming.

Why do you mean why wouldn't I do it?

My goodness.

Let me ask questions about your plan.

Now how long is the rope?

You're tying yourself to the sign.

You're going to set the sign on fire.

The sign is going to burn down and then is the rope long enough for you to try to get away?

I'm not going to try to get away.

I want to catch on fire.

So you want to catch on fire and you want there to be no way for you to run away and get help.

You don't understand how to kill yourself.

It's part of it is not to get help.

But it seems to be time to hold out.

He's getting time to hold out.

700 foot rope.

Then he lights it on fire.

Then he runs 700 feet.

But it's still the rope on me.

Your plan is bad.

Scott I'm worried that you're asking him questions.

It seems like an endorsement of his plan to kill himself.

I just want to make sure he does it correctly because it seems to me like you know when you're actually on fire the will to live is so strong that it seems like you want to have nothing on you that could cut the rope or you want to have nothing on you that could cut the rope or you want to have nothing on you.

You might be like one of those monks from Vietnam.

You know set themselves on fire.

They never ran away.

They just sat there and took it.

Men.

Yeah.

I know I'm not a monk.

I am going to eat a pretty strong rope.

That's a good point.

Do you think Tony Shalub ever set himself on fire?

No, a purpose.

Well you're talking TV's monk?

Yes.

Exactly.

Sorry.

Yeah.

Well this is a sad story.

No it's not.

Please don't be like that about it.

It's going to be great.

You're going to read about it in the paper.

I'm going to be a big star.

It's going to be big.

Wait.

You think you're getting famous from this?

No.

You're not going to get famous from it.

Hollywood sign burns down.

By the way it was because the guy was there on fire.

It is true.

Too bad.

Let's meet him.

You know what I mean?

The article doesn't you imagine your name.

Yes.

Good for God.

I'm very realistic about how it's going to play out.

Everybody.

Oh.

In a related story.

This guy.

Pretzel Mica from Doosle Dof is dead.

Unnamed Pretzel Mica.

Missing.

Yeah.

All right.

Well what was your name again Nick?

Oh that's Lynn.

August.

Yes.

Lynn.

Do you want to stick around Nick and stick around for the rest of the show?

I would love to hear your input.

How long is the rest of the show?

Oh it's another five hours.

Okay.

Yeah.

That's fine.

Yeah.

That's no problem.

What would have been a problem.

That's a good question.

Yeah.

If five hours you didn't blink it.

But if it was only like another hour there'd be no point in staying.

Oh I'd be too short to stay.

I'd be too short to stay.

Sure.

There'd be no point.

So what's next for August Lynn?

Well just another attempt at it.

You know I'm going to take another run at it.

See what I can do.

Yeah.

What month can we look for that?

Let's see it's December.

I mean this is really the time.

You know December is great but I've got already RSVPed in the affirmative for so many parties.

I probably won't get to it till late January.

Okay.

Well look for that.

Look for the Hollywood time being burned down.

You will see it.

And a guy.

You'll see it on fire.

And I'll be up there.

Who knows what he's brought with him.

Who knows what he's going to bring to the Bible.

Oh he just popped up right behind Nick.

He was hiding behind Nick like a sneaky person.

You sneaked.

I'm a very sneaky person.

What made you so sneaky?

I think he was hiding away in the farms of Latin America ready to bounce out and suck the blood out of goats that caused me to be sneaky.

Well congratulations Chupacabra.

That's... you seem surprised.

I was very surprised to win in the war because no one has ever honored me before.

And I live in Hancock Park.

Can you let me see if I can call the baby.

Go go go go go go go go go go go.

That's my cell phone.

Is the baby calling you or are you calling the baby?

He was calling me.

Oh baby hello.

Elgato.

Ok man.

Oh so nice to hear from you baby.

He buried my stupid hearing from you his way.

Baby you never call when Chupacabra isn't around.

I would love to talk to you whenever he's.

He doesn't let me calling with him.

Are you in some sort of baby slavery?

Go go go what?

Go go what?

Yeah.

He has sold me like a person says people.

How does terrible Chupacabra why do you do that?

I don't know.

It's a cultural thing perhaps.

Well thank you so much baby Chupacabra always a pleasure.

Go go what?

Go go go go go go go go go.

You guys have very similar catch phrases I have to say.

I know.

You guys we're very close friends we influence one another.

Can I talk to Nick for one second?

Ok hold on.

Nick.

Hey how are you?

Hey man thank you so much for being a part of the show.

This is best performance of the comedy death ray radio theme song.

You all know how he was just here earlier in the program at the beginning of the program.

In fact Reggie Watts always comes by he comes by and he performs the theme song and then he hops on a plane usually 15 minutes away from the studio.

So we're just wondering which time did you vote for was the best one and let me see what the results here on that and.

Hey hey hey sorry interrupts.

Oh hey Reggie.

Hey what's up.

Hey I was thinking maybe.

Did you miss your flight or something what's going on.

Well I kind of did you know but it was like one of those like end of a teen movie you know realizations and I just like came back and I'm here and I just like I overheard you talking about this and I was just thinking like well why don't I just do you know a new version of the theme song.

Well why don't you do the best version of the year right now.

Yeah.

Ok yeah I mean that sounds good to me I mean you know I hate to think of all those disenfranchised voters but.

Yeah well you know I don't know I mean art trumps politics.

That is true.

Alright well here we go then Reggie thanks for coming back and why don't we hear the best version ever of the comedy death ray radio theme song right now.

You got it.

It's the best.

Yeah.

Wow Bravo thank you so much Reggie.

Alright man thank you so much.

Thank you.

It's time for our next award.

This is best James Adomian performance.

James Adomian is a bright shining young star who we discovered.

He wouldn't want us to credit for that.

No but he's been a great friend of the show and he's been on the show many times.

He does very many characters of which you'll hear about in his nominee his nominations rather.

And let me say who the nominations are.

The formation of the Enigma Force 5.

Hule Houser becomes another crow bot due to iced tea's prodding.

Meryl Schindler's restaurant reviews.

One of the most despised characters on the show.

Second only to little Gary.

Jesse Ventura wolves and sheep's clothing.

Yeah I don't even know what that refers to but look it up.

And Christopher Hitchens water board someone for love.

That I believe was our Valentine's Day episode and I don't remember any of those details.

Although I love the people who do.

Alright so let's figure out the winner here.

The winner with 40% of the vote a whopping 40% Hule Houser becomes another crow bot due to iced tea's prodding and here to accept the award are Hule Houser and iced tea.

Yo yo yo what's up everybody it's me the rapper and actor iced tea.

Hi everybody this is Hule Houser and I am down here accepting what is it?

Well this is a comedy death ray radio award for best James and omi and performance.

Best Joe, why would I be here then?

It doesn't make any sense.

That's a good question doesn't make any sense at all.

This is nonsensical.

So this is so we're just here it's like I've just crossed in the Alice in Wonderland world.

You're the looking glass.

I was just gonna say with through the looking glass now but everybody beat me to it.

You gotta be quicker on this show.

Wait now everyone knows the most famous books in the world.

If you I tried to go through a looking glass once and I just ended up with shards of glass all over my throat and face.

You'll sometimes I think you'll like a big bird like you see another you see a mirror and you're like there's another you'll have there then I'm gonna go get them.

Well yeah no I had to I had to put padding on all the mirrors in my house down in Palm Springs just so I wouldn't get cut up by the little demons that live inside of them.

Palm Springs is located in what state by the way.

Well Palm Springs is in California that's now a little bit and everything.

A lot of people don't know this is their first time listening to this show.

Hule you are a little thicket.

Can I have your questions?

Yes.

Could this be somebody's first time listening to the show?

Well because people see best of they hear about the show and they go oh that'll be the best episode to start off with.

Got good point.

I got it.

I didn't answer it.

Why would you well I got another question is there are other part times that this show has happened?

Yeah you've been on it several times Hule.

Oh boy.

That's that's so what I like about this.

That is just as happy as a bucket of piglets.

Wait a minute.

A bucket with piglet finit.

Well you had just a bunch of piglets rolling around bathing each other with soap.

We inside a little bucket.

Hule you grew up in a farm right.

I don't really remember that as an expression.

Oh no we would all we'd take the little piglets and we'd bathe them in a bucket and they'd sure be happy except for the bottom couple who would you know you'd have to turn them into feed cause they wouldn't.

They drank too much water and they'd go sleep for a while.

Well you know they'd start falling apart.

You mean they drowned?

I don't know but they would just start falling apart when you try to get them to go run out and play.

What do you mean they fall up like they'll.

Yeah their little pig feet would start falling off and their little faces would just start turning into frowns.

Yeah the decomposing that the dead.

You drowned those piglet fuel.

You're a monster Hule.

What the hell.

You're like the Jim Jones of pigs.

Well no that was the CIA.

Oh oh it seems like we've triggered something.

You know we have triggered that this is odd.

We've established over your appearances on this show that you don't remember anything about your childhood.

Oh that's right.

That the first day you ever remember is arriving there on a boat right.

Well now I was I'm I've there was the early days when I was with my mama and.

You do remember your mama now.

Well no but just I just remember her is just something that I had carry around a picture with.

And there I am and they've told me I wrote it down all over my arms.

Yeah you're making great progress because when we first met you you didn't know what a mother was.

You remembered a woman who took care of you.

Oh yeah no but you told me that.

Yeah.

Now but you are you did you.

Are you now is are you my mother now.

I am certainly not I'm not you've been taking care of my awful good since I wondered in the comedy.

Raise you the asking the same question about the cement mixer outside.

He's like that little duck in that book.

Oh wait a minute.

Yeah there's a little book with a little duck in it.

It's a regular sized book.

Well I wonder if the duck would like to jump in the bucket of pigs and give them all massages.

Oh no this sounds horrible.

Horrible.

Well no some of the ducks like to give massages to the pigs.

The pigs like it so much they start kissing on the ducks until the ducks are falling apart too.

I don't think that's kissing.

Can I ask you a question.

These are ducks and pig lips.

Do you look kind of like people?

Well not well well no they walk around with little sailor shirts on but they never have pants on.

You talk about the whole duck and you eat you eat you eat you eat you eat you eat you eat.

And a porky pig.

Well sure don't pork I remember that was but that little piglets.

I don't think that these are pigs at all actually I think these were your brothers and sisters.

Now hold on a second are you telling me that there's just a bunch of other huell houses running around?

Not huell houses but they look like ducks and piglets.

Oh god.

And then you put them all in a bucket you drown them in a bucket and that's why you don't have family anymore.

Why?

Why is it always Christmas?

Why is it always Christmas when the quacks of the ducks come back and remind you?

Did this happen on Christmas Eve?

Oh boy.

Oh gosh.

Maybe you should abandon this line of question.

Okay yeah yeah we don't want to get to play detective on TV and this looks like a head down a bad road.

That's right I see you do play the back of the box.

I'm gonna hurry the bucket of the pig slop with the ducks face.

Get away from me.

This is bad.

Alright let's switch to another topic.

You mean there's other topics out there?

Yeah the three other topic.

Let's talk about Lassalia California.

I will get to it.

I'm sure.

We'll get to it.

It's on my left.

So I see you are an actor more of a rapper Q-M actor.

Yeah.

I was a ractor.

You were a raptor.

Oh raptor.

A philothoraptor, clever girl.

Then I became an actor later in life.

Like I got two careers going.

Yeah you know in the September of your years you took on a new profession.

I'm not.

Come on.

I don't think it was the September of my year.

Alright well we're certainly in August.

Now I'll give you that.

Wait now hold on.

You said it's September?

No it's a metaphor for how old I see is.

If you think of like January it's like when you're a damn baby right?

Oh!

And then December is when you're dead.

So you've just lived a really short time then right here.

Well it's not literally old.

I mean how long have you lived?

I don't know a hundred months.

A hundred months.

That's just really short.

Yeah.

I thought that old.

What would that make you?

I'm not good at man.

I'm not a nine years old.

Well how long do most people live?

Most people live an average of 72 years.

72.3 years.

Well I probably half way up there up the five freeway heading towards the end of my life.

Oh if you think of a life man in terms of California like the state of California.

So you're almost.

You start out in San Diego.

Right.

And you're just working your way up to Eureka.

The one with the why.

Eureka.

And you're at about San Francisco now?

Oh no well gosh.

I say I'm I've spent a lot of time in the Bay area just hovering around here.

Would you.

I would say I'm more in my desk though at this point.

Okay.

You're in the Modesto.

You're in the low die.

I'm in the Modesto of my year.

Do you know the song low die by creating the Clearwater Revival?

Oh sure I do.

I've partied with those guys for a while back in.

When was that?

Well that must have been all the way back in two layer.

You used to party with C-the-R?

Oh yeah sure.

We've partied when we drove up to two layer county together.

I see does that does that get him mad respect from you?

Absolutely.

I feel like C-the-R the American Beatles.

Some people say the Beach Boys.

I think that overrated.

Oh really?

Tell us about that.

I think the songs are just corny.

Just like surfing.

Oh yeah gosh this sounds like the qualities of what it is to be a human being pig.

What?

You would be a pig.

Just surfing.

Just living on cars.

Living on cars.

Just living on cars.

I feel like what happened to you.

I'm talking about my days partying with Cretan's Clearwater Revival.

We had some good times.

We would go up together.

It was mostly when I was looking at pictures of helicopter, icing gooks, envy at mom.

Cretan's Clearwater would always be there just singing along with me and that was the party we had.

So you're saying while you were in Vietnam and you were open of fire on the enemy you were listening to Cretan's Clearwater Revival?

Well they would always just come on at the moment to the most action or the most action.

So you guys didn't have a radio there or anything?

Wait a minute.

Did you come on in your head?

Did you watch a movie?

Yeah.

Oh yeah there's that movie that they made, all those movies they made for me about me just to remind me what it was like.

Those movies weren't made for you.

Those movies like Platoon and everything were made as a cautionary tale to remind us of the horrors of war.

Oh no, God, so I thought it was true.

Alright here it comes.

This is from last year's Best of program which came out at the end of 2010.

This is the end of last year's Best of which is kind of strange to listen to a Best of on a Best of.

2009, yeah, yeah, sorry.

But it's kind of strange to listen to a Best of Clip at the end of...

It's really strange.

Yeah, it's...

I'm freaked out.

So this is the Best of from the way back before.

Yeah, this is the Best of 2010 so we're going to play part of the Best of 2009 on this show.

So it's just the Best of the Best there.

The Best of the Best.

There you go, it's the Best of the Best.

Oh!

That's a good way to put you.

Well I learned that from CCR!

Bringing it back.

Alright, so let's hear that this is the end of last year's Best of Show here on Comedy Deathray.

Oh boy.

You're telling me because this one is the best of the best.

Because this one is one of the same race and you're asking the same question.

I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go.

Do you like to see things happen to the number two?

No, this is not good.

I'm gonna go.

I'm gonna shout out to you what two is.

How many times does two have I been?

Two times!

Hey, uh...

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

He's lunging at Ice-Tee.

Yeah, come on, come on.

Oh, he turned into a robot.

He turned into a...

Oh!

He turned into a...

A crow-bot.

A crow!

What is a crow-bot?

He turned into a robot and he's like transforming into a bird-like robot.

It's huge!

I don't know what that...

I don't need to answer nobody's questions!

This guy...

AHHHHH!

That's the question!

Smucker-dicker!

Oh!

He turned...

I'm trying to keep this jab between us and he's like, he's lunging at me.

This guy's strength is unbelievable!

Ice-Tee!

I won't spill you now!

Come down!

He's got the strength of one and a half sandwiches!

You'll just calm down!

Now look at me!

Look at how...

He turned into something there!

He's almost there!

Now I'm going to go to every part of Southern California and clear out anybody who doesn't look like me!

Oh my god, he ran out of the studio.

He really punched the shit out of me.

Oh my god.

Are you all right, Ice-Tee?

Yeah, I don't feel great.

I'll be honest with you.

I mean, he robot punched me like about 40 times.

He crow-bot punched you.

Yeah, he did.

Comedy death ray, that is the winning clip.

Boy, what a huell.

Is that bringing up any strange memories for you?

I saw a snail crawling across a blighted grass.

I don't like the sound of this.

Yeah, he's shaking and sweating.

Yeah.

Are you an assassin?

Oh, no.

Not at all though.

I'm just a...

Friends.

You're a nazer.

You're Aaron Boyce.

Sent by a grocer.

Tickle like a bear!

Oh no.

This is impossible.

Listening to him turning into a crow-bot has turned him into a crow-bot.

In retrospect, we should have seen this before that happened.

Yeah, that's true.

Oh no, he's a pig.

Oh, a pig-bot!

A little pig-bot!

A black and a pig-bot!

Oh no, oh no no.

He will do us a favor, change back into huell.

Our friend, Huell Houser, change back.

Hey, you...

Look, I'm a ducklin'.

I'm gonna give you a massage.

Oh no!

There you go, right?

Just get deep in the shoulders.

I have to feel like a little pig!

There you go, buddy.

There you go.

Take it easy, right?

Oh, I'm down.

There you go.

Deep tissue.

Oh, that feels good.

A little rolfing.

Now I'm just gonna eat your little face out.

Oh no, no, no, no.

Ah!

Oh no!

I'm gonna get out of my face.

Oh my God!

I separate them.

So engineer Doug, separate them.

Oh!

Damn, he's crazy.

He's crazy.

My cheekbone.

Oh, are you all right, though?

I guess I'm okay.

I'm fine, yes.

But he wasn't asking about you.

How did you know?

Crazy fool.

All right, guys.

Well, that was a great clip.

Do you want to stick around and hang out for a little bit while we do another award?

Yeah, all right.

What about you, Huell?

Well, I guess I don't have any choice.

Well, sure you do.

This is America.

Anyone can do anything they want.

Oh, I don't believe that.

Okay.

All right.

Our next award.

Voted on by you, the listeners, is for best single appearance character.

This is someone who came on one time in the calendar year.

Scott.

Who's this now?

It's me, Daddy Glama.

Daddy!

Did I win the award?

You were only on one time this year.

That's right.

You came on when we were talking about Mel Gibson.

Yeah.

And you wanted to give your reaction to...

That miserable son of a bitch.

Unfortunately, you were not even nominated.

I can't...

This is outrage!

Good days!

All right.

Well, Scott, this is Christopher Hitchens.

Oh, Christopher Hitchens is here.

I've wheeled myself in in my counter chair wondering if I perhaps won the award for the...

You were also not nominated.

There was here for a single time and now I'm dying.

Yes.

Rapidly metastasizing hatred throughout my body.

You were not nominated.

Let me tell you who the nominees were.

We have Gerald Tibbins.

Gerald Tibbins, David Keckner's character.

Ben Alterman, Andrew Daly's character.

Gary Marshall.

Paul Tompkins did Gary Marshall one time.

Did he?

He did.

Marissa Wampler, that is, of course, the great Jessica St.

Clair.

And Bill Cosby Bieckowski.

Bill Cosby Bieckowski.

Those are the nominees and I am proud to announce that with a whopping 68% of the vote, this was a landslide.

The winner is Bill Cosby Bieckowski.

Hello.

Hello, everybody.

Here you accept the award is Bill Cosby Bieckowski.

68% of the vote so you can suck my dick, alright?

Suck my dick, you and also you and also you, Scott.

Thank you.

That is...

Okay.

Let's explain Bill Cosby Bieckowski a little bit.

Bill Cosby Bieckowski, I am Bill Cosby Bieckowski and I am a Jell-O-Wit.

Good ex-learning.

I am a Jell-O-Wits and I am a Jell-O-Wits and I don't take shit from my children and I will rain down shit on your face if you fuck with me.

That's a great explanation.

But let's just try to kind of explain you a little bit.

What do you thought?

I think I cleaned everything up.

I'm about 5'10".

There you go.

No one's really interested in those.

I think everyone had a picture now of what this guy is like.

You are neither Bill Cosby nor...

No, my...

No, my Charles Bieckowski.

It's Bieckowski by the way, not Bieckowski.

Okay.

Bill Cosby Bieckowski.

Yes, Bieckowski.

What is it exactly you do?

You're a Jell-O-Wits.

You say Jell-O-Wits.

Do you have any kind of examples of those?

I pimp out my children.

I pimp out my wife.

And I sell white socks outside of my home on the table.

I sell them for $3 a pair, so you can come out and get some white socks.

Are you talking about athletic socks?

Athletic socks.

Yes.

Some of them are striped and some of them are plain.

And also I'm a college professor.

Yeah, I teach about that part of your career.

I teach Jell-O-Wits at Brooklyn College.

And that's been a fun little thing.

They gave me a non-dirary degree.

I got under-arriaged degrees from Brooklyn College, from Harvard and from Temple.

Are you a tenured professor?

I wouldn't say I'm a tenured, but I put a robe on and said the COS...

The Bill Cosby Bieckowski show was great.

The robe said that?

Then I had a speech and the award was presented by my friend, Frasier Fonzie.

And so the academy continues its downwards, I don't know.

Frasier Fonzie is a good friend of mine, and so I wanted him to share a few thoughts.

Alright, so we're going to hear a little bit in the clip.

We're going to hear Jell-O-Wim.

This is a Jell-O-Wim that I wrote.

And does it need any kind of setup at all?

Just let me set it up.

It's a Jell-O-Wim.

That's what I'm asking.

That I wrote.

Scott, will you just let the guy set this up?

Okay, my apologies.

I believe I wrote this.

You're welcome.

I died for 20 minutes 1989.

And I woke up and I was like, I have Jell-O-Wim and I need to write them.

So this is a Jell-O-Wim I wrote.

Alright, this is from episode 73.

This is Bill Cosby Bieckowski on Comedy Deathray.

Boo-Yakasha.

I got another one.

It's called Who's the Moths?

Who's the most fuckable Hux-table?

Who is the most fuckable Hux-table?

Angel Debate.

This is more of a free form.

Claire!

Sandra.

Rudy.

Theo.

Vanessa.

Cockroach.

Lisa Boney.

That's so raving.

Get down here and circle up.

I should have said, oh, Dad, what's going on, Dad?

You've got homework to do.

Shut your mouth.

Circle up your chocolate cake eating degenerates.

And here's the contest.

This is who's the most fuckable Hux-table?

The one who gets to eat a Jell-O supper and sleep in their bed tonight, the loser's out on the fucking street.

All kids say, but Dad, I don't want to go.

I said, Dad, I don't want to go.

I said, shut the fuck up.

I'm painting the rent.

I make the rules.

And I stop crying and give you something to cry about.

Vanessa, you can leave.

Vanessa says, but Dad, it's a zippy lip.

You came in last before you even show up.

You're the least fuckable Hux-table.

Now get out of here before I stab you, bitch.

Now cockroach, you say you sit around.

Now pull out your dick.

Cockroach, now make out with my son.

Make out with Theo.

Cockroach.

Cockroach says, well, I have to, Mr. Hux-table.

I say, what?

What?

Are you questioning me?

Listen up.

I got a PhD from Hofstra and raining down shit on your face.

Now come, tongue gets my son.

The boys to do so.

Okay, you lose sleeping the street.

Rudy, your example because you're too young.

Get out on the street.

Now Lisa Bowney.

We've seen some morals.

Yeah.

Lisa Bowney, shake your shit around.

Oh yeah.

This is the one I'm begging on by the way.

No.

Take this laugh, chicken and do some angel-hard shit.

Oh yeah, okay.

She says, bak bak bak.

So she snaps his neck and drags his blood.

Opie-cabered.

Now pretend I'm letting it crack its.

Okay.

Contest over.

You got the jello dinner.

That's so raven.

You're the runner-up.

Your prize is you get to play Leonard Part 7.

Okay.

That's the second jello-um and I hope that you enjoyed it.

That one ended pretty abruptly.

Yeah, well, that's clear to Smith.

So what happened to Claire?

Claire died in the middle of the jello-um.

Oh my God.

You never mentioned it though.

It's just heavily inferred.

G-O-D on heroin on the couch.

Jesus.

You got stung by the brown hornet.

Just whistling-coy.

Whistling-coy.

What if we did that?

That is the whistling-coy.

What if we did that?

We just heard the...

We just heard the Bill Cosby Bukowski.

Your winning clip.

Congratulations.

You're welcome, everybody.

I thank nobody.

I thank only myself for my beautiful jello-a-tree.

And everything's fine.

Do you have any poem you want to bust out here?

I can bring one but I'll make one up right now.

Yeah, stop your head.

Slam jello-a-tree.

Is it a poem or a jello-um?

This is a jello-um.

Please don't insult me by calling my jello-a-tree poetry.

Oh.

You're okay.

Off the top of your head.

Okay.

This is my jello-um.

It's called...

I'm fascinating.

All right. I'm fascinating by Bill Cosby Bukowski.

I think I'm fascinating.

When I walk down the street, people look at me and point at me and say, Oh, look at that jello.

Look at that happy chap.

It looks like a happy chap.

A happy fellow walking down the street.

What's eating jello?

Can I have a spoon?

We just got a rhyme in there.

Fellow and jello.

Are you going to comment on this?

Is that going to be what you do?

Yeah.

Is that part of the poem?

That's part of the poem.

Jello-um?

No, you're interrupting.

That's part of the jello-um.

Maybe you're doing commentary for people who are not cited.

Yeah, exactly.

Hey, listen.

Follow what's going on.

This is poetry for the blind.

It's poetry?

This is jello-a-tree for the blind.

Check your under oath, sir.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

I continue.

We got our first rhyme.

Okay, I'll continue.

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Let's listen to Feist.

I like that one song she did on Sesame Street.

It's got a great beat.

I also like rap.

I don't think it's crap.

Now this is kind of a little simplistic.

Well, by the way, I'm a fascinating man.

I think I'm fascinating.

But wait till you see me urinating on your street.

My pee smells like potato soup and also jello because that's what I eat.

A potato soup and jello.

Those are the things that I eat.

I think I'm fascinating.

Wagla on the street.

I'm assuming that's the end.

That's the end.

Did you hear the coda?

It was a Shakespearean, you know, how they end things.

Usually the person of highest status steps in at the end of a Shakespeare play to wrap everything up.

The king will come in and say, oh, what a tragedy this has been.

Sorry, everybody.

I thought you had to fit through a play.

That's usually, yeah.

All Shakespeare's greatest play then with an apology.

They ought to watch a play.

Sorry, TV hasn't been invented yet.

Sorry about that.

Just hang in there, folks.

For another couple hundred years.

Things are going to get good.

Well, thank you so much, Bill Cosby.

Do you want to stick around?

Oh, sure.

Stick around.

Scott!

I'm sorry I'm late.

Did I win?

Who is this?

Come on, it's me, Gary Marshall.

I'm Gary Marshall, but I won.

You're after a Valentine's Day.

That's right.

I'm coming to New Year's Eve.

That's all.

I hope everybody will go see it.

It's going to be a nice movie.

Everybody gets together.

New Year's Eve, celebrating, and people fall in love.

I am sorry to say you did not win.

You came in runner up.

Wow.

Well, look, it's your show.

You do what you want.

I think you're making a huge mistake.

But, um, okay.

If that's the way the people voted, then there's stupid people who don't understand that I am great.

Gary, you created Happy Days.

That's right.

Do you know Bill Cosby, Bukowski's friend, Fraser Fonzi?

Of course I do.

Oh, wait, I got him right here.

Hold on.

I love Fraser.

Hey, Fraser Fonzi.

Come here.

Hello?

How are you?

Fraser Fonzi, it's good to see you again.

Hey, everything's cool.

It's been quite a while.

Have you been?

Everything's been very cool.

How have you been, Gary?

I'm good.

Listen, are you still dividing your time between Wisconsin and Milwaukee?

I am.

Oh, no, I've just now got it.

That's funny.

I've been Seattle and Seattle, of course.

Seattle?

Wisconsin's in Milwaukee.

I go from Seattle to Milwaukee to Boston.

I used to frequent a Boston.

Oh, really?

So you a quarter of your time in Boston and a quarter of Seattle?

A third, yes.

A third of my time in Boston, visiting my children that I had with my wife, Lilith.

And then I...

Wait, Laverne, Lilith?

Laverne.

Yes.

She's not here, is she?

She's an icy bitch who wears 50 sweaters.

And I currently reside in Seattle.

And I have a radio show there.

That, you know, is very successful.

Do you have to get the radio show?

Do you have to hit a jukebox?

Yes, I come in and I slam a jukebox.

And then I have collars and they come in and I talk about their problems with them.

Do you ever advise anyone to sit on it?

Usually I'll say stay cool.

Or sit on it.

Or step into my office.

Sit on it.

Then that'll be my advice.

Pretend you have a problem.

Hey, I'm upset because I'm sad.

Okay.

Step into my office.

All right.

Be cool.

Sit on it.

Thank you.

If you check for $120.

$120 a session.

That's it.

That's a session.

How is Ralph Mouthe Perry-Gillpin doing?

Ralph Mouthe Perry-Gillpin is dead.

Oh, this is how we find out.

Ditavades in 1989.

Oh, it was a while ago.

That was a while ago.

I'm surprised you were asking about it.

The TV show Frasier was even on the air.

What Perry-Gillpin was...

She was in the actress.

She was alive.

Yeah, she did some good work.

Look, I'm not trying to say she didn't exist in 1989.

Niles Woody is doing very good.

Niles Woody.

Is he a cross between a Frasier character and a Toy Story character?

No, there's a character on Cheers called Woody.

I don't know if you remember him.

The rules of this are getting very confusing for me.

Hey, the rules of the game keep changing.

You've got to keep up with it.

It's take-cool.

Well, thank you so much Frasier Fonzie.

We have to get on it.

Oh, that is...

You should sit on it.

Never.

He gotcha.

The classic...

I have to step in your office after you tell me to sit on it.

Hey, listen, sit on it.

He gotcha again.

Damn it.

I got to stop engaging.

All right, it's time to get to our next award.

Our next award is for Best Female Character.

Best Female Character.

This is a lot like the Best Actress Award on the Oscars.

I'm honored to accept this, Scott.

Thank you.

Who is this now?

It's me Ariana Huffington.

You have never been on the job before.

I have one time I was.

Yeah, you said one sentence last week.

Now I'm up to two.

Okay, pretty good.

Not bad.

Not bad, I'll give you that.

Sure, myself, I'll give you these two.

All right, let me say who the nominees are for this.

We have, it looks to be six nominees for this award.

We have Kathy McDowell, Irina Stinchen, Claire Woodruff, Marissa Wompler.

Julie Penzmir.

And the winner of this award with 46.4% of the vote is Dick Nataro and the Good One Robot.

Good one.

She's here with us accepting the award is the Good One Robot.

Good one.

Let me ask you, Good One Robot.

Do you say anything else other than Good One Robot or a Good One rather?

Do you say Good One Robot?

No.

Okay.

Just no and Good One?

No.

Just Good One.

Okay, so you say no, just and Good One.

No.

Just.

Good One.

Okay, so I'll take that as a yes.

No.

Because those are the only words you can say.

No.

Just.

Good One.

Okay, so you say no, just and Good One.

No.

Who created you, Good One Robot?

I actually, I think you did Scott.

Oh my God.

Oh my goodness.

She's learning our language.

No.

Good truth.

Scott, it's me, Paul.

I came back because I want to talk to TIG.

Paul of Tompkins from the beginning of the show.

That's right.

Hey, how's it going?

I'm John Daley.

John Daley's here.

Welcome.

Did you have a question for TIG?

TIG, I did have a question for TIG.

Okay, can we drop the guys of the Good One Robot now and now we're back to TIG?

Good one.

Now it's back to Good One.

How can you tell me about the creation of the Good One Robot?

This is a fascinating story.

What does it take for you to get into character?

Basically, I showed up to Comedy Death Ray Radio.

Oh.

Oh, Scott seems to have fallen asleep.

Oh, hang on, let's let him nap.

Okay.

And then we'll go back to the show.

I heard it's dangerous if you wake up a person who's sleeping while someone else is talking about a character.

It's dangerous to wake up a person that's sleeping.

Just period.

Yeah.

Across the board.

Guys, please keep it down.

No.

What?

Meryl Schindler.

Guys, please.

What a guy now.

Tastes a terrible...

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

How did you create the character of the Good One Robot?

No, I heard you the first time.

I was right, so it's not to wake.

Oh, no.

Okay, eight.

Oh, no.

Come on, get away from the limb sleep.

So, I came in here to do Comedy Death Ray Radio, which we're on right now.

Can you make this sound more intimate?

Absolutely.

Yeah.

So anyways.

Tell us about that.

So anyway, I said something.

Alright, I come in here.

Whisper tastes horrible.

And I'm talking to Scott.

You've met Scott the host.

Scott, I'm going to get spurs.

He said something so not funny.

I said something.

Oh my God.

Oh, I had the worst, most horrible nightmare.

I was eating pussy and it was disgusting.

So hang on, Scott.

And then one of my friends said something really rude about me.

No, no, no.

So then I says to him.

I says, good one.

Alright.

I says to him, I says, good one.

I didn't know I was a good one robot.

And so then I leave, come back and do another episode of Comedy Death Ray Radio.

Right.

A lot of details.

Yeah.

Scott says, do you know if good one.

Good one robot.

You're really biggling the story, by the way.

Hear me out.

Oh.

Scott says, do you know if good one robot will be joining us?

What time of day was this?

It was probably noon between noon and one, I guess.

I bet you're right.

He says to me, he says, will good one robot be visiting us again?

What did you says to him?

Okay, I said to him.

I says, I don't know who that is.

And he said, he says.

He says, I says.

So he says to me, he says, last time you were on the show, I said, I said, I said, I said, last time you were on the show, you says to me, he says, good one.

So here I am.

Interesting.

Yeah.

Well, there's no need to play this clip anymore because we've heard the entire story.

That's true.

And the entire character.

And so well told.

Good one.

Any plans for the good one robot in the future?

I have a lot of plans for the good one robot in the past.

Really?

Yeah.

How'd that work out?

Are they going to go back to the old Wild West and meet ZZ Top?

Yeah.

What else would they do?

That's pretty much the only option.

What do you say to all the women in this category who have been doing character work for their entire careers?

Bad ones.

Can I say what my favorite tag character is?

Is the woman who's been married for 40 years?

Yeah.

That's a great one.

Hey, Ching.

Yeah.

Well, that may be nominated next year.

We'll look for that next year.

Alright.

I hope so.

But even if you're around the corner, it doesn't matter where you're on the house.

That's great.

Take, thank you so much for dropping by to accept this award.

Thanks for having me.

I love you, Scott.

And whenever I'm here, I'm happy.

You are a female and you want this award.

You listen.

Good one.

You deserve a whistling choir.

You know what?

I'm really happy to get it.

Whistling choir.

You're the same time.

I'm glad to be here.

I was glad to be here.

What if we did that?

Whistling choir.

What if we did that?

Whistling choir.

What if we did that?

Well, never do it.

Yeah.

Alright, it is time for another award.

This is for Best Would You Rather.

Best Would You Rather is a game that we play on the show occasionally.

And how this works is I ask for Would You Rather scenarios on my Twitter at Scott Ockermann only when I ask for them please.

And then I ask our guests these scenarios and they can ask me any question about the scenario that they like.

And then we try to figure out which the best scenario is they vote and then we determine a winner.

And that seems pretty easy to figure out, right?

I think so.

Hey, I see you welcome back.

Thanks Abby.

You're welcome.

You're welcome too.

And with 49.1% of the vote, the winner is Would You Rather Own a Magical Penny or Have a Nose that was able to lift off like a jet pack after every sneeze.

Who within that one?

That was from episode 76, 76.1 and two.

And that was Zach Alifenakis and Andrew Lloyd Webber played that with me.

Oh, that's pretty good.

Dame Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber was not been on the best of yet.

But yeah, that is the winner.

Well, that's too bad.

Out of the way.

Oh, hello Scott Rick.

Ah, Dame Sir, I'm so sorry.

I'm tired to the party.

If I wanted a water, you certainly did.

You won best would you rather.

The devil you say.

I, the devil I do not say.

Have the fans voted to be this honor?

Yes, that is the only.

I'm not finished.

Okay.

Well, yes, this is not finished.

Yeah, to say.

May I say to all those, yeah, let's does comedy death radio.

I thank you.

I thank you and you are welcome.

Well, you're welcome to you as well.

You are welcome, Scott Rick.

Well, you're welcome for that.

You're welcome.

All right.

Well, why don't we hear that clip?

Oh, geez.

This was right.

This is probably our most popular episode we've ever released, actually, in the wake of Zach Alifenakis' murmurings.

Oh, I meant to ask you.

Yes.

I didn't want to do it at the time.

Who is that again?

Zach Alifenakis.

Who is he?

Everyone seems so excited about it.

I don't know.

Yeah.

He burst onto the scene six months ago.

Yes.

Why?

I don't know.

But people love him.

Has no one seen a beard before?

They're fairly common, please.

They were back in your day.

Well, yes.

The day of the Phantom of the Opera.

That's right.

The Phantom.

Ah.

Damesir, L.W., let's hear that clip.

This is best, would you rather?

This was you and Zach Alifenakis playing, and let's hear it.

Yes.

Time to play a little game that we call, would you rather?

My heaven.

We're playing them all.

Three games.

Trying to get our money's worth.

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la I am a fan of ender cats.

On a train.

Say bye on skates.

Say bye.

Jeremy P.

P.

Jeremy P.

P.

Jeremy P.

Jeremy Jeremy.

You know what I would love?

Okay, that's how you play with your alley.

No, no.

No, we didn't play.

No, we played the game.

We played the game.

Next segment.

All right.

So here we go.

This comes to us from our attack, our attack, I believe.

Would you rather own a magical penny or have a nose that was able to lift off like a jetpack after every sneeze?

All right.

I'm opening the floor for questions.

I have a question.

All right, dancer, a L.W.

When I sneeze and this nose lifts off like a jetpack, it should be as a jetpack does.

Does my nose detach itself from my face and fly up into the stratosphere?

You basically, your nose detaches from your face and you then straddle your nose, much like in Dr. Strange Love, how that cowboy straddled the bomb and you sort of wave your cowboy hat around.

A la slim pickens.

Slim pickens.

That is exactly who I was thinking of, of whom I was thinking.

It seems that it would be, and let me ask you if it is, is it rather difficult to straddle my own nose?

No, actually your nose is perfectly contoured towards your knees.

So the little indentations on the side, it's almost like writing a motorcycle and just, yeah.

But now when I sneeze, does my nose go into position and then I'm able to straddle it and take off?

Then you go, achoo, and then you hear, and your nose slides forward and then you hear lift off imminent in five, four, three, nose, one, and then you know by that.

This is every time I sneeze.

Is it possible to sneeze in the scenario twice in a row?

Like something you can do.

Oh, you don't want to do that.

You don't want to do that.

But I have no control.

Please don't ask any questions about that.

Please don't.

This is unprecedented.

Please, you don't want to do that.

I'm presidented in the world of wood you rather.

Oh, no, damn sorry, Al W, please don't ask me any questions.

I shot sneezing twice in a row because that is far too dangerous.

Just know you sneeze once, once is all that is safe to do.

Your nose detaches from your face.

You hear that countdown that we all know so well.

Lift off imminent in five, four, three, nose.

One, and then you straddled it by then hopefully and you take off into the wild blue yawn.

Follow up question.

Yes.

Al W, I recognize you for the follow up.

Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen of the wood you rather battle.

May I ask, am I in control of when and how often I sneeze?

Well you can.

The quantity of sneezes, I guess I'm asking.

You can pluck out your nostril hairs to try to sneeze.

So if you ever see a cat stuck in a tree, you sit there plucking out your nostril hairs and eventually it works and your nose detaches from your face, then you hear that countdown that we all know.

What is it again?

Yeah, it's down, down imminent.

Lift off imminent in five, four, three, nose.

One, and then you grab onto the nose and you pluck that cat out into the nose.

You straddle it and you grab that cat out of the tree on your way up.

And then once you get down, you hand the cat over to its owners, presuming you know who they are or you keep it, whatever is your choice that day.

One more follow up and then a sidebar.

Yes, sure.

We have time for one more follow up and one more sidebar.

Do I, my follow up, do I enjoy riding my own nose?

Is it pleasurable?

Is it fun?

Is it exciting?

It hurts at first to detach from your face but then it is the most fun thing you will ever do in your life.

Alright, my side bot.

Zachary, it doesn't seem to be asking you many words for this.

Well, it's hard to get in here.

I must say you're an expert at playing the game.

So Zach, do you have a question though?

I will recognize it.

We haven't heard a lot about the other scenario by the way, the magic pen.

Not a word.

My question is.

Yes.

So if one has allergies and sneezes a lot, it could be a terrible thing.

Depending on how often you like to go riding around in the sky.

Well, there's often times the sneezes are inconvenient.

And if a sneeze isn't convenient, I would imagine a trip to space as you've done with Richard Branson.

Indeed.

So you've already done that.

Yes.

So you should consider that your answer as well.

May I ask this?

Oh, wow.

Okay.

We never got to a question from Zach.

Zach, he's just interesting.

And just more of a rumination from him.

He has a great question.

Is he going to keep asking questions?

When the nose is detached and I'm riding it.

Is it still able to sneeze?

Please, please.

Dame's are a L.W.

I beg of you.

I want to ask you not asking any questions about further sneezing.

It's really grotesque.

We don't want to frighten young children who have been listening.

How shall I ever sleep again?

Not for the ladies to listen to.

It's not polite conversation.

I would imagine ladies aren't listening to this to begin with.

Would you be able to, with the magic penny, make requests?

Thank you for using the Richard reflection.

Sorry.

It's wearing off a little bit.

I appreciate it.

Here's how the magic penny works.

Okay.

You get one wish as long as it's a wish for making your nose detach and riding around with you sneeze.

That's my question.

Yeah.

So any other wish will not be recognized by the magic penny.

No other wish would be recognized.

No.

That is the only wish that we...

Okay.

I have my answer if that's the case.

Okay.

Great.

Any last questions?

One final question.

Here we go.

For wishing incorrectly, is there any penalty or punishment from the magical penny?

Yes.

The magical penny as a punishment will make your nose detach from your face anytime you sneeze.

So when you and then make you ride around on it.

I think I know what I'm going to do.

Okay.

So let's vote here.

Zach, how do you like to vote?

I'm going to have to go with the nose scenario.

And why is that?

Because of what you said last.

That the only wish that I would be granted from the magical penny would be that my nose become detached.

But you never have to wish that if you don't want to.

I thought you said that was the only...

That's the only...

Sure.

That's the only wish that you can get.

I'll say you get it.

I don't have to wish it.

No.

You can just put that penny...

Alright.

Spend that penny if you retract.

No, I'm sorry.

But you already voted.

No.

No, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

You missed lead.

What a border.

Santa Monica town meetings they have on KCRW.

The bell town meetings.

Alright.

Dame Suray, L.W., how do you like to vote?

Bear in mind that Zach, perhaps incorrectly, voted for the nose.

Well, knowing myself as I do, if I had that magical penny, I'd probably inadvertently blurt out something like, I wish my nose would detach from my face every time I sneeze that I could ride it like a jetpack into the stratosphere.

After a countdown.

After a countdown that we're all familiar with.

Yes.

Last off, even in five, four, three, nose, one.

Yes.

So I'm going to choose that scenario.

Okay.

So you vote for the penny and that, of course, is the correct answer.

Because then I've got the penny.

Yes.

And that is the correct answer which Zach did not hit upon.

Unfortunately, he voted incorrectly.

Zach, I already...

So, Dame Suray, L.W.

I voted for the penny.

No, you voted for the no rice.

Unfortunately, which means you've lost the round, which means Dave Sarah Alw is our big winner.

A perfect game for... Does that mean the contested must leave?

Must find me, Gris. No, but that is a perfect example of how you play, would you rather?

Perfect.

Jeremy Piven. Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy. Jeremy.

Jeremy Piven. Jeremy.

Great one. I wish the great one, Robot Word Vented, so...

Great one!

Nice job. That was a great, great show.

Listening to that clip again was like listening with an old friend who sounds exactly like me, and has the same thoughts and responses.

Well, it is... Thank you very much for being here, Dame Sarah.

You're welcome. You're coming up for you?

Just more great music, more legendary musicals of the theatrical variety.

Seems like you haven't put out a legendary one in maybe 20 years.

You put out a... No, I'm not trying to.

Oh, really? You just... Don't have!

You're trying to put out just media-wise.

What I feel like putting out a legendary one, you'll know it.

They can't all be...

Truck. What is that truck? Truck. Truck.

What did we do on this... Shh.

Oh, dramatic.

I'm thinking we'll make him use all of that trucks.

Oh, really? What would I be about?

Wait, is it anthropomorphic trucks?

Indeed. That's why Starlight didn't succeed.

On trains. Trains. They're too limited to the rails, you see.

Trucks can go all over the place.

They can cross rails. They can... They can...

They can cross rails, yes!

They can get stuck on rails, and then the roller skating trains could slam into them.

I'd say, if these roller skate trains make an appearance, do they get to do self-refraid drool?

No, not at least. My dear boy.

I think people would be delighted to see those old-year-old trades again.

I think it would be a lot like going to see the Phantom of the Opera, and then all of a sudden, Evita just comes in and you'd be like, Scaldric, you're making me think!

Ever gigantic crossover, team up event?

Smash all my musical-old characters!

Together, wouldn't you like to see Jesus Christ, Superstar, Meet Joseph, have amazing protector, collard dream code fame, old and new testament blending together?

Both testaments!

You're thinking it's all like, I don't know, happy birthday!

Maybe it's someone's birthday.

I don't know if you can get the right side of your birthday.

Those old ladies, they keep a...

Mulejoo and Patty Hildos, too.

Bitch-a-loo.

Stingy bitches, that's what they are.

Well, like, you know, because a lot of your musicals have had birthday scenes in them.

Yes.

Almost old!

The family opera was given a special birthday cake by all the members of the opera.

Scaldric, may I make a conventional piece?

Yes, please do.

And this is the place you can do that.

I just want to write songs anymore.

It's very difficult, you have to write things.

And then you have to pick the first part of writing songs.

I just want to buy songs that already exist and write a flimsy plot around them.

Like, people do those jukebox musicals.

Maybe you could do something with, like, say a song like it's hot in her.

Suetigo, for you clues?

Yes, of course.

Bye, Gileir!

Maybe Yavita takes off all her clothes.

Ooh, what does she do?

That would be a great mashup musical as all of your character singing songs of From Today.

Yes!

Modern hits.

Sufaddom, Yvita, a cat!

One of the jellicle cats.

Not your own grizzabella.

What about a glamopuss?

What about a glamopuss, yeah.

Could a glamopuss ever drop on it?

I feel something's a secret, dear boy.

I couldn't possibly have a glamopuss singing contemporary.

Is that the only thing that's sacred?

In your uvro?

Yeah, that's personal.

I just, that one glamopuss.

That's a passage for religion for me these days.

I worship at the altar of the glamopuss.

Alright, well thank you so much for dropping by, dear boy.

You're welcome.

And thank you.

Ah, you're welcome.

Am I welcome?

You are quite welcome.

You are also welcome.

You are more than welcome.

We're both welcome.

Welcoming!

Oh!

I'm afraid, though, it's time to move on to another award.

Oh, what a ghastly nightmare.

This is the award for Best Song.

And now we have had several songs on the show over the past year and people have come by and been gracious enough to provide us with musical performances, exclusive musical performances.

And we are here to determine the best song and you may be wondering, why am I over-describing this?

Yes!

And that's rarely because I'm looking for nominees.

Why?

Oh!

Behind the scenes!

The nominees were...

Oh, wait, wait, wait.

Who is this?

Who's this now?

Announce yourself!

Hey, Scott, and sir...

Dame sir.

Please.

Thomas Lennon from Reno 9-1-1.

From Reno 9-1-1 in the stage and Viva Variety.

Thanks for throwing out the middle, the middle slice of the ball.

You guys are getting that together.

Sometimes gets left in the icebox.

We knew it was about your reunion on this very program.

Yes, we did.

Who is San Francisco's schedule festival?

Sketchable festival.

You were there last year.

That was your first appearance on this program.

Indeed, I won.

Oh, we had a dear old time.

Bonus episode two.

One was Garfunkel and Oats.

Yes, well, I have them right in front of me.

Let's do this one.

Okay.

I'm not sure why you're chiming in on this when I have them right in front of me.

We have...

Attesting my brain.

Exciting.

That'll make sure that you don't get Alzheimer's in the future.

Also, don't drink out of those cams.

Yeah.

All right, we have...

Oh, the other you mean...

Don't use any deodorant is the other one.

None.

I don't.

All that true.

Well, that's what that is.

Okay.

It's me.

I was wondering what that was.

No, it's me.

I thought there was...

Tom's of Maine.

Yeah, I thought there was a pot dispenser next door.

No, that's just natural.

It's the pits.

It's natural pits.

Have you ever thought to do a musical about armpits?

Only every day.

All right, the nominees for Best Song are Weirder Scott with Halo.

I realized I should have nominated...

Hello, that's a far better entry.

That got almost no votes.

Let's see.

The Monster Fuck song from our Halloween episode.

We have Lil' Gary's I'm Not Food.

Steel Panthers, I want it that way.

And Garfunkel and Oates, they covered a Weird Al song to his face.

They covered one more minute.

A lot of times you don't get to cover a song to someone's face.

Watch.

At someone.

How dare they...

I'm gonna cover your song at you.

Simply isn't up.

But they did it, so...

The winner is Weirder Scott with Halo.

No, that's of course not true.

Of course Tom Loveholz.

That's almost terrible.

It's actually my second cousin, Lil' Gary, I believe, right?

Lil' Gary is the winner.

Lil' Gary, I'm Not Food with 40% of the vote is the winner.

Wow, that's really not that much percent of the vote.

I thought it was slightly higher.

No, I mean, considering everyone else.

Well, no, no, everyone else is in the tens.

Oh, so there you go.

Oh, so take that Garfunkel.

Yeah, that's four times as many votes as anyone else can.

Yeah, a lot, yeah.

So, but I do have, I have breaking...

Lil' Gary, let's explain Lil' Gary because this is a lot of people's first.

Lil' Gary is my second cousin.

Yes.

Lil' Gary is about 23 inches tall.

Yeah, he's in between a midget and mini-me.

Exactly.

He is a great guy.

He has a couple of health problems.

Yeah.

A couple is...

A couple of...

He's a guy who's been, you know, like a...

He's a small guy, so like, he gets trampled more than a lot of people.

Yeah.

He gets more than most...

Yeah, more than most people.

So, block one of his arteries, all he really has to do is bend over.

Right.

He sometimes has to breathe out of his eyeballs because he's so messed up.

He's been on fire probably more than almost anybody.

I would say take all the people you know that have been on fire for a while.

Combine them.

Divide it by zero.

Yeah, you don't have to divide it.

He's been on fire more than...

Divide it by one, I should say.

The little dude catches on fire a lot.

Yeah.

And...

You want to play the song first?

Yeah, we should play the song.

Basically, he came by the show in a recent episode and he had been having some troubles recently with...

People think he's food.

People...

He's...

Because he is pretty small.

Now see, if this all makes more sense to me than the Zac Elephant Eckers.

Still, I don't get it.

Yeah.

It is the beard, by the way.

It's just...

He's got a beard.

But I'm really amazing, a really thick, full bushy beard.

I take nothing from that beard.

No, it works hard to be wearing.

Dude!

It's prodigious.

It is distended and bushy.

So...

I got a telegram and it seems...

From Western Union?

Yeah.

I got a Western Union telegram from...

You're having a time machine?

You can still get them.

It came this guy and...

Here's the thing.

This guy?

Which guy?

You know that little Gary had been doing rodeos for the poor.

Yeah, heavily established.

He's doing rodeos for the poor.

Not to benefit the poor.

Then he found out later that all rodeos are for poor people.

Rich people don't go to rodeos.

Yeah.

Then he had also been working as a freelance pinion in Ciudad Juarez.

Did that...

Did we know that?

No, this was news to me and everybody on my mom's side of the family has been pretty upset by this.

How does one work as a freelance pinion?

Here's the thing.

Not many...

You and I couldn't probably do it.

We're not 23 inches tall and we don't look like a burned old little...

...log.

So he was working as a freelance...

They were so poor in Ciudad Juarez.

You know the drug cartels have taken over 100%.

Oh, of course.

Yeah, we know that.

They rule the city.

So what he...

What little Gary was doing...

You're really breaking up on it.

Boy, you are getting so emotional.

Well, I can tell you...

Yeah, I will take one.

Thanks.

Would you like another?

I would.

They have anything.

Boy, he's a really, really thin...

You might want to invite him to some two-ply tissue.

I'll take the...

Take my hand, could you?

So, he...

Little Gary had been working as a freelance...

Here's the thing.

People down there, because the drug cartels can't afford a pinata, they're not going to use more than one time.

You understand me?

So what little Gary was doing is he would, for a fee, a nominal fee...

You could hang him in your backyard for a party and you could fill up his, I guess, his shirt and slacks with candy.

And then children, of course, would get out broomsticks and they would whack...

Until the candy.

Because they don't play baseball down there.

So there are no baseball bats to whack a pinata with.

You know, that might be what happened and apparently...

They do clean their houses.

He had a long weekend and I guess he did a couple quinceÃ±eros in a row.

And this is difficult for me to get through.

He had done a couple quinceÃ±eros, so like, you know, he's making two or three, probably US dollars per quinceÃ±eros, where...

It's interesting. One would think that quinceÃ±ero would be a time that a young girl would want to grow out of pinata.

No, these grow... no, no, they're strong and they've got the bloodlust.

And they see... this is a living pinata and I think they get this Latin bloodlust.

And they look in his eyes and they see fear.

Yeah, they're very fiery.

I've seen that on modern family.

There's a little bit of blood in the water.

So they see, they realize, oh, this pinata's somewhat alive.

And they go... they went to town.

They went to town.

Where does the candy come out of?

His shirts and pants.

Oh, okay.

And I guess it's socks.

But, you know, but basically what's happening then is, is you gotta understand.

He's not pad, he's not a stunt man.

He's not a professional actor.

He's just a little fellow.

Stuff to the candy.

He's a little fellow who's closer, stuff with candy.

So, he did not survive his last quinceÃ±ero.

You don't believe what you said, top his letter.

He fought for a long time.

He's a fighter.

You know he's a fighter.

No!

But little Gary, I am so sad to say.

No, not very.

Little Gary has gone onto his reward.

And I just like to think for me and for my mom's entire side of the family.

You don't get to do this!

I like to think for my mom's entire- You don't get to come on and do this!

My mom's whole side of the family.

Not at the end of the year!

I just hope- Not in a time of celebration!

You don't get to do this!

I just hope that he's in a better place.

And I'll be honest, if you consider that the place he was in was tied to a tree in a backyard in Ciudad Juarez, being whacked with poles for a quinceÃ±era, any place he's in is better really.

Oh, little Geralt.

Half of the fans will be so upset.

I would want to, in honor of him winning this award, I wanted to play I'm not food for you.

The way he would want to- Oh, this is- To be remembered.

Makes it all better actually.

I thought I would tribute- I don't feel bad at all anymore.

A very small, unfortunately dead, badly, badly burned, frequently, partially trampled friend.

Yes.

Little Gary in the song is called- I'm not food.

Comedy death, right?

I see you're looking at me.

You look pretty hungry.

I need to let you know.

That I'm not candy.

Or a piece of beef jerky.

I know I'm kind of little.

Barely up to your knee.

But I'm not a skiddle.

Or a leg up small turkey.

I'm not that little.

I can tell that you're in the mood.

And I look like I would taste pretty good.

But I am not food.

I'm not a french fry.

I am not food.

I am a guy.

I am not food.

I am not a french fry.

I am not food.

I am a guy.

I'm not food.

That's what I got.

I'm not food.

Hey, quit letting me, your dog lick me here.

I am also.

I'm also not a dog toy either.

Oh God.

Oh God, get your dog off of me.

I swear to God, put me down.

I am not food.

That's what I got.

I'm not food.

That's what I got.

I am not food.

I'm not taffy either.

Tell your friend to put me down.

I won't fit in your mouth.

Please don't even try.

I'm not fun to chew.

I swear to God, I swear to God.

I am a guy.

Oh my God, I can't breathe.

I can't breathe, put me down.

I have to go to the bathroom.

I swear to God, I have to go to the bathroom.

I am not food.

I am a guy.

I'm not a great downtown Franklin.

No one's going to have to.

That's a little Gary.

Wherever he is.

Wherever he is, buddy.

Thomas Lennon.

It's a skull trigger bay.

I am Reno 911.

I'm not food unplugged.

Yes.

Dame, sir.

Do you want to buy that song?

I must ask for the Richard of Baha'ed Kuchif, as I have been so moved.

Tobinik, the song you have just sung, is a fitting you, Gee, for little Geralt, and I do hope.

He's a good one.

He's a reward.

I'm going out to.

He's a great beyond.

When you cry, I hear the resemblance.

I'm going.

He's on my mother's side.

I hope that he is resting comfortably in hell.

In fairness, it would probably not phase him.

If you've been partially or even fully trampled.

And on fire that much.

On fire that much.

He probably is.

Probably.

He's probably.

That's the reason.

I hope they might put him in charge of like a bulge, or what do you call those in hell?

Bulge.

I hope that he gains a few inches in the afterlife.

Could you imagine a toddler?

Would you get ruled?

Then again maybe I hope that he doesn't because I can't imagine.

I can just go out and give him a bath.

Reach does not exceed his grasp.

How is he better than the carbon ape?

Ah yes, that is so true.

I do.

You're welcome.

Well Tom, thank you so much for coming by and accepting this award in his...

To celebrate his legacy.

It's been a hard time for everybody.

He will no longer be on the show.

I know that that disappoints a percentage of the audience.

He will no longer be on comedy death rate.

He did his best.

He was supposed to be here every week.

He was supposed to be our announcer every single week and he did his best.

He got trampled a lot.

He got burned a lot.

He only made one or two or three appearances.

And he also got pinned and stuck under things that would never happen to you.

Well good on him.

What an uncharmed life he led.

Tom, thank you so much for dropping by.

We'll see you later Tom Vakes.

Pleasure.

Well, it is time now for our final award of the show.

That is right.

Best episode.

Best episode of the year.

Scott, I hope you don't mind my stick around.

Please do.

I would love to give this award out in tandem with you.

Oh, it would be my great honor, sir.

I would love to be either arm in arm or hand in hand, something like that, while we give out this award.

Is that possible at all?

Let us link legs at the knee.

Right.

Can we do my left and you're right?

Absolutely.

Alright, that is my choice.

It's logical.

Alright, I'll just say what the winner is.

There's far too many of these.

Alright, the winner of Best Episode of the year is our Anniversary Episode 51 with 17.6% of the votes.

This was the episode we did in May, I believe.

It marked our one year anniversary on the air.

Everyone dropped by.

We had James Domian, Tig Nataro, Jerry Miner, Nick Kroll, Rich Folcher, Seth Morris, Tom Lennon.

Also a man by the name of Paul of Tomkins Drop Eye, or at least he called in.

Will.

It's a great episode.

If you want to find a great inn on the show and a great place to start listening to the show, that is one you can go back on.

Go to earwolf.com, and of course, and you can search through any episode, search through our performers, search through our performance.

Search through our shows, we have a blog, everything on there, and you'll be able to find episode 51 really easily.

Or get that on iTunes, wherever you like.

And wow, what a great episode, huh? Did you listen to it?

I listen to every single second of it, as I do every single week, more or less.

Do you listen three times like Iced Tito's?

I listen four times.

What the?

I listen when it comes out.

I listen while I'm driving to my studio, where I write my musicals.

I listen while I'm doing laundry, as everyone does.

And I also listen to the shower, the bath.

I take hour-long showers, sometimes an hour and a half of the episode goes longer.

The hour of showering.

The showering, the bathing itself takes place in the space of five minutes.

You're clean, yeah. Most people are clean.

Then I just stand there.

They're enjoying the heat.

They need water.

Go cold.

Yeah, it's a lot like being standing in the rain naked.

Yes.

And I can't really hear it over the rushing of the waters.

I'm sorry if I'm missing some of the finer points of your episode.

It's the fourth time you've listened.

You did it.

I'm sure you're letting it wash over you much like the shower itself.

It's almost as if now I'm feeling it, as opposed to listening.

Like it's emotions rather than actual information.

Yes, go trick. You've done it.

It surprises me that you do your own laundry.

Did Sarah Brightman do that for you?

No, no, no.

I supervise the laundry being done.

Okay, yes, my servants.

Track?

Was that a track that needed to get out?

Someone out of the way?

Well, episode 51, what are your reminiscs for us?

What were your favorite parts?

Are you addressing the episode?

Yes.

Hello.

I am the episode number 51.

I'm addressing Jeremy Piven.

Jeremy Piven!

Where, no, Dame Sir, please.

So, what were some of your favorite moments on?

Well, I enjoyed calling in from the MetLife blimp in the company of Ice and Tea at Johnald Sierraile.

I enjoyed warning people about the impending threat of Sir Richard Branson's weaponized balloons.

Forget about that.

And then I enjoyed hanging up and ending the phone call.

Yes, because then you get on with the rest of your goddamn life.

You did.

You hit all of everything.

Well, speaking of getting on- Why are you all favorite parts, Scortrick?

No one ever asks the who's doing this?

No one ever asks me any questions.

What do you like about comedy out of three radio?

You know what I like?

I like, just, you know, I like expressing myself through art.

There we go.

Yep.

Well done.

Thank you.

Well, speaking of getting on with our goddamn lives, that is all we have for the program.

Listen to episode 51 at your leisure.

And thank you so much.

This has been a fantastic year and I really love doing the show.

Oh, wait a minute.

We have someone on the hotline here.

Hi.

Who is this?

Dad's going to have a bad night.

What's the- Hey Dad, hey.

What under God's green earth by the cloven hooves of Pan?

Who is this?

Right, I would never do not just travel for an opportunity to meet Steve.

Dad, why would I?

I'm trapped under a child's pool.

You're trapped under a child's pool?

You're trapped under a child's pool.

I'm trapped under a child's pool.

You're trapped under a child's pool.

Oh my gosh, that was exciting.

Paul, what do you think about that?

Did you understand any of it?

I understood child's pool and he'll be back.

That's what I got too!

Yes.

Oh, I'm back by the way.

Oh, well, thank you so much.

You're welcome.

Hello, Scott.

Well, that is our show for the Best of Show.

That is it.

We did it.

We ran through some clips.

I want to thank a lot of people here.

Since it is the last show, I want to take the time to thank some people.

I want to thank everyone who helped out on the show this year, first of all, the guests.

Of which you're welcome, you are one of.

Thank you and you're welcome.

We couldn't do the show without the guests, of course.

You should try it though.

No one would want to hear that show.

I do.

People would rather hear the guest show without me.

I get a lot of messages of that, but...

Yeah.

You should try that too.

Yeah, why not?

It's a fucking experiment next year.

Everyone, we love everyone who's been on the show.

It's a great pleasure to be sitting here in the same room with all of them.

We want to thank the engineers from Stu to Joe to Joe the sequel to Good Old Engineer Doug here.

Thank you so much.

You make the show sound good and we couldn't do it without you as well.

Young Jeff Ulrich, he came to me with a dream this year and we started Ear Wolf and it's been a smashing success.

We're a lot like modern day Icarus'es except our waxy wings aren't melting off anytime soon.

So check out.

Sound like Stan Lee.

So check out our other shows.

Excelsior.

Scorbro country who charted how did this get made, clear in the garbage, and more coming next year.

Ear Wolf team, thank you to you.

Cherus, our graphic designers, Aaron and Joel and Carolina Anderson.

Thank you so much for everything you've done.

And of course, I want to thank the fans you've made this year one of the best of my life and the response has been incredible.

Doing the show has been constantly rewarding, both personally and professionally for me.

So I want to thank you all for listening and making it the success that it is.

Watch out for the show to get even better next year.

And one last time, we want to say, what's up hot dog?

And we will see you in MMX High.

Thanks.

Bye bye.
