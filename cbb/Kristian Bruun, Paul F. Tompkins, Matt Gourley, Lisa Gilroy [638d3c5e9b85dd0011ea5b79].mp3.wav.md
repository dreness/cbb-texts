♪♪♪ By the power vested in me by the great state of Minnesota, I pronounce you married, you may now eat ass.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Oh, dear.

Thank you to Gherkin Thirstrap for that catchphrase submission.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

Happy decky doggy to everyone out there.

We are now in the throes of December.

None can dispute that.

Who would argue with such a statement?

No one.

No one amongst us.

We have a great show.

Come here a little later.

We have a mythical creature.

We also have a budding artist.

That's exciting.

But let's get to first someone who is sort of is a mythical creature and a budding artist in his own way.

He has been on the show many times before.

I believe I met him when he was dressed as a turtle.

I don't mean turtle from Entourage.

Please welcome back to the show Christian Bruin.

Thank you so much for making that distinction between a real turtle and a turtle from...

Turtle from Entourage?

He would be...

A real ninja turtle.

He would be wearing a baseball cap, a t-shirt, a pretty clean white t-shirt.

Okay, I'm glad I'm not wearing that currently.

Yeah, and then sweats.

I'm trying to think of below the waistband on turtle.

I'm not a sweats...

Shimmy!

Hey!

Hey, Shimmy!

I've never met you before.

Well, it's nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

Yeah, I'm Shimmy.

Hey, Shimmy!

You were out a couple of weeks ago.

Was I?

Yeah, you were.

Well, now I'm back.

Yeah, you are.

I think you wore basketball shorts a lot.

You wore basketball shorts really.

Like the long ones, the Adam Sandler ones.

Yeah.

Oh, classy.

What was his tequila that he made?

Oh, that's right.

He had...

He wanted everyone to get involved in buying tequila, right?

Or did he actually ever get it made?

I think he got it made.

Was he the most successful of all the chums?

No.

The entourage chums.

I think many chas was.

Well, that's true.

He is Queen's Boulevard.

Yeah.

What a movie.

Well, gotta go buy...

Oh, buy Shimmy!

Wow!

Entourage fan.

I don't know how he sees it.

I'm trapped here in the year old studio.

Oh, hey!

Oh, Shimmy!

Oh, man.

I've got a new single coming out.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

Oh, you play for Talmour?

That's right, I do.

Did you play on this one?

Yeah, I played one of the instruments.

Okay, I go buy.

Oh, how did they get him?

He's been trapped here in the studio.

I'm trapped here in the studio.

Just to tell you that Shimmy has joined the band.

Hey, man!

Hey, how's it going, shims?

Good to see you.

Yeah.

Shimmy, wasn't Shimmy in the band last time?

Not your own official, but we certified it.

We noted as it.

We went down to the Norak County Registrar and made it official.

Incredible!

Congratulations, Shimmy!

It's a great deal.

Oh, you know what I mean.

Come on.

Okay, sure.

We're having a good time.

We are having a good time.

We're friends.

Yeah, we're great friends.

We've got to go buy.

Oh, right.

We're such good friends because he leaves immediately.

Yeah, that's probably the one.

Before things can get contentious.

I should go too.

Bye.

Oh, okay.

Didn't even get to say hi to Matt.

Hi, bye.

Oh, got him.

Right back in for that.

Oh, get out of the corner and go under the halls again.

Well, Christian, welcome back to the show.

So, thank you.

Good to see you.

Basketball shorts, I'm getting the answer.

At all times.

Yeah.

What I like to wear.

Fresh kicks.

Yes.

Fresh kicks.

I actually do have fresh kicks.

I hate wearing sneakers with jeans and I'm now moving into that era of my life because...

Yeah.

You're in your 40s or 50s now?

Yes, I am in my...

Okay.

I am in my 40s, but not near my 50s.

You're not even near.

Not even near.

Really?

How far away are we?

We're talking like north of five years.

Okay, so about five years?

Five and a half?

It's seven.

No, I've got some fresh new balance kicks on it because...

Hey, look at that big Z on those.

Oh, no, it's an N.

Oh, is that an N?

Yeah, I was holding it up.

Okay, well...

Yeah, I wasn't facing the line.

That was for Zebra because they have stripes on him.

I call it a zebra and I say Zed.

That's right.

Yeah.

Is that Drew Canadian?

I'm a Canadian.

Yep, famously.

You're on the Manjianello Manhattan mystery.

What Canadian show are you on?

Murdock mystery.

That's right.

And it was not about Matt Murdock.

Daredevil with your friends at the house.

It was about Rupert Murdock.

Oh, okay.

Really?

Any kills someone?

Every episode?

Ancestor in the 1800s.

Yeah.

Ah, interesting.

It's not what it's about.

But you...

I don't know.

I say Zed.

You say Zed.

That's right.

Yeah.

And I'm looking down at the paper for something to talk about.

You have a new show, The Recruit.

You do, yeah.

Yeah, it's on Netflix.

It's coming out.

Isn't this the rookie?

No, but it's by the creator of the rookie.

Is it really?

It really is.

So what does this person do?

Who is this?

Alexie Holly.

He's our show runner and writer and creator.

What does this motherfucker do?

He's out there and he's like, what's another name for rookie?

Like, come on, bro.

It has to start with an R.

Yeah.

Those are his parameters.

He's got three shows and they all are the same thing.

Yes.

The rookie, the rookie, have behind a screen.

This is not a spinoff.

How about the relatively new her?

Hey, he's doing it.

Hey, it starts with an R, too.

That would actually work.

I'm going to take that to Alexie and see what he says.

So what does this recruit about?

Let me guess.

It's about an older guy who joins the cop.

He starts being a cop.

He's always older.

I met Gorley.

He joins the cop.

Got a run.

I don't think you're allowed to come in here just to make fun of.

Try catch me.

Shimmy, you're way.

I'm like, you came in because you started talking like he does.

I know, Talon, and I see it.

Go go back and hear it.

So what is it about?

It's about, it stars Noah Centineo and he is.

Okay, now this was the guy who was going to play He-Man.

That's right.

And then they were like, nah, forget.

No man.

Yeah, no man.

I play no man.

He's in Black Adam.

He plays Adam Smasher.

Does your Adam Smasher?

Adam Smasher.

The perfect guy to fight Black Adam.

No, he doesn't.

The guy who smashes Adam.

Oh yeah, but it's not Adam.

It's Adam.

You're evenly matched.

It's Adam Smasher.

Well, wonderful.

He seems like a great piece of talent.

He's a great piece of talent.

He's a tall, dark, handsome young man.

He plays a fresh law school graduate coming into the CIA in the office of the general counsel.

And he's basically...

He plays dumb shit boss.

I do not play as dumb shit boss.

I play another lawyer at the CIA who's been there a little too long.

He's very frazzled, very stressed out.

Slovenly boss who like wonders in every once in a while.

No, no, no.

He's very slovenly.

His filing cabinet is just full of like random loose things.

Yes, absolutely.

My office looks like garbage.

I look like garbage.

They give me like, sweaty, they make me sweaty every take.

Arm pit sweat.

Face sweat.

They blotch my face and make it red and blotchy.

I'm kind of always on too much caffeine and speed and...

You're always going to the bathroom because of all the caffeine you need.

They don't show that part.

They don't show that part, unfortunately.

They should.

More shows should show when characters go to the bathroom.

I agree.

And I think it would be very interesting to see what comes out of my character.

I remember that on 24 that was always the criticism against it.

It's like, when does Jack Bauer go to the bathroom?

And it's like they did show him sleeping.

And I think the first season he took a nap because everyone's like, when does he nap?

When does he nap?

And then they were like, oh, we don't have to do this.

Yeah.

I mean, he took a nap during commercials.

He like, you see him nod off and then it goes beep beep beep beep.

And then like, it comes back beep beep beep.

And he will like jolt himself awake.

I think our show should have that in there.

I think that'd be nice.

There is a scene where I am napping and I get jolted awake.

Really?

We'll give you that.

Which episode?

First episode.

Why are you jolted awake?

I'm not at liberty to say.

You can't talk about it.

Look, no one cares about this show.

It's the CIA man.

Can't talk about any of it?

I mean, I can talk about what it's about.

Noah sent to Nail, fresh out of law school, joins the CIA.

Come on, I'm not giving something.

He gets pulled down the rabbit hole of a gray male case.

It's like black male in the CIA.

Someone, you know, they get a stack of papers of people trying to like gray male the CIA.

He finds one and pulls him down a rabbit hole.

That's what it's about.

Literally?

There's no hole in a rabbit that he gets pulled through.

I'm sorry.

And where did you film this, Canada?

We filmed it in Montreal, but it takes place in Washington, DC and around the world.

Why, obviously.

Tell me why, Scott.

Did you do one day of exterior in Washington or did they send out a second unit crew just to like film the washi, you know, the- We did a few days in Los Angeles.

What's the stadium there?

What Expo stadium or Olympic stadium in Montreal?

Whenever they're doing establishing shots of Washington, they never do the stadium.

That's the first thing.

It's always the White House.

Yeah.

Show us the Smithsonian or something.

Like, murder at 1600 if it had started with the stadium there.

I'm going to be more exciting.

Or the baseball field.

Yeah.

So excitement, danger, thrill.

A lot of laughs.

Dark.

Dark laughs.

Yeah.

It's like very dark comedic stuff.

What are you talking about that you said is out of all of this that could be funny?

You're going to have to find out.

It's in there.

It's got thrills, chills, spills.

So, community genius Noah's Centatino, what's his name?

Centinale.

Centinale is Noah's Centinale.

He's wonderful.

Colton Duns in it.

Vonnie Curtis Hall.

Five of them.

I know.

Stuart.

Daniel Anno.

There's so many Angel Parker, Artie Mann.

It's a big cast.

It's a music ensemble.

There is music in this.

The Doug Lyman directed the first couple of episodes.

He's our- We drew a go.

That's right.

Of go.

Great movie.

I watched that recently.

From 1999.

Well, he's directed a lot more since then.

Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

He did swingers, of course.

Live, die, repeat.

Yeah.

And so there's music playing underneath the scenes usually.

There is some scoring.

Edge of tomorrow.

Well, they renamed it.

That's not a correction.

Was that the original name?

Live, die, repeat.

Back earlier.

Yes, it is.

It's the name that they gave it.

Oh.

Oh boy.

That's like someone changes their name and you're here to say what their original name is.

We don't do that, Matt, on this show.

We don't do that.

Yes, we do.

Scott Blaeserman.

Hey.

Damn.

You are wearing a blazer.

So music playing under the scenes?

There is some underscoring.

Is it like all happy?

Like born- He also did the first born film.

So it's like- I know what he's done.

He did have some Moby in born.

That's right.

Interesting.

So he directed the pilot and then he was like, peace.

He did the first two episodes.

We didn't even do a pilot.

We went straight to order, maybe eight episodes.

It's a tight eight episodes.

This is a thing when people go like, oh, we went straight to order.

It's like, anyway, can order eight of something.

Great.

You know what I mean?

Well, they ordered the recorder 22 of something and then we'll be like, whoa, a whole order?

But it's like, anyone can go like, oh, wow.

It's like, oh, wow.

We made seven more than a pilot.

Listen, this thing was expensive.

This was expensive, Scott.

Who wrote it?

Alexi Holly.

Oh, right.

This guy.

Yeah.

And how'd you get cast in it?

I auditioned for it.

Did you?

What was your audition like?

Did you just sing from the actual thing?

Actually, auditioned for another character and then I didn't get that.

And then, oh, we played her again.

Yeah, for Noah.

But Noah was attached from the beginning, so I don't know what they were thinking with me.

Just trying to squeeze him out in case he asked for too much money.

Yeah.

We want someone much older and much less handsome.

Yeah.

And do you remember, did you put yourself on tape or do you?

Put myself on tape in a friend's basement.

In a basement?

Why?

Because I just, you know, I was in the room and I was like, oh, I'm going to get a little bit of a dance.

I'm going to do a dance.

It's not an entrapment question.

I don't feel entrapped.

No, I am fine.

Santa Claus.

Ho-ho is ill.

What does Ho-ho have?

Sickness.

Oh, no.

That's bad.

That's the worst thing to get this.

Yes, terrible.

Listen, I came here to talk about Christmas.

Oh, good.

Well, it's coming up.

Oh, yes, it is.

My busy time of year when I deliver the toys to all the Christian boys and girls.

I mean, it really is.

It's one day a year.

So you can't say like December is your busy season necessarily.

It's just one day.

Well, I have to make the toys, don't I?

Well, yeah, but you're only doing it in December?

That's very rushed with all the help.

I really need to be just doing that a little more often.

Listen, I listen.

Yeah.

I'm glad you're bringing this up because it's time to talk about some changes being made to Christmas.

Oh, changes.

Yes.

I believe the MLB is not going to have umpires next year.

Like, does Christmas change in your year?

No, that's the same.

We will still not have umpires for Christmas.

That would be terrible if you went downstairs trying to get your presents.

There was an umpire there going, you're out of here.

In the umpires, we don't have.

We'll still be wearing their signature chest pads.

And will they have the, what is it, the FTV?

What was it, those patches that they were?

I don't know, and I don't care.

During the World Series, they were those patches for that sort of crypto thing.

Yes, I know.

I don't want to talk about umpires because they have nothing to do with Christmas.

Oh, but I was talking about them.

Yes.

And I don't want to do that.

Oh, okay.

Well, please.

I'm your guest.

Okay, let's talk about what you want to talk about.

Yes.

So this year for Christmas, there's a new policy in place.

And that if you want to get the Christmas gift that you asked for from Santa Claus, who is me, it's a mere eight dollars.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

And then you absolutely get the present that you want.

Oh.

If you don't pay a dollar, you get something.

Oh, well, I mean, I mean eight dollars, it's kind of like paying the tax, I guess, if you win a car on the price.

Exactly.

Well, it depends on the size of the gift.

I mean, if it's a really big gift, if it's a car, like a real car.

Children don't get cars for Christmas.

Yeah, but what about adults who still believe in Santa Claus?

Yeah, you see the key are not allowed.

Why do they make those huge bows if Santa doesn't give cars?

That's for rich people, my boy.

What kids have eight dollars to pay for this, though?

This service.

Well, we'll find out, won't we?

I don't know.

This is a good business model.

How are they supposed to get the eight dollars?

It's not a business model.

Santa gives gifts, but if you want to get the thing you want, it will cost you eight dollars.

Okay.

How do they get the eight dollars to you?

They send it to Santa Claus, North Pole, care of, made to Bob Driver, Los Angeles, California, 90125.

Sorry, sorry.

I couldn't quite hear what you just sent a clause.

Oh, Santa Claus.

North Pole.

Got it.

Major Bob Driver.

Speak up a little bit on this stuff.

Major Bob Driver.

It's in the recording.

Is it not?

Major Bob Driver.

Is that what I said?

I mean, it's, you were very quiet, so it was hard to hear, but...

Major Bob Driver, that's a weird thing that you would say that name because that's...

Smelly part of the address, my boy.

That's my manager.

Is it?

Yeah, Major Bob Driver.

Well, your career is thriving, my boy, so he must be very good at his job.

Interesting.

Yeah, we spoke to him in New York City.

New York City.

It's reflective, isn't it?

It's strange that the biggest city in the world can have a...

You just mentioned it, and then that pops into everyone's head.

Is that company still even in business?

I don't know.

What was it, Chile?

But I believe it was because I couldn't even tell what it was for.

And yet I remember that.

It was a bunch of cowboys who outraged at the idea that...

That there's also a week from me.

It's also something from me.

Mackerel here, get a rope.

That's asking us to get a rope.

Anyway, kids, send in your eight dollars to Santa Claus, and you will get the gift that you want.

Santa, where did you get this idea from?

Where?

There's a dollar idea from?

It just came to me.

I made an innovator.

Sounds very familiar to something that's happened recently.

Nope.

I...

Oh, it doesn't.

Oh, come to me.

Oh, not to Santa Claus.

Oh, I am.

Okay.

Santa, you're beard.

That's my boy.

You're beard.

Seems to be a different color than I normally...

Every time you've gone...

Have you been dying your beard?

What is it?

What color do you remember it to be?

Well, it was always this Christmassy snowy white.

Why?

Yes.

This is...

It looks like it has yellow stain, like cigarette stain.

Yeah, like around the mustache area.

And I've taken up smoking.

I just...

I'm in the last year.

I am immortal.

Why not?

What was I doing?

It's not smoking.

It's good for hair.

Yeah.

Alright.

Sometimes I drink poison for fun.

Oh, is it fun?

It is fun.

You see the little skull and crossbones on the bottle?

Yeah.

And you know that's not going to be me.

That's like liquid death.

Water brand.

Too scary.

Well, yeah, it's just your whole appearance.

I mean, you're still quite corpulent.

Jolly.

Yeah, that's code.

I see that on an audition breakdown.

Jolly.

Yeah, jolly.

Or skipped Jim Day.

I've literally seen that on a breakdown.

Oh, Jim Day.

Yeah.

I can watch that one day.

That's what the like day.

One day would have paid off.

But your clothes, I mean, what?

Are they not red?

They are red, but it's not the traditional sentence.

No, I mean, it's just a red T-shirt.

But red?

It is red.

Yeah.

And my beard is mostly white.

Yeah.

Santa Claus.

He and I, we are the same.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

We are the same.

Are you talking about a different Santa Claus?

Or are you just claiming to be the same person here?

The name Santa Claus is the same as me because I am Santa Claus.

Are you not the same as your name, my boy?

I mean, yeah.

Christian, can I talk to you?

Yeah, let's just, oh, hold on a second, Santa.

Sorry, Santa.

I know you're going to be able to hear what we're saying because you hear when we are sleeping.

You talk to each other.

Oh, no, I will.

Yes, he's a no-away.

I hear you when you're sleeping.

You're sleeping.

I smell when you're awake.

I'm Santa Claus.

Wait, wait, wait.

He doesn't even know the catchphrase.

He said we are.

Remember children.

Eight dollars gets you your verified present.

We are the same as reminding you.

No one can take it away from you.

When I was in New York, unless someone else asked for the exact same thing and handwriting his summary of, he was, I feel like then he was trying to say how we go.

We are the same a lot as well.

Really?

Yeah.

Okay, if you're both sitting there.

I'm going to throw something out there.

Do you think maybe we should go back to New York City?

No, I mean, I would love to.

I'd love to go to Broadway.

Yeah, absolutely.

That would be so fun.

No, I'm thinking that major major is pretending to be Santa Claus.

It's a parody.

And then I get to pretend to be Santa Claus.

Who would get to the next thing on your list?

Major Bob Barker, whatever his name is.

Oh, man.

Are you done talking?

I think we're done talking.

Yeah.

Are we done?

I just think we should probe this.

Oh, okay.

Christian thinks we should probe this.

Probe you.

What?

We should probe you.

Alien style?

I mean, if that's the way to do it, yeah.

That's really you.

Do you believe in Alien Santa Claus?

I believe that you believe in them.

What about the- What about the- You're very diplomatic in your answers.

What about the ectomorph?

Do you believe in that?

Aliens.

The ectomorph for the little grey guy.

Yes, man.

The ectomorph for the little grey guy is- Xenomorph.

Oh, okay.

Ectomorph for the ectomorph.

You're thinking of ectomorph for the ghostbusters.

Ectomorph for the ghostbusters.

Ectomorph for the little grey guy is- Xenomorph.

Xenomorph.

Oh, okay.

Ectomorph for the- Ectomorph for the little grey guy is- Xenomorph.

Oh, okay.

Ectomorph for the- Ectomorph for the little grey guy is- Xenomorph.

Oh, okay.

Ectomorph for the- Ectomorph for the little grey guy is- Yes, man.

Xenomorph.

Oh, okay.

Ectomorph for the- Ectomorph for the little grey guy is- Of course, yes.

They are the same.

Yes, flimer on your head.

That's right.

Look, I'm just going to cut to the chase.

Okay.

The chases are fun.

And that's when you're watching a movie- You got to cut them.

You sometimes wish- Cut to the- Cut to the- Cut to the chase.

Right, got it.

Yeah, I knew a filmmaker who once- Kill your darling.

Cut to the chase.

And he took out all the- Save the cat.

Oh, jeez.

Look, I'm just going to yank on your beard.

Okay.

Eww!

Okay.

That's- Yank- Yank- It's so hard, it's not on my face anymore.

Yeah.

More than a yank.

Look, this is a fake beard.

Okay, I see the tag here.

It says, machine washable.

Which- I don't know why you're not taking it's advice.

Yeah.

It's filthy.

Look, it's my first day.

Your first day- Your first day is Santa Claus.

Ah, look.

You have a bare face right now.

I see who you are.

You're my- Bear, is the day I was born my boy.

It's as bare as a baby's butt.

Which I had when I was born.

Yes, that's right.

But- Speaking of butts, You're obviously my manager, major Bob Driver.

Hello, my boy.

What a pleasure it is to see you.

Hi, major Bob.

Greetings of the season to you.

Yes, salutations.

Many hamburgers to you.

Have you got to hate Penny?

I haven't.

I'm boy.

If you haven't got to hate Penny, then God bless you.

God bless you.

What are you doing here pretending to be Santa Claus, major Bob?

Okay.

Well, my boy, you know, there are many ups and downs in the show business game.

And sometimes it's wise to invest your money and diversify.

And so I have taken over the Santa Claus operation from Santa Claus.

You've taken it over.

Yes, and it's proving to be a very challenging business.

And so I am trying to figure it out as I go along and make the best of it.

And so I'm trying to figure out how to do it.

You legally had to take over the Santa Claus operation.

I legally had to because I was affecting the business with my mouth.

Okay. Oh boy.

Yeah, so it's not going well then.

It's, I'm innovating.

It's going better than ever.

It's challenging, but fun.

Is it fun?

It's fun.

Wow.

I can really feel that.

So hard, right?

Having fun.

And I think there are like lightning bolts coming out of your eyes.

People will be happy with the new Santa Claus operation.

And so I think the thing is that you pay $8 to get your verified present.

Also, you cannot make fun of me.

If you are writing a song about Santa Claus, you can say that I am fat.

You can say that I am old.

You can't say that I wear glasses.

Because wear glasses.

Just nearsightedness is you can't.

By the way, if you are.

They watch it.

If you are a mortal, why do you have bad eyes?

Yeah.

And here's another question.

When you became Santa Claus, I mean, do you get his magic?

No, my boy.

I see this as what's going on.

You're still a mortal.

Yes, I could die.

You can't.

No.

Oh, I'm feeling a heart attack coming on if you don't think my idea is good.

Oh, no.

Please not that.

Oh, please.

My boy.

Who takes the mantle if you die?

I can't really discuss that.

I'm having a heart attack at the moment.

Oh, my boy.

My boy.

Please.

Sorry.

I just made your Bob.

Santa, the whole Christmas operation has always been free.

I don't know if you're going to be too successful at convincing people to pay $8 for something that they used to get for free.

But now it's very confusingly because it has grown.

It's a new modern age and everyone wants to know.

Yeah, that's a lot of ants.

The more ants you say, the more desperate you see.

Those are bonus ants, my boy.

Those are free.

We don't have to pay for those.

No.

Wow.

Okay.

I was watching Black Panther last night and I was thinking, what if you had to pay by the minute for a movie?

You know, so a movie that like Black Panther, this was two hours and 45 minutes long, it was like you paid, you know, like a, not a dollar a minute, but $0.10 a minute.

You'd want every movie to be short.

Wouldn't you?

Do you have to pay minute by minute?

No, you don't have to pay minute by minute, but it's like beforehand they tally up the minutes that the movie is and you have to pay 10 cents a minute or whatever it is.

And then if you don't like the movie, are you refunded the money that you pay?

That's, I mean, that's all movies now.

If you don't like the movie, if you walk out in the first 15 minutes, I believe they'll give you the money.

First 15 minutes, yes, my boy.

Oh.

But if you stay longer than that, the theatre keeps the money.

No, but you brought up something good about a refund.

Thank you, my boy.

Yes, yes.

Great idea.

So could I subscribe to your verified present, even though I'm an adult, I pay a little bit of a pay eight dollars.

Let's say I'm a kid.

I pay you eight dollars.

Let's say you're a kid.

Let's say it.

You're a kid.

Thank you.

He's a kid.

Thanks.

And let's say I pay you eight dollars and I get my verified present from you.

And then I don't like it.

Yeah.

Can I get a refund and get my eight dollars back?

I'm eight dollars.

And is this a monthly eight dollar fee because Christmas is only December?

Or do you get a present every month?

You, it's, is this like one of those?

We're starting to see some holes in one of those boxes that you get sent every, every month with stuff that you'll like in it.

No, that's the whole point of the verified present.

It's the thing that you wanted.

So if you don't like it, that's on you.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

That's not off brand or anything like that.

Like if you, you want an iPhone and you get an iPhone, it's not your phone or something.

If you, there have, there may be instances where someone asked for an iPhone and they get a razor and it's not even a flip room, but a scooter.

Oh, see.

But, and do they hold it up to their ear and try to talk into it?

I don't care what they do, but if they pay eight dollars, they will get the iPhone they ask for.

Okay.

So they can do whatever they want with the present for eight dollars except make fun of you.

You mustn't make fun of me.

What songs make fun of Santa?

Let's all of them.

All of them.

Let's talk.

Here comes Santa Claus.

Santa baby's a little spicy.

Right down Santa Claus.

He's gonna fuck Santa Claus.

He's a married man.

It implies that he would step out of the bonds of marriage.

It implies a moral feeling.

Here comes Santa Claus.

Just talks about the guys coming down Santa Claus Lane.

What's wrong with that?

There's no Santa Claus Lane.

It's rubbing his face in it.

Then no one has named a street after Santa Claus.

Okay.

I'm sure there's one in Finland where Santa Claus is originally from.

That's Santa Claus.

Different guy.

What?

That's a different guy?

I thought there was one per world.

The U-Lads?

Yes.

The U'll Cat.

He prowls the earth and he eats wicked children.

Listen, you don't even want to get into the Scandinavian Christmas stuff.

It's weird over there.

Krampus?

I'm part of the Scandinavian.

So please, that's your insulting my people now.

Then you should know.

Which part?

Am I writing a song about it?

Take it easy.

Oh boy.

I'm out of the body.

Oh.

Blower half.

Okay.

Well, I don't think this is gonna work.

Honestly, I mean, first of all, people are gonna make fun of you.

Santa, look, you're fat.

You're doing it right now.

You're not getting the present you want.

You're old.

You're fat.

You're not giving presents to adults anyway.

So we can say whatever you like.

Not now.

You're not being very jolly.

I'll tell you that much.

No, I'm not.

Thank you for the compliment.

You gotta be jolly.

I have not a compliment.

No.

I'm talking about your moods.

I didn't skip gym day.

You're not having fun.

Look, you're just, you're such an easy target.

Please, you know what I mean?

Boy, please.

You must believe in me.

Because you would profit from this as well.

As my client, you will get a percentage of $1.

Wait, is that a manager works?

So a manager reps a bunch of people and gets 10% from them and then shares it with all of the clients.

So if one of the clients isn't working a lot, he still gets or she or they get 10% from the client.

Managers, by the way, do you think the children paying me $8 on my clients?

Because they're not.

Managers should only take 10 clients.

I agree.

You know, they get 1% from each.

Unless you're me.

No, they should take 10% from each.

But if they take more than 10 clients, then they're making like 20, you know, double what, you know what I mean?

It doesn't make any sense.

Like managers who are richer than you.

Get the fuck out of it, boy.

Geez, my boy, listen, you will make so much money from Christmas now.

And all you must, isn't about profit, Sam.

Shut the fuck up.

Okay.

So all you must do is on your show, your Christmas show, you sing here, come Santa Claus.

But you take out the part about Santa Claus Lane.

Is that the only objection?

I have to scan through the rest of the lyrics and see.

I think that's what I call this here, I call this right down.

I call this Lane.

He's he's got toys for boys and girls and boys.

And he's doing it all again.

Something like that.

Let me look these up.

And all you have to do is just sing here, come Santa Claus with revised lyrics and you have to deliver the presents to all the boys.

What about I have to wait a while.

Wait a while.

Hold on.

Wait, what about I thought, what is, I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus.

I don't like that because it implies that I'm kissing people's mothers when of course it is about a deceitful father.

I have to be me.

Hold on.

I have to deliver the presents.

Yes, my boy.

Doesn't that sound fun?

No, it doesn't sound fun.

Do I get any of the presents?

You have no magic to give.

I have no magic.

You're just saying I have the magic of Christmas.

That would take me more than a year to deliver all those.

Way more than a year but steps are calm.

Couldn't even do that.

But think of all the money that's coming in from these hate documents.

I have a life I know life anymore.

How do you, how much life do you have now?

Oh, wow.

That's a good point.

Thank you, my boy.

We are the same.

It's a lot of Christmas lyrics.

First of all, there's a whole intro verse or intro lyric.

What do we think about this?

Everybody be quiet.

No, no.

All the time for the story.

Speaking of Christmas spirit, each year out in Hollywood, California, they've...

Wait, what?

This begins with speaking of Christmas spirit?

Yeah.

Whether people were or not.

It's rude of a song to do that, isn't it?

Is this maybe a specific guy?

Did it on a TV show?

No, these are...

I mean, it's Gene Autry.

I think he probably did it.

No, this is a show.

I don't think this song, anytime anyone sings it, begins with speaking of Christmas.

You know how when you listen to a standard, they usually cut off the intro?

I...

Hey, my boy.

I know what an intro to a song is.

Okay.

I'm saying somebody transcribed this from like an old radio broadcast and the actual lyrics do not begin with speaking of Christmas spirit.

Mackereli here, no corrections.

I'm taking my boy.

You and I, we are the same.

All right, let's just cut to the chase.

Which again, is what you want to do in a movie.

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane, Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers.

Can I stop you, my boy?

Yeah.

Now I want to hear the rest of the preamble.

I don't want to say it.

Please.

Okay.

Speaking of Christmas spirit, each year out in Hollywood, California, they've what they call the Santa Claus parade.

A few years ago, I was writing in this parade.

What do you think the tune is to that?

Okay, Mickey.

You're right.

Maybe you're right.

But it's written like a poem in these lyrics online.

Try to sing it though.

Try to sing it.

Major Bob, you're fired.

Oh, I'm having a hard to tell.

I'm sorry, I don't have a major problem on it.

Oh, oh, oh good.

That was close with my boy.

Okay, that was two points.

All right, look, we have to take a break, Major Bob.

Do you stick around or do I have to call you Santa Claus or the rest of the show or?

It would help the business.

Okay, sure.

For it.

Christian, can you stick around?

I'm invested.

All right, we have a budding artist.

We have a mythical creature.

We'll have more comedy bang bang after this.

Oh, comedy bang bang.

Okay, here's the last lyric of here comes Santa Claus.

He is a miracle come to all if we just follow the light.

So let's give thanks to the Lord above.

Because Santa Claus comes tonight.

I'm okay with that.

You're all right with this?

Get him.

Jesus.

He's very very.

He should think.

He doesn't mention Jesus specifically.

Do you think that he's like, hey, leave me out of this?

You can believe in whoever you want to believe.

He's weird about his birthday.

Some people are.

Yeah.

Anyway, Santa Claus is here, AKA major Bob.

Ooh.

It's not the right emphasis on the right syllables.

Christian Brunis here, the recruit.

December 16th on Netflix.

All eight dropping at the same time.

I believe all eight are dropping hot December 16th.

Ooh, and you have about nine days until Christmas to kind of get your affairs in order and get washed all those eight episodes.

And watch it before.

Before you get too busy.

Yeah.

Well, wonderful.

Well, we need to get to our next guest.

He's a budding artist.

And I don't know whether he's been on the show before.

But let's just introduce him.

Please welcome Team Giger.

Hi, guys.

Okay.

So what's screwing?

That's a teen catchphrase.

Uh, hi, Giger.

Team Giger.

Team Giger, please.

Team Giger.

And thank you.

You're welcome.

Um, how are you, Team Giger?

I couldn't be better.

We've met before?

Yes.

I explained.

Okay.

So in real life, I died, right?

H-H-R Giger, the artist who is probably most famous for doing, uh, Deborah Harry's for solo album, Koo-Hoo.

Yes.

And the ectomorph.

Sure.

Jesus Christ.

Sorry.

Oh, it's okay.

I forgive you.

Co-spusters and alien are almost the same movie.

Are they not?

I think so.

They may as well be.

I agree.

I mean, only a couple of years separate them.

It's got people scared in both of them.

Oh, oh.

It was practically the same.

Glazer guns.

Yeah.

Laser guns.

Yes.

Don't cross the streams.

That's only in one of them.

Are there laser guns in Twinkie?

No.

The big Twinkie.

The full trifles and flamethrowers, the flamen duffers.

So it was science fiction, but it wasn't that weird.

Yeah.

That's right.

It's not crazy.

I remember the first movie, so many lights when they go into the cockpit of the ship.

Santa, big fad.

Oh, thank you.

I'd like to give you my eight dollars now for a gift, a very specific gift.

What do you want, Tingy Giger?

I would like an eight dollar gift card to marine layer clothing.

Oh, my boy.

These I can do for you.

Okay.

A marine layer clothing.

Yeah.

Tingy Giger's trying out colors.

Oh, yeah.

So why don't you just spend eight bucks at that store?

Well, then it wouldn't be a gift.

Fair.

That's a good point.

So tell us you died.

H.R. Giger, you passed away a few years, but you'd been on the show many times.

Yes, Dr. Rev. Parsonini brought me back to life.

Oh, that's right.

And then what happened?

And it kind of possessed his body sort of supernatural way.

Oh, right, right, right.

I remember this.

I went through some things and like Spock and Star Trek the fifth.

I get reborn, but I have to grow again from a baby accelerated.

And now I'm in my teen years.

So go start three.

Go start three.

Yes.

Where's Matt Gorley when you want a correction?

Right here.

No corrections.

This guy's got it, but I'm saying it was wrong.

I still, I think you've got it.

Who are you?

He's in the band Townland.

Oh, great band.

Oh, you like Townland?

Yeah, they have a Christmas single up.

Oh, they do.

Oh, maybe we'll hear that a little later.

I would love it.

And that's just me.

Yeah.

I'm Dean Giger.

Hi, Jimmy.

Hey, Jimmy.

Oh, geez.

Get in here.

What's up?

That's all it takes is just to say get in here.

Hey, man, nobody ever has.

You just barged in every day.

I'll ask.

You have to invite the vampire in the shimmy in.

That's right.

One does you right, the other does you wrong.

I don't want to suck your blood.

I was just humming my favorite tune, The Intro to Send the Closest Coming to Town.

Oh, I love it.

Speaking of the Christmas spirit, I was recently hosting a parade with my people.

It's so catchy.

I can't get out of my head.

It's an earworm.

I almost don't want to sing the rest of this out.

I swear to the rest of this song, right?

Go screw.

Teens are great.

Hot topic.

Yeah.

Shriey, do you have to go?

I already went.

Go back.

So you, much like Spock in Star Trek 3, you reincarnated yourself into a teenage boy.

Yes.

And so now I'm learning all over again how to be an artist, how to be a human.

So you don't retain that information from life to life?

No, you have to do it all over again.

Okay.

Yes.

And very much like my first time through my mother and my soon to be wife, Carmen Maria Shefalaquik are really shame.

But you're getting back together with her?

It seems to be some kind of vicious circle.

Won't she be robbing the cradle in a way?

I mean, she's much older than you.

Yeah, she's really old now.

How old are you?

You're teen?

I'm 13.

Oh, no.

I don't know if that's legal, but you're growing fast.

And if you're a chartkeeper, I mean, come on.

Yeah, that's a good point.

It's like I'm famous weirdo, famous oddball artist.

Yeah, famous mother fixation.

Yeah, a lot of penises in all of your art as well.

If you can get them.

Yeah.

So is that nature or nurture or nature or Nietzsche?

It's nature, nurture and Nietzsche.

I love this game show.

Okay.

Let's see.

When you stare into the abyss, the abyss stares back.

Nietzsche.

Correct.

He forgot to buzz in.

Oh, so I get the points.

Okay.

Here's the first question.

You're born with a chemical imbalance.

Oh, can I play?

Yes.

Oh, okay.

More of the chemical amounts.

I'm going to say nature.

Correct.

Your mother ties your diaper in with a bungee cord so as to keep it watertight, but turns out constricts your lowers so that you always have a bit of a vesicle clog and the bottleneck.

Santa Claus.

Yes.

And nurture.

Yes.

And first hand experience.

I have one.

I have a question.

It's not puree.

That's the Santa Claus.

Santa Claus.

Yes.

Naughty by Nietzsche.

Exactly.

I like to be naughty.

Don't take my word on it.

He dollars is eight dollars, my boy.

So really even the naughty list gets presents if you pay eight dollars?

Who is naughty?

Who is nice?

I'm worried that I'm going to be paying this eight dollars and impersonating kids and then, you know, and then suddenly the kids who are being impersonated.

They don't get presents.

If you send an additional twenty dollars, then you will be, it will be super, super verified.

It goes up to twenty, much like when Congress was giving us that money.

Twenty dollars additional.

Oh, okay.

Yes.

This time it doesn't work in your favor.

I don't have that much money.

I haven't sold my first painting yet.

Can we see any of your current art?

Yes.

What do you have?

Well, I've been doing a lot of stuff on my iPad, which I couldn't.

I'm just looking for.

Yeah.

So here, I'll take this out.

Let me swipe through.

What's that on your iPad?

Oh, it's swiping goo.

It's a conductant to make swiping more difficult.

Oh, yeah.

You're getting no traction on that.

I can't count the page, but it's a fun try-in.

Yeah.

So you've invented swiping goo?

Well, I sort of secreted it.

Oh, boy.

You know, chicken or the egg.

You are thirteen, so that's cancer.

Yeah.

It's a bit of, it's viscous for the most part.

Oh, I'll take it times, but kind of like- Let's get through the viscous.

Nature.

Yeah.

Okay.

Do you have the iPad open yet?

Yes.

Do you want me to try?

Could you?

Yeah.

You don't want to touch that, do you?

Yeah, I do.

I find if you use a pencil eraser, you get a little more traction.

Okay.

Here is a number two tycoon, the roga.

Okay.

But I also get to get some pencil goo.

There we go.

It's open now.

There we go.

Okay.

That's a painting of just a whole hatchery full of...

...tubes.

Not tube hatchery.

It's sort of a female sluice way as if they always say, for European tubes, but they don't say how many.

But I says to myself, asking the fifth question, what if there were multitudes of fallopian tubes?

Yeah.

So like the babies, the spermazoa would go in and it could go to so many.

So many.

Yes.

Yeah, yeah.

That's the problem with fallopian tubes.

Say how many?

That's exactly right.

I think it's a problem.

I will grow up to legislate.

Say how many tubes you got, ladies.

Be proud.

Yeah.

Mine.

Where is a button on your clothing?

Yes.

Right?

Yes.

I mean, I'm guessing it's the same amount of tubes with everybody.

So maybe we'll just know.

Who do you think you are calling how many people tubes have?

Wow.

This is Christian Brun.

Yes.

Hi.

Oh, I know who you are.

Oh, it's not out yet though.

I got a special sneak peek.

Oh.

Yeah.

Perhaps you remember him as Constable John Stuckel.

From the Hossum Thebrac.

The Great Mouse Detective.

Yes.

That's right.

Hossum Thebrac Corporation.

Yes.

That's the one.

Yes.

I love you.

Listen, I think, you know, I thank you.

I appreciate that.

How many tubes you got, smart guy?

Hey, if you're...

I mean, you know, all my body.

If you're looking over there, try to talk it to the mic.

Who me?

Yeah.

Oh, what's this do?

I'm just talking to you.

Yeah, it amplifies your voice.

It does.

Yeah.

He's 13.

I realize, Scott.

I know.

You have a lot of mic experience.

You're learning everything over again.

I have learned it so much.

Harginger was so good on the mic.

Was he?

Yeah, he was amazing.

How about...

So is that nature or nurture?

It must be nurture.

He's got to be nurture.

I can't hear anybody.

I know you're looking at no one and you're just talking to the ceiling.

Okay.

Let's go around the table.

How many tubes we got?

I couldn't even tell you.

I mean, I got the main one, obviously.

The main bed.

I'm old enough to know that.

Yeah, you are, buddy.

Hot topping.

You know how to high-five too.

Yeah.

It's a powerful one.

Ouch.

I'm a fuck.

But high-fiving goo.

Yeah.

Oh, thank you.

Appreciate that.

My boy, do nostrils count as tubes?

Oh.

Good question.

Gonna give it to you.

Okay, but does it count as two tubes?

Then do your ear canals also count as two?

Here's what we're going with.

Each ear canal separate tube.

Nostrils eventually bottleneck it to one tube.

That's right.

The mouth, they connect to the mouth.

This is what I'm saying.

Yeah.

Everything runs into one tube.

They are the same.

But not the ear canals.

They go straight to the big guy, the brain.

And that's a bunch of noodles.

That's a bunch of tubes.

Noodles.

You have brains or noodles?

Oh, boy.

You got me there.

That's like, is it all one noodle?

Like your guts, putting your head?

Is it a serious question?

Yeah.

Is it?

Yes.

Can you unravel the brain into one tube?

It's a lot.

How many tons of baby in the trap your brain with yourself?

Wouldn't you love to do that with like one of the Xenomorphs?

Oh, man.

Need a brain with a Xenomorph?

Now you're talking my jazz.

Is the whole head of a Xenomorph brains?

Yes.

Is that why they're so smart?

Okay.

The world question at a time, please.

I think we asked them one at a time.

Look, are you doing stuff that teenagers do?

This is what I'm concerned about.

You're growing up too fast because you're already drawing like fallopian tubes and you know, I see on your iPad you're trying to recreate the famous painting that you put into the Dead Kennedy's Franken Christ album.

That's the one, man.

They got them sued.

I'm trying to remake the porn.

And Tipper Gore, create the PMRC.

Always.

All the corn microphones.

Right.

This is always on my crust.

Is Tipper still?

Yeah.

Yeah, you don't hear much from Tipper these days.

No, you do if you're HR gig or teen gig or she's still trying to keep me down one foot on my neck that Tipper.

Oh my God.

Yeah, but I walk her on Instagram.

That might help or TikTok, whatever you're on.

TikTok?

Snapchat?

I'm on it all.

I'm a team.

Yes.

Snapchat.

Are you doing anything team like this?

This is what I'm asking.

You're skating.

Yeah.

Skating.

Figure skating.

Oh, lovely.

I don't know that teams are figure.

That's the Swiss way.

You're doing it?

Yeah, very much so.

Can you do a double axle?

I could do as many as you want.

Triple Southtown.

How are you?

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

I do a little choo-choo.

You're meaning a train?

You imitate a train out there on the ice?

What I do.

You can't just say I do a little choo-choo and then look at me.

You gotta follow it up for something.

Don't make me guess.

I stand by that.

I do a little choo-choo.

All right.

Enough said.

Why don't you tell me what it is?

That's my guy.

Good point.

Do you have friends?

I'm getting some.

Good.

I'm looking around.

Who's your best friend?

Well, I don't have a best friend, but I have some.

I have some that I have some in order.

Oh.

Not a lot of people want to hang out with me.

Well, I mean, you're weirdo.

Oh.

You know, I mean, I can't say that to a teenager that's going to offend me.

Oh, my boy.

What am I supposed to say to a teenager?

He's so good.

Fucking encourages not counting.

You say that teenagers.

Hey, it gets better.

It gets better.

How soon?

Because it just got pretty bad.

Yeah, I understand.

But you're growing faster than most teens, so it'll get better faster and sooner.

I believe Santa Claus has.

You can have friends, Teen Giger, of course.

I can't.

For a mere $28.

I can bring you all the friends you desire.

You guys have a similar thing going on.

Oh.

Just vocally.

Really?

Well, they're kind of European.

It sounds foreign to you.

Well, you're Dutch.

I am famously from Head and Field in New Jersey.

I have that field.

Yes.

Michael Myers, but not the right state.

Exactly.

Oh, he and I, we are the same.

Don't be the same as you.

So much about Michael Myers.

Well, let me tell you that.

Okay, here's my question.

No, finally.

Oh, I thought that was me talking.

Oh, who am I now?

This time, starring Christopher Walken.

What?

Is it the movie?

What is happening right now?

What are you doing?

You're newtles.

I have not formed yet.

You're newtles have not formed yet.

You don't know how to like talk on a program.

No, I've having a hard time because everything's scrambled and it's accelerated.

So I'm already turned 15 since we've talked.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

Will you be 18 soon?

I hope unless I die.

That's true.

You could die anytime and between now and anytime.

I think in about 20, 20 minutes.

You're probably with us, as a matter of fact.

What?

It's stuck in his head.

He's going to need therapy, man.

Thank you.

He's going to need therapy.

Do you think you can fit some therapy in in the next 20 minutes?

You got it, Ben.

You do it?

Sure, I'll do it.

Okay.

So how are you feeling?

Well, I feel a little insecure because my best friend Scott told me, A, don't look at me with a chichu and B, I'm a little weird.

I don't know that I'm your best friend, Hargi.

A lot of people come in here wanting to be my best friend and I, you know, they want hugs.

They say they miss me.

Oh, no, I'm sorry.

Are you having a heart attack now?

No.

I don't have to start being nice to everyone on this show, do I?

Come on.

Christian, you're not going to heart attack.

Oh, you're never nice to me.

So don't change.

Oh, you're making me pass a mochi egg.

Oh, no.

Yeah.

A good at comma.

Oh, dear.

Oh, boy.

Look, HR.

Yeah.

I don't know how to help you, but.

How about just a high five?

Okay, you're very good at that.

Put the go away though.

Hard to do.

Frankly, hard to do.

Oh, yeah.

I'll put on this weather resistant glove.

Oh, okay.

Good.

All right, let's hear.

Here we go.

Oh, man.

That was loud.

It had two sounds.

Yes.

It was like a high five.

The best high five.

That's right.

You ever high-fived over the Grand Canyon?

Sounds amazing.

So.

Oh, you have more.

No.

Okay.

Do you want to take it with me?

We might have to take a break if that's okay.

I would love it.

You would love it, really.

Yeah.

We have a mythical creature coming up.

I know you're probably interested in those.

I mean, Santa Claus already is one.

You draw them.

Maybe this person will be my best friend.

I hope so.

Yeah, that would be amazing.

All right.

When we come back, we have a mythical creature.

We have more from Major Bob A.K. Santa Claus.

We have more from Christian Brun.

We have more from Teen Giga.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Speaking of Christmas spirit each year.

Okay.

You would.

Okay.

Yes.

They've got what they call the Santa Claus parade.

Does it not look like it could be the intro though for just the way it's formatted on the Internet.

It's parade.

I saw smiles on thousands of faces both young and older like waiting for a look at that most popular man all over the world.

I can hear you.

Yeah.

Now.

So catchy.

Here comes Santa Claus.

Oh, I know Santa Claus.

Merry Christmas to all and to some a good night.

Exactly.

Oh.

Some who pay eight dollars.

Yes.

Or 28 to be super verified.

How are your sales going by the way?

Good.

I'm glad I did.

I like it.

Yeah.

I'm happy.

Okay.

It's working and it's great.

Okay.

All right.

Good.

Well, welcome back to the show.

We have Christian Brun over here from Netflix is the recruit.

And so weird spelling that word is spelled weird, isn't it?

The recruit?

Yeah.

Or it should be it should be R E C R O O T. Instead, it's U I T.

How would you spell my last name?

I am recruit.

Oh.

Wait.

Vin Diesel just walking here.

And now he's got you.

It's Vin Diesel, the new Shimi.

He's gone.

We also have a major Bob over here.

Santa Claus.

We also have Teen Giger.

Hi.

Oh.

Tiger.

Yeah.

You're right.

Well, I've been having trouble because I have so much emotions testosterone.

Yeah.

As troture own everything goes around.

So I don't know whether to say what I'm thinking or think what I'm saying.

I would say the latter.

Okay.

Yeah.

Think about what you're saying and then say it.

Okay.

Yeah.

Well, what if we didn't have teeth?

Well, we did have little sharpened dice.

And so every time you chewed, you were you were basically doing a gamble whether the food would choke you or not.

No, thank you.

Okay.

So go back to the other way.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

With teeth.

Yeah.

Oh, I thought I thought.

What do you think?

Teen Giger, don't get frustrated.

You're okay.

No.

You're all right.

I know you've you just got reborn and you haven't been on a podcast in a while.

There's a lot going on in your personal life, it seems.

I sometimes sweat through a blackhead.

Ooh.

And then that gives a type of oil, but like a crude oil.

Yeah.

It's a black gold.

Texas tea.

Yeah, obviously.

But it's Texas tea, but sexist me.

Oh, no.

Yes.

With the minions.

Do you know the minions?

They took me personally.

Two of the three big ones.

Yeah.

One time.

Because they're too cute.

No, that was Groot.

We all agree that they're funny, right?

Yeah.

Groot design.

Yeah, Groot.

All right, well speaking of the minions, we need to get to our next guest.

Please.

And I don't know what they have dominion over, but they are a mythical creature.

Please welcome Giannis Pilates.

Oh, wow.

Oh, no.

Oh, my God.

Wow.

What just happened?

Oh, no.

Ah.

Oh, no.

Ah.

Don't be afraid of me, Scots.

My emotional presence is terrifying, isn't it?

Ah, wait, you just had not to be afraid of you, so I wasn't.

But now you're saying you're terrifying?

I quite intend here, noisily, with my herbs underfoot, raring upon my mighty hunters.

You have like one bottle for a foot.

And it sounds like a basket full of marking pens as another foot?

Shush, little one.

You are the little one from the province.

You're only like six four.

I'm humongouser than that.

I'm six foot son.

Oh.

And I'm half man, half sensor.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Turn this back.

Wait, I said it wrong.

Wait, I'm familiar with this.

I'm familiar with the half man, that's a thought.

It's three fourths man.

Yeah, that would be three fourths man.

You're mostly man, you just have like a bottle for a foot and a basket of marking pens for another foot.

No, one quarter horse, three quarters man.

So below the knees, is that what you're saying?

And horse for you, the torso of a man for a hand, and then also human feet on the end of the horse legs.

The heads of a man, the body, but the first half of a part man.

The pecs.

One leg horse.

Oh, okay.

The feet of a man.

The eyes of a man.

Okay.

The other leg.

Oh, we're just going part by part.

Of a man.

Like mostly men so far.

The tail of a horse.

Oh, you have a horse now?

What's your dingle?

Penis of a man.

Bottom part.

Top part horse.

Oh, wait.

When you say top part.

Wait.

Do you mean the head or do you mean everything about the balls?

So your part, vegetable.

Animal man and mineral.

Schlamieus Schlamazus.

Closent, Fefergocorporated.

Scott, I've come here clanging your jaw down with my herbs, knocking everything about and scaring you and all your little friends.

I was here.

I saw it.

You don't have to recap.

I've come to find you, little one.

Oh.

You're the little boy from the property.

Again, you're slightly taller than me.

What do you need from me?

My kind is going extinct.

You're kind of.

What?

You're kind of going staid.

You're getting into staid.

In a while.

My kind is going extinct.

Oh, extinct.

Extinct.

Are you doing a pun?

See.

I'm the last of my half.

No.

Smart half-sunt war.

No, I'm so sorry.

And the prophecy said one little boy, very tall, sad little boy.

Sad little boy, sad personality.

Could help me.

That table, right?

Scott, hop on my rump and ride with me to the forest.

Wait, hold on.

I don't know how I'm supposed to help you.

I'm going in things.

What?

But I don't know what else I could do other than have sex with...

Oh, wait.

No, no, no, no, no.

No, that's not what I'm asking.

Scott, what do I'm asking for?

Hop on my rump and I'll ride the hill.

Again, it sounds like that's what you're asking for.

I'll draw you to the forest where you will be the chosen little boy to remove the rock from the stone.

The rock from the stone.

Wake of.

As legend has this.

Web forest?

The forest in Mufu Fufu Fonsia.

My lands.

How long of a trip is this?

Because I still need to get up to Big Bear this afternoon.

I was already surfing in the morning.

The long trip will take Sencha-Kos Lane.

Oh, okay.

You know that street?

Hop on my rump and I'll rump you down it.

I do not want to hop on your rump.

You must.

Could we just...

Could we get it like a tandem motorcycle or something where we could do side by side?

The rock of this tells the sad little boy must rump on the rump of the last remaining Sencha-wah.

I'm familiar with this.

You have to hop on the rump and then rump on the hum.

I don't know.

You kind of...

By the way, I mean, it's not a very big shelf down there.

I mean, it doesn't look like I would be able to fit.

It's a very skinny ass.

It's what I'm trying to say.

It's half centaur ass and half cubed ass.

One of the cheeks is humongoid.

The other is a...

One is not a...

It's enough for you skinny little one.

Please.

Please, my kind is going instinct because we're being killed and hunted for our powers.

Oh, wait, you have powers?

Yes.

What are they?

More than I could have lists.

Well, lists are...

Wister, couple.

Okay, I'll list three.

Oh, good.

First, we can run faster than even...

As fast as I'm the fastest man.

Like, you seen Bolt?

Yes.

Okay.

But less fast than him, but almost quite as fast.

Oh, okay.

So, almost as fast as you're saying Bolt.

That's impressive at one.

Oh, legs!

You can almost run as fast as you're saying Bolt.

Yes.

Yeah.

Are horses faster than you saying Bolt?

Yes.

But that's a full horse.

Full run power.

So, this is not that great.

I have the feet of a man.

You can't run as fast as it was.

The head of a man.

Okay, I just remember all these.

The tail of a horse.

What are your other two powers?

Second power.

I can say a funny fact at any time.

Go, go, go!

This three.

Go, please!

Three facts.

One.

Strawberries are the only fruit with the seeds on the outside.

Two.

And pastate building is taller than our other buildings.

Three.

Banana is the only food that's truly yellow.

It's all the yellow foods are just...

Truly yellow.

Scott, the yellow of a banana.

20-a-chips?

No food.

Damn, over the pound.

Okay, my third skill.

I can, well, and any cental can do it.

We have raw, dripping.

What?

Slexopio.

And we can bet any woman we lay eyes on.

Go for it.

There's no women here.

Oh, that's right.

I'm kind of on the verge.

So unusual for comedy bang bang.

Well...

I have bed almost every actress.

Nicki Minaj.

Bob is trying it.

Great actress.

Haley Joel's Nicki Minaj.

Haley Joel's husband.

But unfortunately none have the pussy of a cental.

And I can't...

I can't procreate to keep us from going in science.

Well, here's Mike Anundra.

You've mentioned that people are killing your cat.

That's my name, Mike Anundra.

Oh, really?

Mike.

I'm sorry, I thought your name was Peatus Pilates.

My human name is Mike Anundra.

Oh, okay.

I'm a cental.

So you're three quarters, Mike Anundra.

And a quarter, Peatus Pilates.

Mine?

Anundra.

Here's my issue.

You say people are killing your kind to get their powers.

The police.

The police are haunting us.

Yes.

Oh.

Just the police.

What do you mean just the police?

Well, I mean, why do the police want your powers?

Because they're jealous.

They're purely just for jealousy's sake.

Yes.

Okay, here's my thing, though.

You're implying that if I were to kill you, I'd get your powers and you just said that I could have sex with any actress I wanted.

So why aren't I killing you right now?

Because there's only one white security sensor.

What is it?

And if you haven't read the Bible by Joseph Smith, you won't know what it is.

You're a Mormon centaur?

Every centaur is.

Oh.

Every centaur is a Mormon LDS.

Yes, Latter Day Saints.

Are we a LDS anymore?

I heard you weren't allowed to say that.

I can say whatever I want.

Peace, fuck shit.

Oh, okay.

Look, just tell us the way to kill you.

Okay, you have to pull my tail.

And it's attached to my butt, which is attached to my heart.

And all the needles will come out of my body immediately and fall slop on the floor.

Oh.

Please don't do it.

Yeah, I mean, I kind of want to do it.

Oh.

It kind of seems like he wants us to.

I'm the last one and you're the little boy meant to save me out of the gym.

How can I save you if I jump on your rump?

Get on my rump.

Okay, yeah.

No, I know the rump.

Or ride into the forest and you'll pull the stone from the rock.

The stone from the rock.

No, it was a rock from the stone.

Matt Gourley here doing a caricature of Giger.

Hey, don't make fun of my guestine Giger.

Sorry.

You and he, you are the same.

It's happening.

Scott, if you won't do it, I'll take this little boy.

Oh, me?

Okay.

Give me half a chance.

I'm a runp hopper from way back.

Have you often a rump before?

Yeah.

Then you're tainted slots.

Oh, no, I haven't.

Hey, don't sludge a my guest.

Sorry.

I said to a don't be like the bed women who have never been bedded before.

Please, my gosh.

Bob, the Streisins.

They're gorgeous.

They were over, I believe, Haley, but they were over.

Just wants another fun fact.

Yeah.

I'm a little bit nervous.

Yeah.

Go ahead, take him and I want to kill you.

Well, so this appearance didn't turn out the way you hold.

You have to run fast enough to catch me.

How fast can you run?

Almost as fast as you say.

What?

You say you say you bolt.

And you say bolt is faster than you say.

Yeah.

You are the same.

So faster than you saying bolt.

Exactly.

And now I just run 60 kilometers.

Oh, but I've seen some who say bolt pretty quickly.

Does he count?

Yeah, from that Heidi hole.

Oh, his layout is a spider hole.

Yeah.

Good.

Try.

You think he called it a Heidi hole?

I do.

Yeah.

He's like spite.

Yeah.

Well, come here.

No.

What are you going to do?

Okay.

I'll put my hands in my pockets.

Don't look at my wet tail.

Why is it so wet?

It's dripping when I pissed on it.

That's all schools do it.

Okay.

We don't use toilet, Scott.

We pissed down the fur of our tails.

I don't know that I want to grab this.

And the first door that it sucks it up.

I'll do it.

You'll do it.

All right.

Yeah.

Let me take off my weather resistant glove.

Okay.

Is this like Avatar where we will braid our tails into each other only.

I don't have a tail, but I kind of do.

No.

I'll put my rump and I'll rump you into oblivion.

Oh.

We'll get to the forest and we'll do the rock.

Come on.

Let's go.

Heroi hop.

Me.

Where did they go?

Mostly running around the room.

They're just running around the room.

It's 60 kilometers an hour.

Oh, the hop of the Heradagio.

We've arrived.

What?

We've still listened to the sounds of the forest.

The magical birds shift.

You never ran out.

You never ran out the doors.

No, the door has been shut.

The forest is in our imagination.

Oh, yes.

I see it.

Do you see it?

Everyone try and listen.

And everyone hear a different kind of sound of bird now.

Choo-choo-choo.

Choo-choo-choo-choo.

Hi.

Welcome to the rainforest cafe.

That's my bird.

Choo-choo-choo.

Oh, there it is.

Do you see it, little one?

Yes.

The rock and the stone.

Okay.

Can you pull it?

I will try.

Try to wank it out.

All of your mites.

How did that rock get in that stone?

Legend has it.

It was put there by Princess Diana 50,000 years ago.

Princess Diana was an immortal?

Well, in our world, she is a pig.

She's an hour, a different one from yours.

Oh, okay.

Multiverse, meaning the same Princess Diana.

No, she's a pig named you.

She's queen of the pigs.

Oh, okay.

But unlike our Princess Diana.

Our Princess Diana was not queen of the pigs.

She wasn't.

What disrespect have you put on her name?

Sorry, no, she was.

She was merely Princess of the pigs.

No, she was not.

She had nothing poor sign about her.

All right, so what do we do now?

Okay, thank little one with all of your mites.

By the powers of the band corn.

I summon thee.

Hard rock.

Death rock.

Metal rock.

All rock.

Mineral and quartz.

Come with me.

Like meld brooks have the Schwartz.

Oh my god, he.

Oh, no.

He did it.

I did it.

I'm the chosen one.

You've done it.

Now you must procreate with me to make more sense.

I knew it was getting there.

The whole pulling the rock from the...

That had nothing to do with it.

I did the rock in the sand, didn't I?

Oh, wait.

You want someone to bone you?

You took me into boning you.

Wait, you did too.

In fact, we've already done it.

That's what the rump ride was.

Oh, see, I knew I didn't want to get up.

Has my seed found purchase in your soil?

You see, crawled up my wet tail and into my bowl and out my eyes.

Is that the same thing?

Yes.

Okay.

So, are we expecting?

Yes, I'm pregnant.

Wow, congratulations.

Congratulations, my boy.

What about me?

I can't accept it here too.

You're not pregnant, though.

No, but I mean it couldn't have happened without me.

Is that why you're on that big fat belly?

The belly of a man.

The eyes of a horse.

The feet of a hoof.

Yes, my.

The tail of a horse.

We know the...

But maybe the womb of a woman?

The womb of a woman horse.

A woman horse.

A filly, a mare.

A mare of e sound.

Oh!

Speaking of the fillies.

Yeah.

The eldest baby will come out in 45 seconds.

Oh, whoa, whoa.

Wait, how much horses or centaur is going to be in this one?

Is this going to be like more than three quarters?

Oh, boy.

Because I'm half mad.

Yeah, two.

So, you're three quarters man, so this will be...

What do you?

Under present man?

No, I don't go jump into no conclusions.

Okay, what's other parts are you?

I'm 73% man.

Okay.

Eight percent woman.

Nine percent.

Go like a slime mold.

Okay, that's 94.

Okay, one percent, half percent milk.

Oh, oh.

So, one percent of half percent milk?

I didn't know they'd skin milk.

Yeah, skim milk.

Okay.

I thought it was two percent.

Okay.

Two point seven, three percent.

Just a marmalade, but take the color out.

Okay.

Yeah.

Then I'm a little bit napalm, a little bit rock and roll.

And then just finally the rest is just like...

Okay, so let's say you took play though.

Okay.

But you boiled it down, rendered the tallow out of it.

And then you put...

You're emptying an ink pen into that.

Could we have a name for that so we could just call it something?

There should be a name.

Shrimp.

So, I'm both...

Yes, dead left shrimp.

Okay.

Yes.

Everybody got it?

Okay, yeah.

I think so.

So this is going to be a healthy stew of a kid.

Oh, by the way, 45 seconds has elapsed.

It's coming!

Oh, my...

It should be here.

Where does it come out of?

Quick, hide under the table.

Oh, okay.

It's coming.

Hide under the table.

I'll sort the baby.

Nothing is more violent or ferocious than our awesome...

Oh, baby, here it comes.

Oh!

Oh, my God.

Oh!

Oh, my God!

It bit Christians penis on!

Oh!

Penis is on!

That penis was delicious!

Penis!

The baby's speech!

My baby boy!

What about my penis?

You have HR Geiger's accent.

Oh, look at my little one.

You must be my daddy.

I must be.

Hi.

You're not one of those things from nature that kills the parents, are you?

Hey, don't put any ideas in it.

Oh, yeah, just wanted to check.

Nature versus nurture, friend.

Why don't you suckle on one of these guys?

Oh, my God.

It's gonna bite it off.

That's what you're supposed to do.

You have so many teats.

Yes.

Those are surgical.

Huh?

How many boob jobs have you had?

Well, do you want to know the original real ones or the...

Just the fake ones.

To be totally family secret, some of these are borrowed.

Oh, okay, yeah.

Oh, boy.

Some are blue.

Can I get my penis back, please?

Oh, the penis will not be given back to you.

The baby is asleep.

Thank you all comrades for helping me.

Oh, shit.

Your copy is...

Wait a minute, it's back off.

No way.

I thought checking up with a copy of this.

No.

Oh, come on.

Get out of here.

Go back to Ruski.

Yeah.

I'm okay with it.

How are you going to get back to the comedy bang bang studio?

If not, but now I'm being on my romp then.

Oh, no.

I think we just close our eyes and imagine we're back.

That's not how it works.

You must get done back.

Wait, did I imagine my penis has been bitten off?

Let me take a look.

No, it's been...

No, Jesus.

It's gone.

It's still gone.

It's totally gone.

You better turn it cat bad, m-f-er.

Everyone quick a five-man romp stack on me.

We're not going to have sex with you.

Five-man romp stack.

Come on, just to get back to this studio game.

I'm game.

I can't.

I don't have a penis anymore.

If we go to the stack or upped up, who's over second stack?

I don't do pinkos.

I don't do sloppy fifths either.

Scott, if you leave you on this forest, Scott knows what's wrong.

Wait, where's this door leading?

This is where we're right next door to the studio.

Oh, rats.

All right, we're back.

Look, pianist, if you don't mind me calling you pianist, is it just pianist?

Yes, pianist pilates.

Thank you for coming on the show.

I'm glad you finally have an air.

I do.

An air to the hungry throne.

Hungry?

That's what it's called in the boofy of Bufancia.

Oh, okay.

Well, it's wonderful to know all these traditions.

Hi, is it called the hungry throne, I wonder?

Everyone who sits on this absolutely starving.

You think they wouldn't do it then?

Just because it's a...

Never mind.

It's a stupid island.

And you defecate and rid your bowels and so you can eat again in your hungry?

Yes.

Now, Scott, even though you ignored the prophecy, don't think it won't come for you.

I'll be back.

Uh, I'm not so sure about that.

You'll see what happens to you from ignoring the prophecy.

Bad stuff.

Bad stuff is gonna happen.

So, what's happening now?

Really?

Hopefully it won't happen until the plugs because we're coming up here on the plugs.

You'll feel it.

Okay, well...

It's deep in your plugs, Scott.

Deep inside the plugs?

I'm gonna feel something?

All right, well, let's check it out because we are running out of time.

We just have time for one final feature.

That's a little something called plugs.

This episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

I got to tell you, it won't seem to be.

Motherfucking plugs.

That's when I got this one, all for giving.

Back up in your way.

Back up in your comedy bang bang bang bang.

Motherfucking plugs.

Now's the time.

The time.

The time is now.

Just like you.

Just like you should.

You are the fucking ones.

That's that comedy bang bang bang.

All right, that was What's in the Bag by the titular creation of Adam.

I do believe the titular creation of Adam burned that on a CD and mailed it to us sometime in the last year.

So we just opened it.

Thank you so much to them.

Guys, what do we want to plug?

Obviously Santa Claus tis the season, as they say.

Yes, I'd like to plug, obviously, send $8 to Santa Claus.

Sure.

But also another client of mine named Paul Lefthumpkin says, is she with you too?

Yes, of course.

My boy.

You would hear you are the same.

Oh, that's right.

He has a show on December 18th called Veriotopia at Largroom in Highland Park.

Oh, that sounds fun.

Those are, is it a special holiday themed one?

It's a special holiday themed one.

That must be fun.

Maybe Santa Claus will be there.

Oh, yeah.

Not me.

Oh, the other one.

The real one.

He's got nothing to do now.

But that's get tickets at PaulLefthumpkins.com slash Lefthumpkins.

Hi!

All right, let's go and get it out.

Incredible.

And Christian, obviously, the recruit is out in a mere 11 days.

So soon.

The countdown has begun.

It has.

And right on the Netflix building, there's a clock.

That's right.

Season two in the works.

I mean, we hope, put your eyes on it.

Are you dead by the end of this?

I cannot say, but I do hope we get a second season.

So sounds like you live.

I don't know.

No, no, no, no, no.

All right.

Incredible.

Everybody watch.

And if, if you're bored, just leave it playing and walk away.

Yeah, that's right.

And rewind your parts and just watch those over and over.

Yeah, go watch Yay-ness.

And Team Giger, speaking of Vaines, what do you have to plug?

Well, okay.

So my client, Mac Gorely, he has a band called Townland.

Yeah, he's been in here several times.

Why doesn't he come in now?

I don't know.

Why doesn't he?

You got this, Giger.

You got this for me.

Okay, buddy.

I won't let you down.

Okay.

His band Townland has a new Christmas single called Christmas on the Rocks.

That's out now.

Where can people get it?

Oh, don't even forget about it because you could go on Spotify, Apple music, Amazon music, YouTube, title, all the Deezer.

Wow.

You, Deezer.

Yeah, that's real.

What about Deez?

Nuts.

Yeah.

Doesn't help when you're pointing down to your views.

You gave me a hint.

I'm losing the thread, Giger.

Sorry.

And you can buy it on Bandcamp to own it for your own.

Why don't we play it at the end of this show and people can hear it and then say like, Oh, I love that song so much and then they'll buy it.

That would be great.

Right, Matt?

I don't care.

Oh, I want you to play it.

I don't know why he doesn't.

What's wrong with Matt these days?

I don't know, man.

Hey, Shimi.

What's going on, dude?

I would play this.

Oh, I will, but yeah.

What do you play on it again?

You know.

Come on.

Oh, that's right.

And pianists, pianists, pianists.

What do you want to look like?

Piano music.

Oh my God.

You're right.
