Reggie Watts, my one-man bandleader and musical compatriot from the Comedy Bang Bang TV show.

Neil Campbell, my head writer from the Comedy Bang Bang TV show.

And me. What do we all have in common?

Well, it's the Comedy Bang Bang TV show! This Friday, July 12th on IFC at 10pm!

All three of us are here, we're all going to celebrate the premiere episode, all on this very special bonus episode!

All of that and more, all on today's...

♫ Comedy Bang Bang Theme Song ♫ Guess what, you guys? I went to the movies and none of you were there!

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Oh, thanks for that catch phrase submission!

Astronaut Down, Astronaut Down. I hope that's your real name, Astronaut Down.

Maybe it would be Astronaut Downs, would be a more likely real name.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang, we are here, this is the podcast, it is premiere week, guys!

Premiere week of the TV show, this Friday, 10pm IFC, our second season finally comes out.

The first episode, we have Andy Samberg, we have Jordan P eele of Key & Peele, we have Lance Reddick, we have Doug Benson, we have Adam Pally, Chelsea Peretti!

Oh, so many stars, Selma Blair, so many stars this Friday, we're very excited and to celebrate the show, I have two of my bros from the show here, on the show.

Have I said show enough in this sentence? I'm not sure.

Show haven't.

Show enough.

You know his voice, you know his humor, my good friend, compatriot, one man band leader, as I say on the show every time, let's say hello to our good friend Reggie Watts.

Hey guys, it's Reggie.

Hey guys.

Hey.

And, well, I mean, he just said hey, and you may recognize his voice from that, he just said hmm, and maybe that's another clue.

Our head writer on the show, also co-executive producer, and you've heard him on this show, this podcast, as, what are some of your characters?

Oh, Rick Faber.

Wait, who was the, who was the, was that the...

That was the teenage kid, Buford Dorsey, the politician.

Yes, Buford Dorsey, who wanted everything to come to him.

And Rick Faber was the one who felt bad about the way he treated adults.

Yeah, teenager feels bad about how immature teenagers are.

Look up his work, but Neil Campbell is here joining us as well.

Hi.

The trio.

Yeah.

Alright.

And guys, we're celebrating.

How do you feel knowing that in just a few days people are going to view what we've been working so hard on?

It's one of those abstract anticipations, waiting for the feedback to rush in through its various means.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Where do you get your feedback from?

I get a lot of feedback, mostly my microphone, but I do, you know, Tweetsies, Sweetsie Teetsies.

You check out a lot of tweets?

A lot of tweets and teets.

Really, you're checking out women's tits while you're tweeting?

Yeah, of course.

Oh, okay.

I look at pictures while I'm tweeting, I'm like, might as well look at something.

Look at something that's slang name kind of rhymes with the thing I'm looking at.

Sure.

Yeah.

So, yeah, just waiting to hear from friends and seeing how people react to it.

Friends, family.

Friends, family, people I don't know.

More importantly.

Hey, when you're at the Olive Garden, everyone's family.

I didn't know that.

Yeah.

So, you know, maybe you'll hear from them.

I hope so.

Neil, excited?

Very excited.

Very pumped, I guess you might say.

Like, I don't know, certain jams have been.

Or certain bodybuilders named Hans and Franz.

Definitely.

We have been working on it since October, you and I.

We started the writing before Reggie came in.

Reggie, you came in in February.

And just tirelessly working on this thing.

We want, basically our goal was to entertain America.

Is that safe to say?

Yeah.

I think it's something for everything.

Yes.

Not everyone, everything.

Everything.

You know, from bugs to potted plants.

Yep.

Anything is going to enjoy the show.

Canyons, cliff faces, rivers.

The Grand Canyon, most of all.

Magma.

Theories.

Theses.

Yeah.

So, Reggie, tell me about your favorite, the favorite thing you did this year.

Favorite thing I did this year.

I'm feeling like some of the surprises coming up at the show.

But what was your favorite memories?

I'll just give away the plot line.

Basically, no, I enjoyed some of the action sequences have been really fun to do.

And also just getting...

Have you done a lot of action sequences, by the way?

Not a lot.

Not since bang bang.

So that's really given me my first true action sequence.

I mean, I've imagined many an action sequence.

And simulated them.

But, you know, not like this.

And I also enjoy watching the guests on the show improvise.

And seeing some of the best improvisers in the world improv ising before my very eyes.

You crack up a lot on the show?

I does, yeah.

A little bit.

But I can.

Yeah.

That's true.

We can always cut away from you.

Yeah, or, you know, Paul Shaffer and all those weirdos.

They're always like, nah.

You're like, what are they laughing at?

I don't know.

They're just kind of crazy.

So I can get away with it.

Yeah.

What, who has made you laugh the hardest?

What do you think of anyone who you were just like, this is funny.

Well, PF to the Tompkins always.

PF Changs.

Oh, PF to the Tompkins.

Yeah, PF Tompkins.

Yeah, Tompkins.

He's, I don't know, he just, he always hits me in the right places.

And I just think he's such a brilliant person.

Mainly the ears.

Mainly the eyes.

Sometimes the eyes.

He's easy on the eyes, for sure.

Yeah.

He's easy to look at.

A lot of people you can't look at because of their vibr ational frequencies.

No, no.

You have to tune in, you have to wear special goggles, find the frequency, input it in there.

Of course.

But him, you look right at him, there he is.

There he is.

One of the few people like that.

Yeah.

I enjoyed him very much.

I thought Kendrick was.

Anna Kendrick.

That was a fun show.

That was crazy.

That'll be our third episode.

And yeah, that was a fun one for you and I, the Bahamama.

Oh, well, you don't want to say too much about it.

Oh yeah.

BM.

Yeah.

La BM.

If you ever wanted to see Anna Kendrick have a BM.

Yep.

Tune in third week.

There you go.

Yep.

BM's.

Maybe some cream drops.

Um, Neil, favorite memory go.

Oh, I mean, working with Scott and Reggie.

No.

Stop it.

Do you think we're taking it up a notch this year?

Yeah.

One notch.

That's all I wanted to take it up.

Do you think we achieved it?

I think it's better this year.

Yeah, I think it's way better.

Yeah.

The color correction alone is amazing.

Oh no, we took a lot of steps with that.

We wanted the reds to be really red.

Super red.

Lush.

Yeah, exactly.

Without getting into boring showbiz talk, I think a lot of shows.

Too late.

As they're, you know, they don't write an entire season, then shoot, then start to air.

So in the first season, it wasn't like we could start seeing the episodes and then kind of adjust.

So anything that we were able to learn from the first season, we were able to put into action this time.

Yeah.

But that's another, that's a good point though.

A lot of what most shows do is they work for about one or two months before they air, but they have to keep writing the entire time that they're shooting the show.

So in the middle of the show, sometimes you can see just it start to lag where they don't quite know where they're going.

And that's some of the problems with shows like Lost or Battlestar Galactica or something where just in the middle, they don't quite know what they 're doing and they're just trying to improvise as they make it up.

We got to write everything before we started shooting.

Yeah.

Not to say that there wasn't any improvisation and we didn 't write some new stuff, but...

Plus, it helps when there's no super strong narrative arc.

That's right.

You know?

Well, yeah.

That helps a lot because then the world is like, well, anything's possible.

I mean, there definitely are arcs in there, but it helps a lot.

We have that great Noah's Ark sketch.

We do have that Ark sketch, which comments on that fact of the show.

Yeah.

So, well, we're very pleased with ourselves.

We're amazing.

But Reggie, tell us what else is going on in your life.

I mean, you told me before the show, yeah, I want to talk about the TV show a little bit, but then I want to really get into what I'm up to.

So tell me exactly what's going on.

Well, you know, I'm...

You brought this vacuum in.

I brought a new Auric vacuum.

It's really light.

Cool.

And very effective.

Okay.

So that's one.

Two is, you know, I'm doing this Jash thing, which is just mainly just me making a bunch of weird, dumb videos.

We talked a lot about Jash at South by Southwest in one of our South by Southwest episodes.

Yeah.

And we talked about its offshoot Jish.

Yes, Jish.

Yeah, which is still being worked on because there's a lot of legal problems.

And you've made a lot of videos for Jash.

You made the Rick Astley one where you reenacted Rick Ast ley's Never Gonna Give You Up video.

Yep, finally.

Yeah, I finally did that.

And then, yeah, I have some other stuff that I'm working on .

It's just, it's mostly, a lot of it's just excuses to exercise production models, not really about a specific show idea.

It's more like I want to do a show to see if it's possible to use a certain type of camera technique or to, it's really kind of more around that.

Enough with the hard sell.

We'll watch these camera techniques that you're so interested in.

You guys are going to love the audio and camera techniques.

Like, I didn't like the idea, but man, camera work, whoa.

But what I'm trying to get at is your true hobbies.

Like, enough about show business, you know what I mean?

Model railroading, you know, if I want to get back into that, HO scale.

Although, N scale is more practical for New York.

Yeah, of course.

So, maybe N scale.

I have a model railroad, but I like to do it two size.

Oh, two size.

Yeah, I like to do it like actual size.

Oh, actual size, yeah, yeah, yeah, like scale.

Like, actual scale.

Yeah, exactly.

Well, good luck.

Thanks, yeah.

Are you allowed to have a private train and use like the nation's railways?

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Anyone can build their own train.

That's what people don't know.

It's a loophole.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Anyone can use those tracks.

You can have your own car, you can have your own plane.

Yep, that's right.

But trains, they're not just totally regulated by the government?

No, they're not exempt.

Anyone can use those tracks?

Anyone can have a train, that's the thing.

You have to call train traffic control ahead.

The other thing people don't know is you can build your own tracks.

That's true.

Anywhere you want.

That is true.

Yeah, so, I mean, why bother using their tracks when you might be stuck behind a slow Amtrak?

You know, the surf liner.

So slow.

Yeah, like get like a maglev line.

Yeah, exactly.

Just build your own track.

That would be cool.

I mean, the thing is like it is pretty cheap to build your own rail system and train.

Well, in this economy especially, I mean, you know.

More affordable.

Yeah, I mean, parts for trains are just like they're at an all-time low.

Super, yeah.

There's so many parts to a train, but like there's a few places that have all of them.

Yeah, yeah.

And we'll be right back.

Neil, tell me about your life.

What, Reggie's life was not captivating me.

Tell me about yours.

Oh, my mind's way more boring than anyone's really.

Go for it.

Out for us.

I mean, Reggie, you're globe trotting.

Yeah, I'm trotting a globe, yes.

Yeah, I mean, I travel a lot, yeah, for gigs.

But mostly I'm trying to chill out on traveling so much and focus on making cool videos.

Babies?

No, not babies.

Not making cool babies?

No, man.

Yeah, I could make some, I guess some cool.

I guess you just put sunglasses on them.

But I like the way you think.

Yeah, well, no, it's just.

So you're not going to try to raise them to have interests.

No.

That are aligned with yours.

You just want to put sunglasses on them.

No, I don't want them to be interesting people.

I just want them to be aesthetically cool.

Well, guys, we could talk all day, but why, oh, really, you want to do that?

Yeah.

Let's make this the shortest episode we've ever done.

Just 10 minutes and then we're out.

What do you say?

No way, man.

I'm going to say monologue in.

Okay, let's hear what you have to say.

Well, I'll just talk.

Great.

Yeah.

Do a, what do you call those when you're in the middle of the Senate and you.

filibuster.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Peeing in a jar.

Oh, yeah.

Let's do that.

Okay.

All right.

No, go ahead.

Monologue for us.

Zip.

Is that the sound your pee makes?

Zip?

As it comes out of your peel?

That's the sound my button fly makes.

What?

Yeah.

Your butt and fly?

The fly that lives in my butt.

Oh, the butt fly.

Well, was that good?

You didn't cut out that whole monologue, did you?

Oh, yeah.

I cut it out.

It was too boring.

Cut it out in post.

Oh, well.

My throat's tired.

That was like 12 minutes.

Yeah.

Now, stop talking.

I'm going to make your throat really tired.

Do you know what I mean?

What?

Oh, thank you.

I assume he's buying me a delicious meal, Reggie.

I guess so.

Or some tiring gel, throat tiring gel.

Reggie, do you have anything for us that you could play for us here to take us into our first break?

What do you think?

Yeah, I got an exclusive track.

You've been working on this for a long time, I know.

I've been working on this.

This is an exclusive track from Diplo and his friends, his friend Duplo and Diplo and Daito.

So see if you guys recognize some of this stuff as an exclusive track.

Hey, all right.

Turning it up.

OK, here we go.

OK, small village, eastern Croatia.

OK, here we go.

When there's a sound of a bird up above and there's a sound of a bird down below you are the middle bird of the bunch beware of what's under you you are a bird, bird, bird you are a bird, bird, bird Everybody likes the sound of pitter-patter little feets across the tin roof in Croatia where you used to eat your meats but then you moved to Australia to the outback corrugated roofs are all the rage there they're little rusty watch out for the spiders that'll come out of hiding bite you on your feet and cause you to almost die until you get airlifted to the hospital that has the antivenom then you will survive and understand that you are better right where you would live where you would live Oh, that is so beautiful.

I can tell why that took you so long to write.

Well, I mean, Diplo is hard to get in contact with.

Yeah, yeah. He just wrote the lyrics to that, right?

He just wrote, just wrote the lyrics.

Yeah, every other word too.

Every other word I wrote the hook.

Yeah, and then the other words, how did those come about?

Those came about just through, um, you remember like in The Matrix when they had all the camera rays, you know, and then show like someone rotating, but there was always a gap in between each camera.

They had to create this interpolation software to kind of round it out.

That's what they did with this.

It's like a lyrical program.

It's kind of like morphing.

Yeah.

Yeah, okay.

I've actually noticed about a lot of song lyrics, a lot of times they have words that I've heard in other places.

Yes.

But they're mixed up in a different way.

Yeah, in a different order and with a different like rhythm to them, but it's rarely, I mean, maybe with the exception of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, rarely.

Yes, always.

Yeah, yeah.

Really words that I haven't heard before.

I'm glad you brought that up because I've gotten into so many arguments about that with the Chili Peppers.

Well, the Chili Peppers, mainly the words they use, like Shamalama Ding Dong and Dangle Dangle, California Dangle, you know, yeah.

And Gibb It Away.

Gibb It Away.

Yeah, Gibb It Away, Gibb It Away, Gibb It Away.

Yeah, like they come up with such great new words that that's why they're true innovators.

Yeah, absolutely.

It's more about that.

But like, you know, and no knock on you, Reggie, but all the songs you've created and sang in your history are all words that have been used in several other, not just songs, but in other places.

And I've admitted that in interviews ranging, dating back maybe even two years ago.

Really?

Okay.

Yeah, so that's not, I mean, I'm not, I'm going to totally admit to that.

Okay.

It is kind of hypocritical though.

There's some bands that like will never sell out.

We're going to, you know, but I've heard Fugazi songs that use words that I've heard in countless other commercials.

Multiple commercials, you know?

Yeah.

Like their song Waiting Room?

Yep.

Guys, Try Harder.

Yes.

You know?

Yes.

So, can you do a song with no words that have ever been used before?

Of course.

I mean, yeah, using software I could.

Okay.

Do you have that software here with you today?

Let me guess, digital software?

No.

Wait, would you have a problem with digital software?

Yeah, I got a problem with digital software.

You prefer analog software?

Yeah.

Okay.

I can use analog software.

It's not that, everybody loves Anna anyways.

Yeah.

Let's see, let's hear a song with the, It's a little, it's a little one.

It's a really little one.

Okay.

We hope you dig it.

Make sure there's nothing like give it away.

I'm not going to use give it away.

Or Californication.

Or California.

Red hooded sweatshirt.

Yeah.

California, fornification.

Okay.

Here we go.

I'll do a beat.

Let's see.

Okay.

Here we go.

Those don't count.

Okay.

Here we go.

It still doesn't count.

Okay.

All right.

Here we go.

That still doesn't count.

Okay.

Here it comes.

Okay.

All right, guys, we have to take a break.

We will be right back with more Reggie, more Neil after this.

We'll be right back with more Reggie, more Neil after this.

Okay, good. And Neil, my sidekick.

Hi, Daddy.

And my son.

Hi, Papa.

I adopted you during the course of the show.

I wanted to be like Liberace and Matt Damon.

And I don't mean the character Matt Damon played on that movie.

I mean Liberace actually adopted Matt Damon.

I know, I know.

It's a famous Hollywood story.

That's why he wanted to be in that movie behind the candel abra.

Because he was just portraying the man that always hung around the house.

Yeah.

So cool for Damon.

So cool.

So cool, guys.

I heard he and Ben Affleck were down to their last chicken sandwich when they sold the screenplay for Good Will Hunting.

Really?

That's what I heard.

Were they splitting it?

I guess, yeah.

You just have a pre-made sandwich sitting in your fridge like most people.

And Damon was so good at math, you figure, you know.

But what I don't want to know is, okay, yeah, you sell the script, but it takes you at least like six months to get paid by these corporations.

What did they eat until then?

That's how we got so skinny for Courage Under Fire.

Ohhhhh.

Great Hollywood story.

Hollywood tales.

Hollywood nights.

Duck tale.

Duck nights.

Duck night begins.

Darkwing Duck begins.

When you're in trouble, call DW.

Thirty.

Girl in trouble is a temporary thing.

Oh my god, that's so funny you say that.

I've been listening to that for the last three days.

Really?

Yeah, Romeo Void.

I have no idea.

Girl in trouble is a temporary thing.

Try to sue us, Romeo Void.

We don't give a fuck.

Wouldn't it be better if we just slept together?

Yes, Daniel, you were saying?

Oh, well, you just said, I didn't know who that song was.

Yeah, but yeah, but really?

Here, let me play it for you.

And a girl in trouble is a temporary thing.

Temporary, temporary, temporary, temporary.

Girl in trouble is a temporary thing.

Damn, I'm going to go to Amoeba and get that MP3 after this .

Uh oh, Amoeba time.

Have they started selling MP3s?

Just selling air?

I guess they're on, yeah.

Just space?

Yeah, space on your hard drive.

Well guys, we all know what time it is in the show.

I do.

Oh yeah, tell us.

It is time to get down and feel good.

That is right, because it's time for the Freestyle Rap Battle.

Oh my gosh.

Who do you think will win?

I wonder.

We have two terrible white rappers.

When I say terrible white rappers, we're not white rappers.

We're terrible at both rapping and being white.

Yeah.

And you have Reggie Watts, who does this for a living.

I'm, yeah, kind of.

Cody, we need, Engineer Cody's here with us, we need a subject.

God damn, one word. All you need to think of is one word, and he gave me a look of fear, and then he shrugged.

Come on, one word out of anything.

Vacuum cleaners.

All right, Neil. Take it.

Oh no.

Here we go, vacuum cleaners.

Neil Campbell, Neil Campbell, Neil Campbell.

When I'm sucking up dirt in my room, I have a vacuum cleaner and not a broom.

I need to get clean because my girl's coming over.

I don't want her to see all the shit on the floor.

All the things that will make her realize girls aren't my thing.

I gotta get down, I gotta get rid of stuff and get out of town.

When I'm cleaning with my vacuum, I got a girl coming over.

She don't know I'm gay.

I just play it that way.

She will never know I ain't straight.

I was here last night with my mate, and we did mate.

Suck it up.

Yeah! Suck it up!

Suck it up like a vacuum cleaner. Suck it up like a cleaner .

Well, I was sitting in my room watching Darkwing Duck, then I grabbed the vacuum cleaner.

What did I do? Suck! Suck, suck, suck, suck, suckin' up the dirt.

Suckin' up the dirt don't hurt.

Because, whoa, why did this music get so loud?

Music got loud from the cloud, yeah.

I store my music in the cloud because I don't like to have CDs.

Nuts!

I like data.

I like data because I'm a player who likes the data.

I keep all my songs in my cloud, playa.

I suck up the cloud. What if you could use a vacuum on songs?

Boy, that would be really cool.

You'd have a ton of songs in your vacuum cleaner, and then you'd empty the bag, and throw out all your songs.

Empty the bag. Throw out all the songs.

Reggie Watts!

Yo, I'm the kind of guy who likes to keep clean, but no one ever knows because I try to not be seen.

I always got my vacuum cleaner on the clean clean.

Everyone sees me pull it out of my trunk.

I take it out of trunks and I bring it in the houses.

Vacuum all the crumbs and all the little mouses.

I do it just for free because I love to vacuum.

Everybody knows I like to come with vacuum.

Thank you very much, Mr. Mr. Vacuum.

I think I'm going to try an Auric today, or maybe I'll try a Dyson today, or maybe I'll try another off-brand thing.

But I got to know, dirt devil's up in my bitch, because I never knew this thing is what you're flipping my flitch.

And you feel my time, family, if you're flipping my glitch, you got to do it everything because the vacuum is right.

Yo, yo, yo, you've got a handle and a stem, and it's got this thing that has a rotating brush that keeps lots of things out of its way, but it specifically grabs an engineer to get everything on your floor, except for the things that you hold dear, like gold rings and necklaces and earrings.

They definitely won't suck that stuff up, because it's got an intelligent system that can kind of filter out the types of things that you prefer, and it's preferenced through an application you download to your phone.

And that's how vacuums work, how they always worked all the way from the 50s.

Applications ruled the content of the vacuum cleaners, and people knew that shit.

Yo, witch hazel, whatever, you got to use that shit as you can.

Bewitched is not enough, so you got to stick to the plan, because the sams, the two sams, I couldn't tell the difference, but all I knew is one thing that kept them both together.

It was the flume, the plume, the gloom.

Yo, it was at my fucking vacuum.

YEAH!

Let's hear it for Neil again!

All right, here we go.

I use my back-gume to suck up coins.

I use my mouth to suck up groins.

And I'm in, if I get rid of the dirt, you know I get rid of my shirt.

And then I'm getting real dirty, and I speak cause I'm getting real flirty, with all the boys at the pool.

I go there every day after school.

I'm not in school, I'm 33, but I like the boys who watch younger than me.

So after they get out of school, I head on down into the pool, and I see them with just their trunks on, and I say, damn, that's one long schlong.

I want in the locker room so you can do the nasty boom up my butt and in my face.

I will do it, no disgrace.

I like the way you sweat, and I like feeling your wet little mouth on mine.

So much younger, but you look so fine.

Banana when I take you home, and your mom doesn't know where you are.

No, no, she was trying to pick you up, but you're at my house, and I'm making you up, up, up, up it goes.

You make it, learn to grow, then I teach you how to do the same to your own body.

Ooh, that's my name.

You're going to keep saying my name.

My name is Nila, dude, that's my name.

Say it real loud, don't be ashamed.

That's amazing.

That's really amazing.

Oh, no, no, no, we're done, we're done.

You don't have to start it over.

That was the best.

Who's the winner?

That was the best.

I can't tell.

I think Neelathan for sure.

Neel rhymed a lot, I have to say.

He did, he rhymed the most.

I'm going to award this to Neel, congratulations.

Yeah, it's got to go.

Wow, I'm going to kill myself now.

Although I think the idea of a vacuum sucking up songs is interesting.

Man, it's pretty interesting.

You know, and gave us a lot to think about.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You know, we're going to chew on that for a good long while .

It's just good to hear stuff from male lesbians is all I'm saying.

Yeah.

Neel, how much of that was true?

True to life?

I haven't been to a pool in years.

So then all the rest of that stuff that came with it.

None of it was really.

You're just guessing?

I was picturing my place where I live when I was rapping about my room, I guess.

And what pool were you picturing when you were picturing a pool?

I guess Fairfax Villas pool in Fairfax, Virginia.

Shout out to Fairfax Villas.

VA.

Yeah, yeah.

So that's a kind of a.

Hey, I saw John Riggins there once.

Sure.

Oh wow, John Riggins from Friday Night Lights?

From the Washed Dead Redskins.

Oh right, right, right.

Sorry.

Reggie, do you have something to take us to commercial?

And we should mention you do this every commercial with us on the TV show.

I do.

So one of the great joys of working on the show is hearing your songs every day.

Oh, thanks.

And it makes the crew, it makes the time go quicker and they enjoy working on the show, I think, more.

We had a dance party one of our last days.

Yeah, we had a nice little impromptu dance party.

Yeah, so.

Which is hard for crews to do sometimes.

It is because they're so self-conscious.

They're so self-conscious and so waiting for the next shot.

That's the thing.

They're always just like, when is that next shot?

When is that?

So they feel like they can't dance.

That's true.

So you're just going to improvise a song here using your talent.

Yeah, I'm going to use some Tealint.

Okay.

And here we go.

All right.

This one goes out to Kate Berlant, who's currently somewhere doing something.

Okay, let's do it.

Okay.

Oh, is it over?

Sorry guys.

Implied infinity.

Fantastic Reggie, we'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang after this.

Comedy Bang Bang, we're getting low.

We're here with Rajee Watts.

Rajee Watts.

This is very good to be here.

We're also here with Rajee Campbell.

Hi.

And we want to say Comedy Bang Bang comes out this Friday, 10 p.m.

This is a special bonus show just to let you guys know.

It's coming out this Friday, 10 p.m. IFC.

And then you can get them on iTunes after that.

iTunes or Amazon or whatever you want.

What about Netflix?

Netflix, if you want to check out the first season, check out the first season on Netflix.

Yeah.

You know, and they'll be on Netflix at some point after we stop airing.

But this Friday, Andy Samberg is our special guest on the couch.

You.

A lot of cool surprises.

Hopefully by now you've already seen the Sarah Silverman episode, which has been online for free.

And hopefully you'll- It's stacked.

The premiere is stacked.

Yeah, we decided to stack this one.

Oh yeah.

It's triple.

So guys, we all know, and I have to clear my throat because of that rap.

Boy, I just, the very notion of- Did you get a bad rap?

A vacuum that sucks up songs?

It's pretty amazing.

Are you patenting it?

Yeah.

But it's time to play a little game.

Are we ready, Cody?

Yeah.

Called Would You Rather.

You can start those songs off strong.

You don't have to fade them up every time in the middle of them.

He's a smooth guy.

I didn't see him in the talk, are you?

Doom.

I'm going to play a mega round of Would You Rather.

Are you ready?

Mega.

How does that differ from a standard?

I don't know.

We might do two questions.

Gotcha.

Holy fuck.

All right, guys.

We all know how this is played.

I will say, people send us Would You Rather scenarios.

It's been so long since I've said this, people, that I forgot how it goes.

People send me Would You Rather scenarios to our Twitter, which is at CBBWYR.

Please don't send them to me personally.

I will read them out loud.

I will then open the floor for questions.

You can ask me any question you like about either of the scenarios in order to narrow down your choice.

Okay.

Then we will close the floor for questions.

You'll vote.

We'll tally up the points, and we'll see who wins.

All right.

We may do more than one question, depending on how long we take.

All right.

Here we go.

This comes to us from Tawny Clark, aka ColorMeTawny.

Hmm.

She, I'm assuming it's a she because of the name.

I can't contain myself.

Okay.

Asks, Would you rather be in a buddy cop comedy with Donald Trump forever or have to let a family of spiders live in your ear?

And there is no time period she lists, so it's not forever, I would guess.

You can ask the question about that, I'm sure.

Family of my family.

Would you rather be in a buddy cop comedy with Donald Trump forever or have to let a family of spiders live in your ear ?

I'm opening the floor for questions.

Are there breaks?

In which scenario?

In the buddy cop one?

There's commercial breaks, yeah.

But like are you filming constantly or are you just like normal?

You're not filming.

This is not being filmed.

It's just your life.

You're in that reality.

Yeah, you're in reality.

Basically the reality is you're a police officer.

Probably your partner is Donald Trump.

Yeah.

Right? Okay.

And he's the real Donald Trump.

He just moonlights as a police officer.

I know what I would go for.

Okay.

God, this is not a play of the game.

What?

Every time you tinkle, they take a commercial break.

Okay.

Good to know.

Okay.

Neil.

What sort of- By the way, I have not opened the floor for questions.

Oh, shit.

So Reggie, I'm going to have to dock you points.

Oh, damn it.

So sorry.

I was starting to ask.

No, but you didn't, so.

Okay, I've opened the floor.

Neil, you have a question?

Yeah.

What type of comedy is it?

Like what's the rating on the comedy?

I don't see the word comedy anywhere in this scenario.

I thought it said buddy cop comedy.

Yeah, it does.

Yeah, you wanted it.

You're right.

I'm docking myself points.

What kind of comedy is it?

Yeah, I mean like is it rated R?

Is it like a family comedy, buddy cop?

You know, there's kindergarten cops and there's- 400- Lethal weapons.

Yeah.

Lethal weapon or- it's somewhere in between.

Okay.

It's a bad boys kind of thing.

Oh, lethal weapons.

Yeah.

That might've been rated R.

Well, okay.

Okay.

But that's good.

That's good.

Okay.

Yeah.

Both are bad boys.

Mm.

And who's badder do you think, I wonder, between you and Donald Trump, Neil?

I'm trying to think.

Well, he's probably done immeasurable evil.

Against society.

I'm just kind of annoying.

Sort of boring sometimes.

It's probably Washington.

All right, Reggie, question?

How large are the spiders?

That's a great question.

That is a great question.

They're really super tiny.

Oh, okay.

But they have- they trot a heavy path.

They trot a heavy path?

Yeah.

Like in life?

Meaning they're really super tiny, but they feel heavy.

They feel heavy.

So your head kind of is at a tilt all the time?

Yeah, always at a tilt, yeah.

If you were a pinball machine, it would say, tilt.

Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

So I'm going to help you determine the time span here.

Mm-hmm.

I assume family spiders have finite life spans, so they would die unless they can keep committing incest, and the bloodline continues.

Well, they're- Are they doing that, or- Yeah, they're incestuous spiders, yeah, which is pretty disgusting.

So it's a regular Craster's Keep inside your ear?

Apparently.

Ugh.

So yeah, they just keep re-breeding, and they keep having more and more baby spiders and more and more of them.

Does it tickle?

Um, it depends.

I mean, you know, I mean, do you find that the weight of millions and millions of spiders crawling around in your ear would tickle you, or would that just cause you intense pain?

Seems more like pain.

Is there, like, in most, I would say, buddy cop things, both of the cops usually have like romantic interests?

Entanglements?

Yeah, and is there like a- I like where this is going.

Yeah, so do I.

Sort of like a good looking romantic interest for you?

For Donald?

For both or for you?

Oh, no, for Donald, yeah, definitely.

Only for Donald?

Yeah.

That one's just a single, lonely person?

Ivanka Trump dates Donald in this.

Shinky.

So wait, so you like this?

Okay.

It's a regular Crestor's Keep over there.

Oh, well, I still don't know what that means.

Guys, look it up at Wikipedia.

Reggie, question?

Yeah, is Donald Trump the same age that he is now, or is he a different age than he was?

He is exactly the same age as he is when you make this decision, so don't take too long.

Okay, gotcha.

Otherwise you'll have old Trump.

Ugh.

Yeah.

Wow, it's a new...

Would you say that both situations are a regular Crestor's Keep?

I personally?

Yeah.

Knowing exactly what that reference is?

Mm-hmm.

Of course I would.

If you dive into the ocean, would the spiders die?

Yeah, that's why you don't do it, because you think they're so cool that you would hate to kill them.

Oh.

Is your brain ever under attack from bugs that it's good to have spiders in there?

That's the thing.

In this scenario, you live on a bug planet, and bugs are constantly attacking your ears, and on bug planet, that's how they worm their way into your mind and wrestle control of your mind away.

So, the spiders being there is a good thing.

Kind of a shield.

Yes.

Strategic homeland.

Like Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Yes.

Something, something.

How, you have to, this is random.

The floor's closed!

Oh, God, you didn't get it in under the wire.

Just about to ask a really important question.

Oh, man, I'm so sorry, Neil.

Ugh, reminds me of where I sleep.

Under, I have my DVD shelf is above my bed.

Oh, okay, great.

Um, here we go.

Let's tally, oh no, we can't tally the points.

You guys haven't voted yet.

This time, I'm going to Neil Campbell first.

How do you like to vote?

Advantage Neil.

I'm going to go, uh, uh, buddy cop.

I think it'd be fun to have a job.

It'd be fun to have a job.

Yeah.

Okay, great.

Great answer.

Reggie, how do you like to vote?

Since I'm a big fan of The Witches of Eastwick, I'm going to go with the spiders.

Okay, and I don't see how that relates.

It's just like, I always, whenever I think of that title, I think of, it's kind of spidery.

So, you think The Witches of Eastwick, Wick, reminds you of spiders.

Yeah.

And being a big fan of that book and or movie.

Because there's the Spiderwick Chronicles.

Yeah, that's right.

That's what we're thinking.

Yeah.

We got Wick.

And big Spiderbeck.

So.

Yeah.

Okay.

Those things.

So, it kind of makes sense.

Yeah.

So, you're going to choose to live on a bug planet where you're constantly attacked by bugs.

But protected by a family of spiders.

Protected by a family of spiders in one ear.

In one ear.

But within three days, the bugs figure out you don't have spiders in the other ear, and they go in there and they take control of your mind, and you become a zombie on bug planets.

You would rather do that.

Well, I mean, at least I'd live three days longer than most people.

That's true.

Most people who what?

Die at birth.

That die of birth.

Of birth, yeah.

Or birds.

Did you hear she died of birth?

Yeah.

I actually, my cousin died of old age at birth.

What?

That is crazy.

Yeah, yeah, it's weird.

Are they okay?

No.

That's so weird.

Yeah, she's fine.

She's fine.

She's fine now.

Oh, wow, okay.

Interesting.

That's so cool.

Okay, so Neil, you voted for...

Buddy Cop.

You live forever.

And Reggie, you voted for a bug planet where you live three days longer than most people who die of birth.

Yeah.

Right.

But it's inspired by the Witches of Eastwood.

Interesting.

All right, let's tally up the points.

So, Reggie, you voted correctly.

Oh, awesome.

So, you get the point.

You get one point.

Yeah.

But, Reggie, you asked a question before the floor was open and you got docked 565,383 points.

So, at negative 565,382, Neil, you're our winner with one point.

Yay.

Cheese.

And that is how we play Would You Rather.

I've heard of the climactic conclusion, but anticlimactic?

He waited a beat.

All right, guys, it's time for the very last feature on the show.

It's time for a little something we call Plugs.

The only thing left to do is, of course, a little something that we call Plugs.

Plugs.

Ooh, nice and short.

Thank you so much.

That was Plugs by Park.

Nice and short.

Titled it correctly.

Title is exactly what it was, is Plugs.

Thanks, Park.

And if you want to give us a Plugs theme, if you want to make one and hear it played on the show, go to earwolf.com and put it in the comedy bang-bang threads under the earwolf message boards.

I'm not saying this correctly.

I feel like I haven't said any of these words in so long.

We've been working on the show.

And you can be famous for a week, and Park, you are famous for at least a couple of days.

So the Plug Bag is open.

What are we plugging?

First of all, we have to plug the Comedy Bang-Bang TV show this Friday, IFC, 10 p.m.

Andy Sam, we've talked about it a lot, but we're...

That's why we're here in this room together.

We're pretty proud of this episode and of this season, I would say.

I would say definitely.

We like ourselves.

I'm more proud of this than anything else in my life.

Wow, is that true?

Yeah.

Huh.

This season of the show.

Really?

I think it's the crowning achievement of my life thus far.

Of your life?

Yeah.

So if you were to die, God forbid.

I'll probably die soon.

You think you'll die soon?

Yeah.

Within the next 80 years.

Yeah.

Or buy a Dyson vacuum cleaner.

One of the two.

Of course, yeah.

Oh, we should get that wrap going again so we can talk about this.

So we definitely want to plug that.

Catch it this Friday.

It'll probably be repeated as well throughout the week, but this Friday is the important one because the initial ratings...

You know, watch it live is what I would say.

Don't even watch it within three days on your DVR.

And if you go over to a friend's house to watch it, just keep your TV on, IFC.

Yes, especially if you're a Nielsen family.

God, why are you going over to friend's houses to watch things if you're a Nielsen family?

And if you are a Nielsen family, send us your address and we will send you money.

Yes.

And not just any money.

Like legal tender.

Funny money.

Funny money, yeah.

Funny money.

Yeah.

What if all money were free, guys?

I mean...

There'd be no economy.

But it was worth exactly what it was worth.

That'd be amazing.

You know what I mean?

Like, if anyone asked for it, you'd have to give it to them because it's free, but you could also pay for stuff with it.

That's great.

That would be amazing.

All right, so we want to plug that this Friday, make sure to watch it.

Reggie, what else do you have to plug?

I've got...

Well, Comedy Bang Bang's coming out, so you guys should check that out.

What's that on?

Season two.

It's on IFC.

Whoa.

Yeah, so I have that, and I'll be doing some things here and there online and doing some festivals.

Jish.com.

I'm doing Jish.com, Jash.com.

I'm doing Meltdown Festival in London, doing Solid Sound Festival.

I'm doing Bombershoot, which you'll be at.

Well, we already did it at this point.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm going to do it the year next year , too.

Next year, too?

I decided because we had such a great time.

Nice.

So definitely doing next year's Bombershoot, and I would have done some of the things.

Oh, no, no, Bombershoot we won't have done.

We've done Bonnaroo at this point.

Oh, okay.

Bombershoot, are we doing Bombershoot together?

I think we are.

Yeah, yeah, I never got a confirmation on it, but that would be great.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So we're all doing Bombershoot.

It's going to be fun.

And there's a lot of festivals.

TEDx Berlin.

Yeah.

That'll be fun.

Definitely.

Yeah, it'll be good.

I'm doing Coachella.

I'm headlining Coachella.

Coachee.

Yeah.

It's a pretty sweet deal.

It's pretty, yeah.

You know what I mean?

They were like, hey, we have this big stage.

No one wants to be here.

Yep.

No one wants, everyone's afraid.

Of the stage.

Of headlining.

I was like, I'll do it.

So cool.

Interesting.

Yeah, it's pretty badass.

You're just going to talk about stuff.

Mmm, I'm going to play a Radiohead album.

Oh, okay.

That's great.

Front to back?

Yeah, front to, yeah, no, back to front, actually.

Oh, back to front.

I'm, yeah, yeah, I'm going to play, yeah, in reverse order.

Okay.

Yeah.

Easy.

Creep.

Yeah.

Weirdo.

Hey.

What the hell are you doing there?

I am one.

You don't belong here.

Neil, what do you have?

I.

Whoa.

Oh, jeez.

Calm up.

You were, yeah.

Sorry.

Gilly.

I am very proud of Comedy Bang Bang season two.

Oh.

IFC, Friday 10 p.m.

I'm going to watch probably somewhere else, but I'll have my TV on in my apartment.

Would you say you're going to watch the shit out of it?

Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

I think someone in my family has to.

So I'm going to watch that.

I do an improv show every Thursday at 11 p.m. at the UCB Theater in L.A. called Last Days True.

Did that affect your work on Fridays, by the way?

No.

Do you think on Fridays that you'd been out so late the night before that you were not very good on the show?

I would say I actually typically didn't get to bed before midnight.

Every day, really?

So you were kind of sluggish every day is what you're speaking of.

I don't know.

I just sleep about that little.

Really?

What's going on with your sleep?

Actually, literally yesterday, it was the first day of a long time, I was like, hey, don't have to set my alarm at all.

Here we go.

This is going to be great.

Yep.

Slept six hours.

So you like to sleep six hours.

That's about what I guess.

So you go from midnight to six.

Yeah.

And then you're up and you're fresh.

Do you nap at all?

I don't nap.

You don't nap.

Is there something wrong with you?

Maybe, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, okay.

I hit a zone where that's all I need and then it'll kill me .

And so last day of school on Thursdays at 11 at the UCB Los Angeles.

We were LA Weekly best of LA.

Timeout LA pick of the week.

Enough brags.

Come on.

This is a plug bag, not a brag bag.

Nearly 9 million Facebook likes.

I know.

Okay.

This is the interesting thing about Neil's improv group.

They call themselves last day of school.

Yeah.

All right.

They have a Facebook page called last day of school and all the kids who are in school across the country or maybe the world think that it's a Facebook page for the concept of the last day of school.

So they click like on it.

And so how many likes on Facebook does your improv group have?

I will literally check right this second to tell you the update.

We have right now updating things circling 8,716,992 likes.

8 million likes for your improv group.

And at some point they figure out it's an improv group.

They don't care.

There's a list that is constantly updated of the most popular Facebook pages.

Last time I checked, we were 332 of the most popular Facebook pages.

And it says next to it what our category is, which is comedian.

So we were like right above Carrie Underwood last time I checked.

And weren't you saying that you'll post info about shows and people will write on it, hey, I think this is some gay improv group.

Yeah, look at these assholes.

Anytime we post anything, it's like hundreds of comments and stuff.

But it's also good if we're going to post a video or something.

Yeah, you have one of the most popular sites on the internet.

And do you?

It's just for a live show.

We don't even make videos together.

We've all agreed individually, oh, if you make something, put it here.

If you're something you want to promote, it's a pretty good way to reach a bunch of Facebook pages.

And has it translated into popularity at all for your work?

Our shows sell out every week, but they were doing that before Facebook anyway.

Can you tell them about Comedy Bang Bang coming out this Friday?

I will, I will, yeah.

All right, please.

Well, I don't have 8 million Facebook likers.

I have quite a few less, but I do want to tell everyone about Comedy Bang Bang this Friday.

We had a great time doing it this year and I'm really proud of the shows.

And also I want to plug July 17, that's coming up, July 17, I'll be at the House of Blues in San Diego.

House of Blues for a Comic-Con show.

So and special guests, the Blues Brothers are going to be there.

Blues Brothers 2000 are going to be joining me.

So come on out.

That's Wednesday, July 17, I believe at 730 or 8, I think.

And it's special Comic-Con show, Comedy Bang Bang show, come on out and Blues Brothers will be there.

We have John Goodman, we have Jim Belushi, we have Dan Ayk royd.

We have also Jake and Elwood Blues are there.

And the little, we have Joe Morton is there and the kid Blues Brother is there.

So the whole Blues Brother family is there.

None of the wives, because when the boys are out, when the cat's away, the Blues Brothers will bow, bow, bow, bow.

Why do they wait for the cat to leave?

They're so sensitive to that cat.

Well, that's the thing is the Blues Brothers are respectful of the cats.

You know what I mean?

So come on out to see that.

And but more importantly, watch the TV show and hope you like it.

Would love to hear what you think of it.

Tweet me.

Hey, Reggie, this guy's cool.

It really is.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

What do you say?

Closing up the plug bag.

Bing-dong, bing-dong, bing-dong, bing-dong, bing-dong, bing -dong.

And that is it.

That has been a very special lackadaisical show.

And hope you enjoyed it and watch the TV show.

We'll also be back on the podcast on Monday.

And Reggie, do you have something to take us out with?

Yeah.

Take you out tonight.

Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

Yeah.

All right.

Here we go.
