From chronic to collapse, town and into now respectively that is, this is R.U. talking REM-ME.

The comprehensive and encyclopedic compendium of all things REM, this is good.

Rock and roll.

Music.

Welcome back to our first episode.

Welcome back.

Welcome.

Finally.

Back.

Welcome.

For the first time.

Back.

You're listening to R.U. talking REM-ME.

Question mark.

R.E. with a colon, meaning referring to, what does R.E.

with a colon mean?

And I have several questions about your colon, by the way, after that.

Yeah.

R.E.

What's going on with that?

It means a guy named R.E.

R.E. and- Oh wait, R.E. from Onjuraj?

Yes.

Oh yeah.

R.E.

Wait, I'm sorry.

Is this an episode of R.E.'s colon?

Music.

Yeah.

Hey, buddy.

Welcome to R.E.s.

colon.

This is Scott.

We don't have a lot to say about R.E.s colon today.

It's not looking great.

Listen, what can you say that hasn't already been said about R.E.

R.E.

is calling.

Yeah.

Not one of our best.

It was fine.

They got off on the wrong foot, I think, when I mispronounce everybody.

Yeah, you stupid, stupid man.

Welcome to the show.

This is our first episode, although it certainly is a continuation of a podcast that my co-host and I used to record together, I guess, as a fair assessment of what we used to do?

Sure.

I honestly didn't know we were going to, or you were going to bring that up.

Wait, you didn't know we were recording it when we first started?

I think it's well known.

I was wearing a wire that you were tricking me into recording a podcast.

We had firmly established that we were pretending privately to record a podcast.

The whole time, it's interesting, if you listen to the first episode of the show, you talk in YouTube to me, I'm constantly saying, Adam, could you speak into my flower that's on my lapel?

Yes, it was a giant daisy.

It was beautiful.

The gorgeous.

Beautiful flower, maybe, of all time.

No, the most gorgeous daffodil, sorry, daisy, daisy, I've ever seen.

Do you?

Scott, just shut up for a second.

I have seen a lot of daisies.

Really?

Yeah, where have you seen your daisies mainly?

Well, I went to the daisy festival, of course.

The daisy, daisy chains.

Daisy chains festival of lights.

Beautiful, beautiful festival.

I don't miss it.

Beautiful.

It's a festival of lights, not daisies.

Well, but if you see a daisy there, then you're in luck because you win a million dollars.

And that's how you got your start.

Yep.

I got a million dollars for spotting the daisy at the festival of lights.

And that really helped you through the lean years when no one wanted to hire an Adam quadrero.

Right.

No one wanted to.

And so I would say if I had a lean week, say, with no work, I would say.

Sure.

Well, those weeks now, I mean, they're few and far between.

A lean snap.

Oh, the weeks are so big.

Big fucking weeks.

Pepper weeks.

But back then, if I was on the lean week, I could eat a hundred thousand dollars.

Sure.

And my belly was full for a whole day.

Full of paper.

Yes.

One full day.

Full of cloth.

Because as you know, currency, American currency, is made technically of cloths.

Certainly.

According to my calculations.

Meanwhile, if I was ever having a lean week, I would have to eat moths out of my wallet.

Boy.

Oh, Scott Ockermann moth wallet.

Hey, that's, you know what, that is a great segue into what I wanted to talk about, which was our names.

Yes.

You named me.

This is Scott, by the way.

Oh, sorry.

Sorry, everybody.

This is Scott.

By the way, is there anyone you want to say hello to out there or?

Um, well, I would like to say hello to my friends.

Hmm.

I would like to say hello to my family.

Okay.

I would like to say hello to my fans.

Mm hmm.

And I would like to say hello to you.

Scott, hello.

Hello.

Thank you so much for including me.

You're welcome.

A lot of times, I feel a little left out when you're saying hello to people.

I don't think I've ever left you on, but I'd have to check my records.

Oh, where are your records kept?

They're right here.

Would you like me to check?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, well, oh my gosh, you brought the entire filing cabinet for.

Okay.

Let me open the cabinet.

All right.

We're.

Gotta flip through these files.

Oh, here it is.

Pull out a paper.

Oh, wait.

I have to get out my decoder range.

It's written in invisible.

Mm hmm.

Yep.

I said hello to you every single time.

Oh, my mistake.

Wait, let me close.

Sorry, I have to close up.

Got to close everything?

Okay.

Mm hmm.

And I'm going to put it in my backpack.

Okay.

All right.

Great.

All right.

Got to show.

Let's do my mistake.

I apologize for that.

I had no idea you said that.

You know what?

Let's just forget it happened.

You seem mad though.

Well, you accused me of not only lying to you, but betraying our friendship.

Not really, not really an accusation of either of those merely an accusation that you have never said hello to me ever in our relationship and you're currently lying about it and those files are fake.

That is a lie, first of all, that I have never said hello to you.

I have said hello to you at least seven or eight times.

Seven or eight times over years.

Years.

I said at least at most, let's say two million, two million times.

Somewhere in there.

That's a big range.

It's too big.

It would be too big if you were playing Price's right and Bob Barker coming up the driveway.

Yeah.

And Bob Barker's coming up the driveway.

Here he comes.

And he says, okay, you got to pick a price in between seven or eight.

Yep.

And two million.

Two million.

I'd say, Hey, Bob, give me nine.

You know, it doesn't matter or one million, nine hundred thousand, ninety nine.

You know, you bottles of beer on the wall.

Nine, nine, I'm out of the beer.

You take one down, pass it around.

I didn't have bottles of beer on the way.

Adam Scott over here.

For those of you who may be new to listening to us, welcome.

You're in for a wonderful, wonderful time.

Scott, please.

Okay.

I think we're fine.

But, but you know what?

There may be a lot of people who are fans of the band that we are going to talk about here on the show who have never heard our previous show, our previous show.

This is by the way, let me introduce you and you can introduce me.

Sure.

I mean, I'm just going to say, one of the finest actors of my generation, you know, is certainly in the generation above me, you have your deniros, you have your brandos, you have your pecanos.

But of my generation, once that I mean, they were all like acting long before I was around.

You know, I mean, it's the elder statesman.

But of my generation, you have who?

You have Eddie Norts?

The old Ed Nort.

Ed Nort.

And then what?

And then what, then nobody?

It's a barren, barren field.

It's a wasteland out there of acting.

I mean, there's no one.

There's no one good.

No one good.

So he's one of the finest actors I know.

He can do it all.

He can do comedy.

That's sort of funny.

It's up for debate.

You can do drama that's not that dramatic, but he's like, sometimes he'll say a line and you'll be like, oh, he's more of a comedy guy.

And then you watch him in a comedy, you're like, maybe he's a drama guy.

It's almost like you, I'm kind of a, you would categorize me as a tweener.

Sure.

Does someone who kind of just falls between the tracks?

I don't think that word means what you think it means.

It doesn't sound like something completely different.

It really does.

He is currently on a show ghosted, which is on the Fox network.

And you know him from Parks and Rec.

You know him from tell me lies, tell me big little lies.

Which I have not seen.

And I'm just going to say it, nor will I.

And you really did say it.

You really did say it.

And I don't care.

I know as long as those checks clear, baby.

Are the checks clearing, by the way?

I know HBO had a problem for a little.

Every single one.

I was really scared to.

I brought that thing down to the inside.

I remember I went to the bank with you that one day and your hands were shaking.

Yep, I need you to come with me.

Yeah, just moral support.

I need someone to bear witness.

This is a legal transfer we're going to do.

Now you asked me to wear a mask of Richard Nixon.

Yes.

And carry a semi-automatic weapon as well.

That's right.

And I wore a mask of Ronald Reagan.

And I carried three grenades and a pistol.

Right.

And both of us were wearing dynamite strapped to our bodies.

With bulletproof vest, just in case anyone shot it.

Just because anyone wanted to shoot the dynamite.

Exactly.

Yeah.

We went into the bank and I was like, Scott, just stay by my side.

Your hands were shaking so badly.

Take the safety off of your automatic weapon.

Oh, yeah.

Good tip.

Stand by my side.

We're going to go in the bank and we're just going to simply cash my check.

But before I do that, right when we walk in the doors, I need you to scream everybody down on the ground.

This is a robbery.

Now, those words to me, I don't know, individually, they mean something together.

I had no idea what they, you know.

Out of context, it's meaningless.

Yeah, it's gibberish.

Right.

And that's why I wanted you to say it.

It was a fun game.

It was.

It was really fun.

And now we're very rich men, very, very rich men.

And we possibly shouldn't have admitted to this.

We might want to cut this out.

Let's definitely cut this out.

I want to welcome him back to the co-hosting chair.

Adam Scott is here.

Hey.

Go, no, go ahead and give me a nice.

Yeah.

Sitting across the old tabla from me, which is French for table, is a man who is sitting in a chair and there's a wall behind him in front of him, a microphone.

Not as good as mine.

Beneath him, wheels upon the chair, he is sitting and right in front of him, a tabla.

This is Scott Ockerman.

Yeah.

I just, I said some really nice things about you.

I gave credits.

Well, I said that there was a wall behind you.

You're obviously more famous than me.

Oh, Scott.

You're the person who doesn't need the introduction.

I don't know one who does need it.

I said that there was a tabla in front of you and that you were wearing clothes.

Did you mention I was wearing clothes?

Yeah, it's part of the, it's written right here.

It's the introduction.

I'm supposed to be.

Anyway.

Anyway, I think the world of you.

Certainly, you're incredibly talented.

You've always been two things to me.

One.

One, a person who, when I see you on that screen, be it large, be it small, I think to myself.

Yeah, he got another one.

And secondly, you've been a wonderful, wonderful supporter of me.

Yes, I've always been.

Well, I've always been a firm supporter of the arts, certainly the arts in general.

And I fall within that umbrella.

Well, you know, in spite of that, I have been supportive of you.

Thank you very much.

We had a show called You Talking You Two to Me where we discussed the band.

You two.

At length.

For 24 episodes or so at this point, we really milked that for as long as we could.

We squeezed that raw milk.

We squeezed them titties.

Jesus.

We like imagine Bono on his hands and knees and we're just like underneath him like milking his tits.

Okay.

All right.

You're amazing.

Yeah.

Why do you have the world's biggest erection right now?

Wait, can we get the Guinness Book of World Records in here?

Because I think you might be right.

That's right.

Four inches.

But we talked about you two.

Check out that show if you are interested at all and haven't heard it.

We went through the entire band's catalog, took some interesting side bars along the way.

And we talked to the band themselves.

Talk to the band themselves.

Check out all of those episodes.

Now while we were doing it, look, we love it if you two had 1000 more albums to talk about, of course we would.

Sure.

We'd have 1000 more episodes of a podcast to make.

Exactly.

And we would love that.

We would.

But you two are not the most prolific band, meaning they're not putting out one album a day.

Right.

They, they put out one album every few years with a few songs of experience.

They're 14th album.

They've been around Scott, nine upon 37 years at 30 some odd years.

Something like that.

They put out 14 albums.

To me, that's just fucking lazy.

That's, you know what?

You two.

Step it up.

Yeah.

Take it up a couple of notches.

I don't want to say like, take it up a couple of notches.

I mean, you're like, how many episodes of television have you been on?

I mean, let's see.

At least four or five episodes of television.

Yeah, exactly.

I've been an actor now for what, like 20 years.

20 years.

And you've made four or five episodes of television.

Right.

But make no mistake, making an episode of television takes.

It's so much harder than making an album.

Making an album is something like you said, you could put out an album of music every day.

You could put out an album of music every day.

Like how hard is it?

First of all, albums are what?

30, 40 minutes, 50 minutes, 80 at most.

And playing a musical instrument is like the most simple thing.

Well, the thing is, is you can play the musical instrument while you record it and probably should.

Well, yeah, that's what they do when they record an album.

They go in, they sit down, they're like, okay, give me that guitar.

You take that drum, switch on the recording machine and then...

And then they go, okay, 40 minutes later, it's out.

And they just decide to do that the night before they release an album like every four years.

Exactly.

So I don't know why YouTube doesn't have more records out, but we ran out.

We ran out of records.

Yeah.

But we didn't run out of tape nor desire to keep this going.

That's right.

And so when we thought, well, what do we do next?

What is it?

What is that thing?

Where's the special sauce?

No, and so much of what we do is inspiration, but I have to admit a lot of it is perspiration.

Oh man, you smell terrible.

You smell great.

Thank you so much.

So there are very few bands who have had decade spanning careers, nor the impact on the two of us.

Exactly.

But that's part of it is both of these bands started around the same time and they got sort of popular around the same years and years where we were just primed for these bands to hit us right in the butthole.

Yep.

And they were making music for our buttholes at the time that our buttholes were at that exact age where they were ready to receive all of this great music.

I'm so sorry.

So the bands that we decided to segue onto, they have many records, much like you two did.

They had several records that defined generations that changed the course of pop music.

That changed the very course of pop music itself.

That's right.

Of course we are talking about the band.

Do you have brothers?

The doops.

Yes.

Har-e-m.

They, what a wonderful combination of people and musicians.

Am I right in this?

For me, REM is my favorite band, but even higher than you two as a kid.

They, when I discovered them and it wasn't as early as I think you did but- We'll get into it.

Certainly.

Okay.

Certainly.

But you love REM.

I love REM.

I think they're just an incredible band and they, you know, I was at the perfect age when they were hitting it at the perfect time.

We'll talk exactly about what age you were, what- If I was a little boy or not.

Or a big boy who knows what you were.

And what we're going to do in this series is we're going to take REM record by record and just talk about what we like about it, talk about what we don't like about it.

And look, if you've heard the YouTube show, we don't like everything you do put out, right?

That's right.

We gave them a little Tisk-tisk-naughty boys for some of those records.

That's right.

We sure did.

We took them to Tisk.

We took them out to the woodshed and we gave them a whipping.

We gave you to a whooping when it came to some of those records.

Oh man.

And they are shaking in their boots.

That song get on you boots?

That they get on.

Yeah, that was all about exactly what was going to happen when we started this podcast.

What's interesting, I think, about the two of us is we have two very different opinions of REM.

I think not in a bad way.

And we'll get into it.

But there are bands that I love and have all of their songs that they put out.

Yes.

But so we are coming from that place of we both are collectors.

We have all their songs.

We spend a lot of time thinking about REM.

But we have very different opinions on it.

Because I'm the more fanatical fan and you may be more measured.

Exactly.

But we'll figure out exactly when that occurs and there's a lot to come here on the several episodes.

We're going to do several episodes of this as long as we can.

And as long as people want to keep listening.

Exactly.

Although I would kind of a big ask.

And I will say the minute people want to stop listening, this podcast will just stop.

Really all you have to do is think it.

Second.

It will just stop.

Yeah.

So let me think it just now.

Wait, you wanted to stop.

And now we start again.

Yeah.

You wanted to start again.

It's crazy how that actually works.

Yeah, I am really, I have to say I'm really excited to do this because like I said, I'm a big fan and I love talking about these records.

Yes.

This is some of the best music.

And I want to say that I, since we decided to do this, have started to go back into a deep dive of their music.

And it's been very invigorating for me to re-listen to a lot of these records.

These records are incredible.

And we're going to get into a lot of things over their career.

We're going to get into their videos.

We're going to get into the magazine covers, the awards ceremonies.

Awards.

We're going to get into it all.

All of it.

We're going to get into it all.

But I think we need to start where we always start.

Yep.

We did it with the previous band, U2.

And now with Hari M, we need to start with who are the people in this band?

What are the names of the band members?

The band members names.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

So who do we got?

Let's run them down.

First of all, I believe, and this is the comprehensive and encyclopedic compendium of all things R.E.M.

It sure is.

So of course, we're going to start with the band members.

And we know it all.

That's the other part that a lot of people listening don't know is we're experts.

Yeah.

We know the names of the band members by heart.

By heart.

They're in our brains.

We don't have to look it up on a phone.

We don't have to look it up.

No, although would you mind starting because?

Yeah, let me get it on my phone here.

Okay.

Yeah.

I'm just kidding.

I know it by heart.

Sure.

I'm a fan.

Right.

Let's run them down.

We have on, he holds a microphone.

He sings.

Sure.

I mean, that's reductive in a lot of ways.

If you're holding a microphone, of course you're singing.

Of course you do.

But I mean, he does so much.

How can you just reduce it down to he sings?

I know.

You're right.

You know, it's like, I'm the singer.

No, no, no, he does a lot more than that.

He's so much more than that.

It's a charismatic front man.

Sure.

That's none can dispute that.

Incredible songwriter.

Right.

Words that.

Right.

Lyrics even sings them out loud.

He sings them out loud in front of people and sometimes to himself I would imagine.

Sure.

Why not?

Like why wouldn't he sing in the shower?

If you're this guy, why wouldn't you?

Like, if you're one of the most famous singers in the world, can you imagine Frank Sinatra?

Right.

He gets into a shower.

He disrobes.

Yeah.

He's got that just that Sinatra bod.

Oh man, he's got that six-piece man bod.

Yeah, just like the hairy belly that's overflowing over the polyester bands.

Oh my goodness.

And you know back then, they took showers in their polyester bands.

He did.

Can you imagine him getting into the shower and one of his many wives?

Who do we got?

We got Ava.

We have Nancy.

Oh yeah, we got Joe's.

No, Nancy was his daughter.

Yeah, Joe Joe.

Barbara, Jojo.

Uh, Josie, Gidget.

In cushion.

We got the old pin cushion, of course.

Yeah.

Can you imagine one of them coming in and saying, hey, Frank, do you mind singing in the shower?

You have such a wonderful voice and you're saying, no thanks, baby.

As if you.

I'm off the clock.

Baby.

Hey, hey.

Hey, tuts, I'm going to do it my way.

Da na na na.

He would never do that.

My way.

Hsing it.

Now get out of here.

Get the fuck out of here.

Get the fucking bricks.

Hey, get the fuck out.

Don't let the door.

Hey, it's a fuck out.

Hickory dickory duck.

Can you imagine that?

If Andrew Dice Clay was Frank Sinatra, he would love that.

I bet.

I am.

No, he would never do that.

I can only imagine in the shower he would be.

That's life.

Yeah.

She would say, don't say he'd be like one, two, one, two, three, four.

Hey, dude.

He would sing the crankshaft song from Lost.

Hey, everybody.

Wasn't that the song?

I come on, everybody.

Oh, right, right, right, right.

I thought you said Lamb of Lost.

So I was like trying to catch up.

No, you remember the band?

Crankshaft Lost.

Yeah, yeah.

Anyway, no, he would sing all the time.

And so why would this person, the very lead singer of Hari M, why would he, why would we expect him to never sing?

Well, he was, we cannot, we cannot expect that expectation.

No, of course.

Of course, we're talking about the one and only the main man, the main man, Michael Stypend.

Michael Stypend.

There he is.

The main man, the front man.

That's for one of the greatest bands in the history of music.

That's him in that light that you shine from the back of the house.

Michael Stypend.

Now, moving on.

It's Stypend or Stypend?

Stypend.

Okay.

It's Stypend and then an ampersand.

Gotcha.

That's, that's, I already knew that because that's his name.

Of course, that's his name.

Moving on to the get fiddle.

The old guitar.

The old six string.

Rainy, Rainy, Rainy.

What, what, what, what, what, what.

I don't know.

Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d.

Bam.

What I got, you got to give it to your mama.

What I got, you got to give it to your papa.

Um, he sings that, I believe.

Yeah.

That's an REM song.

Uh, we have, uh, of course he, he's one of the best instrumentalists to ever be in the game.

Uh, yeah.

He's, uh, a, a disciplined, uh, prolific, um, incredible songwriter and guitar player.

Multi-instrumentalist.

He played drums on a couple of REM songs.

Yeah.

He's a great.

If it makes sound, uh, yeah, I think he played it.

I think he can, uh, you know, make something.

Yeah, I think, well, we're in safe hands with him.

Seriously, you give this guy a coffee cup.

Sure.

Just a coffee, just your regular dime store coffee cup that you pick up off the street.

Sure.

Maybe something to slap against it.

Sure.

Let's go.

Make a hit song.

One hit song.

Uh, it's sure.

He can't make two hit songs out of it.

No, no, no, no.

Are you kidding me?

That's insane.

You, all you've given him is a coffee cup.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

But one hit song?

Oh, yeah.

Of course we're talking about Peter Dollar Bill.

Peter Dollar Bill in the house.

In the fucking house.

Redding it up on the old Rickenbocker.

Oh, that's a old Ricky.

Oh, Ricky is so fine.

You're so fine.

You blow my mind.

Hey, Ricky.

He does not clap his hands though.

He can't do that.

He can't.

He can't do that.

He, he, he actually, I don't know that he has hands.

Have you ever seen a, a Hari M video with his hands in it?

A Hari M videos I've seen he doesn't, he never shows his hands.

It's one of the mysterious things about the group.

What's that?

They have two types of guitars in their band.

Hold on.

What?

This is very common for bands.

This is very, it's almost like rock and roll 101.

Sorry, you're saying this is common for bands, but to me that sounds insane.

It actually, and Adam, what I want you to do is I want you to go home tonight.

Okay.

And I want you to turn on YouTube.

And I want you to just type in band band and you'll, a video will come up.

You'll click on that.

It'll take you to another video, another video.

Suddenly you're down a YouTube hole.

Oh boy.

I've been down those before.

It gets sucked in for hours.

Next thing I know I'm watching a, a, a oval teen commercial from when I was seven years old, you know, you just can't.

You uploaded.

Oh, of course.

Oh my gosh.

Well, you're going to notice though that most bands have two different types of guitars in them.

Wait a second.

Now the, the, the one, the Peter dollar bill plays that we were just talking about.

Yeah.

He plays four strings.

Uh huh.

This guy, he plays one with four.

Four guitars.

He plays four guitars.

Four guitars.

Yeah.

And they all have four strings.

He's a 16 stringer.

Wow.

So does he has 16 hands.

He does not know he has 16 fingers.

16 fingers.

Okay.

That makes more sense.

Yeah.

It makes more sense.

Now he makes up for Peter dollar bill who does not have hands by no hands.

Six extra fingers.

Six.

And weirdly the extra six are on one hand.

Did this guy steal fingers from Peter dollar bill?

I think what happened.

That's not in the Wikipedia, which by the way is our only resource for information on this band.

We don't know anything about them other than that.

No, we just were introduced to them today.

Right.

Let's talk about him.

He, he sings harmonies.

Harmonies.

He plays piano.

He radiates on the 88s.

Piano, keybirds.

Mm hmm.

He plays bass guitar.

The bass guitar.

Of course we're talking about.

Of course we're talking about Mike Miller.

Mike Miller, the one, the only Mike Miller bass guitar keyboards and everything in between.

Everything in between.

Lead vocals sometimes.

Yeah, very occasionally.

Incredible singer.

Well, I wonder what the difference is between a lead vocalist and a person who's not a lead vocalist.

Well, say you have, okay, the band we did the podcast about before, Benobos.

Yeah, I sort of remember them.

Okay, Hugh too.

Yeah, right.

Okay.

Benobos was the lead singer of that band, right?

You know the guy he was singing.

You didn't really think that ever came up.

Okay.

Well then, let me just tell you really quickly, the guitar player, his name was Fedge.

Fedge, right.

And then we had a bass guitar player, his name was Adam, Adam, £2,000, right?

Right.

And then the drummer, as you know, was Larry Mullins, Sr.'s son.

Mm-hmm.

The fourth member of the group is named Benobos and he was the singer.

He was the lead singer.

Other people would do backup vocals sometimes, but he's the one that was singing the lead vocals for all of the songs.

Oh, okay, got it.

Got it.

I'm locked in now.

A ch, ch, ch.

Safety off, buddy.

Safety off at this point.

Now we've only talked about three people and I know a lot of you are saying like, oh, that's probably it.

Yeah.

That's a band right there.

Yeah, it is.

Isn't that the one more than the white stripes?

Right.

But no, there actually is one more person.

And this guy is hard to spot sometimes.

Uh-huh.

Because he's sitting behind a lot of...

Oh, right.

Yeah, he's a lot of...

A lot of...

He's like, sometimes you're like, oh, is he sitting behind a bunch of crates or boxes or...?

Right.

I saw a picture of them today.

I was like, what are those round boxes in front of them?

Like, I can barely...

Like, what's he holding?

Are these hats?

Right.

What are...

Why is he striking hat boxes with his long E.T. fingers?

Yeah, and huge fingers with pencils on it.

Yeah, I don't know.

It's confusing.

I didn't understand what was going on.

It's very, very confusing.

So, Adam, don't think less of yourself because when you just look at a picture like that, it's very confusing.

Sometimes you need to see several pictures.

Sometimes you just need someone to explain it to you.

I thought there was only one picture that we could look at.

And so, I was just looking at that like, what the fuck is going on?

They're actually...

And this is interesting.

There are actually 12 pictures of this band.

I have only...

I didn't know there were 11 more.

There's 11 more pictures.

I got...

I'm going to show you the other 11 because you've got to see these.

Thank you.

He plays what I call...

But I'm a music fan.

I call them the drums.

The drums.

Okay.

Yep.

All right, well, agree to disagree.

Okay.

Do you call them the poundums?

Oh, yeah.

You mean the things you hit with drumsticks?

Yes.

Exactly.

He's a...

Yeah, I call them drums and poundumsticks.

Okay.

Well, I call them poundums and drumsticks.

Okay, yeah.

So, very...

It's west of the Mississippi.

And then when I have a chicken leg, I call that a poundum stick.

Oh, dude.

Interesting.

We know, of course, who he is.

It's slapping the skins.

Yep.

It's buckberry.

Buckberry.

Mm-hmm.

Buckberry?

Yeah.

Okay.

Buck.

Great.

Yeah, he's a great drummer.

Incredible.

Incredible at it.

Incredible songwriter as well.

Great singer.

I'll take your word for that.

I'm a fan, but I guess I haven't gone that deep into it.

Well, he did backup vocals and stuff.

I mean, I...

You know, I have never heard those vocals, I guess.

But yeah, buckberry.

Terrific.

Oh, my goodness.

It's quite a name.

Quite a name.

You got a Peter Dollar bill over there.

And then buckberry.

Yeah.

Boy, we got all the names out.

So that's what...

That's what it means, finally.

People have to memorize, or because those names are going to disappear from our consciousness.

Those names are going to come up a lot, actually.

They're...

We're going to be talking about these people a lot on this.

So you have to know who we're talking about.

So if I were you, I would maybe write these things down.

Maybe make a voice memo to yourself, email it to yourself.

There's a lot of ways around this problem now.

Now the technology has advanced to the point where...

It's not...

We don't need these posted notes.

Who needs it?

A little yellow thing that's stuck all over it.

Post-it notes?

They were great for several years.

We needed them.

But guess what?

We don't need them anymore.

Not anymore.

And they're annoying.

Oh, my God.

Remember the days before the Post-it note, though?

Yeah.

You had to get like a big tub of glue and put it on your paper.

Well, you had to buy paper and cut the paper up into a bunch of small pieces.

Smaller pieces and then squirt.

Like glue on it.

A bunch of glue on the back and stick it to your computer screen.

Oh, my God.

Gross.

And then you stick it onto some Post-it notes you had lying around.

Yeah, they grab your Post-it notes and throw them in the garbage.

Right.

And then cut up your paper.

Oh, my God.

So we're going to be talking about the band.

We're going to be talking about today's episode.

We're going to be talking about their very first releases.

And we're talking about, of course, the title of this episode, Chronic Town, their very first EP.

Before we get to that, though, we need to take a little break.

What do you think of that?

I think that sounds good to me.

To me.

Mm-hmm.

Very good.

So I would quickly just like to say goodbye to my friends.

I would like to say goodbye to my family.

I would like to say goodbye to my fans.

And most of all, Scott, I would like to say goodbye to you.

Thank you very much.

I imagine during the break, we're just going to sit here staring at each other.

Yeah.

So no need necessarily to say goodbye, but I appreciate it.

And you've never said goodbye to me.

So this is a very special day.

So thank you so much.

There's a first time for everything, Scott.

There certainly, certainly is.

Speaking of first times, this is our first time on the show.

Whoa.

So we are going to be right back with more.

Shh.

Are you talking?

R-E-M-R-E-M-R-E-M-E?

We are going to be right back.

One, two, three.

Welcome back to R-E-U talking R-E-M-R-E-M-R-E-M-R-E-M-E.

This is Scott.

And this is Scott.

And we are back.

Adam took a, what's become a little bit of a tradition here on the show.

He took a squirt.

Had to go down the hallway and shake a little do off the daisy.

He certainly did.

There probably has not been an episode where you haven't done that right after the first segment.

I enjoy it.

It leads me to believe that- I don't masturbate.

Because you're so turned on by either talking about these bands or me.

I don't know.

And I don't want to know.

Either that or on the co-catic.

It could be.

Could be.

Welcome back.

You're talking about the band R-E-M, of course.

And we have been talking about them exclusively.

Nothing else.

And this is exciting because you only get one of these first episodes.

You know what I mean?

You only get one.

You know, Scott, you're so right.

It's like going to a really good movie.

Walk in.

Wait, wait, wait.

Is this an episode of I Love Films?

I think it might be.

Hey, welcome to I Love Films.

This is Scott.

And this is Scott.

And today we're talking about film.

And Adam, just before we came on air, was talking about it's like when you go and sit down at a really good movie.

Adam, movie.

You know, you go in.

Now, I don't like movies that much.

Oh, listen.

Neither do I.

But I love film.

I love films.

Films.

I fucking love it.

I love going in.

You smell the popcorn.

Sell you Lloyd.

You get the ticket.

You go.

It's made of Lloyd, dumb and dumber.

The ticket ticker.

Just a movie.

They tear your ticket.

But film.

Films.

Like the god.

Rip.

That ticket just ripping in half.

You sit down in the chair.

You feel it.

Sweet.

And it with spism.

And then, you know, zip.

Mrs. Robinson.

Oh my gosh, are you trying to seduce me?

Hey, listen.

That is a film.

It's a film.

Mike.

No.

Five cents.

Yeah.

Oh my gosh.

The best.

Wonderful, wonderful.

There's no other way to put a filmmaker.

You know, I'm going to be controversial here and I'm going to say that I'm going to go.

Here comes.

Just go out.

Just, just listen.

Release the house.

Just listen.

I really like carnal knowledge.

Maybe even more than the graduate.

Not as many people have seen it, but I love it.

I don't even know what you're talking about when you say those two words together.

They feel like four syllables maybe.

I don't know.

I know.

It's more of an underground favorite, but I love it.

Speaking of undergrounds, Kate Peckinsale, Komi.

Yeah.

Very attractive.

I may be thinking of underworld.

Uh huh.

No, it's under underground.

It's underground.

Underground.

Well, that's been an episode of I Love Films.

Goodbye.

Good app.

Great app.

Really great.

Really good.

I loved it.

Sometimes we're too hard on ourselves, but I have to say I love that podcast.

I love doing it.

Yeah.

I wish we could do that.

We can.

Listen.

Is this an episode of I Love, I Love Films?

I think it might be.

Hey, welcome to I Love, I Love Films.

This is Scott.

And this is Scott.

And we're just here talking about the podcast I Love Films.

I love I Love Films.

It's so good.

Those guys, they know what they're talking about.

You know what?

They give a shit.

Excuse my language.

The gish.

I will never excuse that because that is unforgivable.

Speaking of unforgivable, Kate Peckinsale, Komi.

Great actress.

Very attractive woman.

I may be thinking of Clint Eastwood.

Same thing.

Same thing to me.

Same person.

Kate Peckinsale, get in that empty chair.

If you know what I mean.

Oh, the empty chair is my lap.

All right.

This is I Love, I Love Films.

Goodbye.

Oh, even better.

That might be the best episode of anything that's ever existed in the history of this past 25 seconds.

It may be because everyone's asleep because it's late at night while we're doing this.

Yes.

I don't even know why we were talking about it, but I would never pass it up.

Talking about it because.

Kate Peckinsale.

Yeah.

Oh my gosh.

But why were we talking about it's like when you go to a movie?

I don't even remember.

But here we are.

We're going to be talking about.

We're here.

We're doing it.

We're talking about the band, Hari M and nothing else.

And oh yes, you only get one of these first episodes.

And when you step up to the plate, you got to take a mighty swing.

Yeah, listen, they might throw you a knuckle ball.

They might throw you a curve ball, but you got to swing the bat.

How about a slider?

It's not just for dinner plates anymore.

Listen, it might go high and outside.

I'm still going to take a swing.

Knuckle ball?

Yeah, I'm going to take a swing.

Yeah.

What about a bean ball?

Take a swing.

Straight at the head.

Take a swing.

Just take a swing out.

Just swatted away.

Yes.

You have to because when you only get one chance.

You get one shot.

One of them.

One of them, by the way, speaking of one shot, have you seen Hamilton?

Yes.

Where did you see it?

Here in LA?

Here in LA and in New York City, Big Apple.

How did you get your tickets here in LA?

I got my tickets here in LA.

I...

God, I don't know.

You don't just...

They just showed up.

The Hamilton ferry came down your chimney?

Yes, I don't remember.

You don't remember.

I really don't.

You know how everyone out there is like, how do I get my Hamilton tickets?

Oh, they're so expensive.

I don't know how to get them.

You don't remember.

I remember in New York, I asked my agent if I could get tickets because it was difficult.

But here I don't remember how exactly I did that.

You just kind of showed up.

I don't think it's as difficult here in LA as...

It's pretty difficult.

It is.

Did you see it here?

I have not seen it here.

I've been going on the lottery every day and no luck at this point.

Are you serious?

I am serious.

You can get tickets to Hamilton.

Well, if you pay up the nose and up the butt around the corner for him, sure.

Well, sure, but I like going up the button around the corner.

I bet you it's.

I did see it in New York and...

Did you see the original?

I saw the original, yes.

I did not.

Manuel Miranda was very nice to give me house seats, not give me.

I asked for them.

Yes, I paid for them.

I paid for them, but it was very nice to at cost.

Give me the wonderful seats next to Ben Schwartz.

And they sing that in...

You only get one hand?

They sing...

Lose yourself in the moment.

You know.

And never let it go.

Hey!

George Hamilton sings that in the show.

That show is about George Hamilton.

Yes, it's about...

It goes all the way up to Love It First Bite and then he slips on that Dracula cowl, turns to the camera and goes, I think I'm ready to bite something.

Curtin.

And then it just skips ahead to Godfather III and it ends.

Yep, yeah.

There's a hole just...

It's a...

What we call in the movie is a post-credit scene.

You know, I...

Sorry, I feel like this might be another episode of I Love Films.

I think we segued into one, yeah.

Hey, this is I Love Films.

This is Scott.

This is also Scott and...

We're talking about Godfather III.

I think one of the post-credit scenes.

One of the greatest moves ever made by one of our premier American writers.

Can I tell you something?

Uh, can I finish my sentence?

Godfather II?

I think it's better than Godfather I.

Wait a second.

Hold on, because I was...

I was gonna say the same thing, but I was afraid of what people might say.

What are the better sequels out there?

You think Godfather II is actually better than the Godfather?

I just...

There's something about it that I think the quality is so much better.

It's just epic, okay?

They go back, they show Vito Corleone.

They're in the past.

They're in the present.

They're in the future.

And just the redemption.

Oh, the redemption.

The smooch.

Remember the smooch?

Big old smooch just because you see lips.

I knew it was you.

I knew it was you, Fredo.

What I was gonna say is one of my favorite things that any premier American director has done is when Francis Furcoppola couldn't get Robert DeValda be in Godfather III.

Big disappointment.

Robert DeVald, you know, he wanted...

I mean, it's a paltry sum these days.

He wanted an extra $5 million.

Yeah, which is nothing now.

Nothing.

But at the time...

At the time it was Big Bucks.

It was Big Bucks.

And so he couldn't get him.

So who did he replace him with?

George Hamilton.

Great move.

Such a...

Some call it a lateral move.

Yeah.

No.

Straight up.

Maybe if you're on your side and you're making a lateral move up vertically...

Maybe if you have extreme vertigo and you can't tell ups and downs.

Even vertigo.

Yeah.

Is this an episode of You Talking You Two to Me?

I think it might be.

Hey, welcome to You Talking You Two to Me.

The...

From Boy to Boots.

Getting the mom that is, this is You Talking You Two to Me.

The...

Cicyclopaedic.

And...

Comprehensive.

Comprehensive compendium of all things You Two.

This is good rock and roll music.

We're talking about vertigo.

Yeah.

This is a song by...

I like it.

Me too.

Good app.

Yeah, that was a great app.

So we're back in...

I love films.

And I have to say that Godfather 3 again.

So much better than Godfather 2 or 1.

By a mile.

By a full kilometer.

Okay.

That's what I'm talking about.

You know what?

10 kilometers.

A marathon, 26.2 kilometers.

Infinity kilometers.

That's how good Godfather 3 is.

That's how good it is.

I love it.

Ugh.

Sophia, I knew you were going to be a great director when I saw you up there on that screen.

I actually do like lots of things about Godfather 3.

Yeah, I love films.

Good app.

Yeah, that was a great app.

Oh man.

We're in the thick of it.

Yeah.

But you only get one of these.

So I'm going to swing for the fences.

You know, enough of these buns that so many podcasts take.

Oh yeah.

You know what I mean?

I'm not going to let that guy walk me.

I'm going to take a swing.

No, I'm not going to let him hit me in the old noggin.

Big old dick.

You are swinging your dick.

I'm sorry.

Back and forth.

I am sorry.

So what I want to do in this segment is we're talking about the Bann-Hariam exclusively in this podcast.

And I want to just, like we did with the YouTube show, I want to talk about the Bann-generally before we get into Chrono-Kronach time and their early songs.

And I just kind of want to talk and see where we both started with them.

Not getting into the future necessarily, but I want to hear basically Adam, what I'm trying to say is when did you first hear of R.E.M.?

For me.

Just for me.

I first heard of them back when they had their first big top 10 hit, The One I Love, and that was on MTV.

1987, I believe.

1987.

And I thought the video was...

You were watching MTV?

Yeah.

The video was really weird.

I don't remember what happens in it.

In the video?

Really?

I don't remember.

It was a great video.

Oh, a lot of videos, the videos that I remember are probably 82 through 85 maybe, are the ones that I remember the most.

Okay, so you remember no music videos after 1985?

I remember Van Halen's right now.

That's those words.

That's a great video.

Pepsi.

And a great song.

Right.

And that how.

But I don't recall the exact intricacies of The One I Love, as you said, describe it.

The One I Love video is...

Turn your fucking phone off.

Super artsy far.

Oh, it's our mutual friend.

But no, it's a great video.

And there's no lip syncing in it.

It's weird.

The band isn't really in it.

It's just a weird collage of images.

And it's really cool.

And the song itself really catchy, but also sounded different than anything I was listening to at that time.

What were you listening to at the time?

This is 1987.

How old are you?

1987.

How old are you?

Right now I'm 44.

I'm going to go back to 1987.

You really have to go backwards from where you are now.

No, I'm going forward from my birthday.

I'm going forward from my birthday, but I was 14 years old.

So never won an award for mathematics.

I'm not claiming to be at standard birthday.

How old were you in 1986?

16.

Wow.

That's not bad.

Well, I was born in even your 70s.

So it's very easy for me to figure this stuff out.

At the time I was listening to Bob Marley and the Grateful Dead.

That was...

She's calling me now.

Really?

She knows this is happening and is very excited.

I'm going to text her.

Go ahead.

So Bob Marley and the Grateful Dead were kind of my main two bands at the time.

Bob Marley and the Grateful Dead when you're 14.

Yeah, I was...

So R-E-M, that song was a big hit and then it's the end of the world as we know it.

And for Christmas, 1987, my brother got me document, the album with...

Whoa!

And I love this stuff.

And it really blew my mind.

I remember I had a learner's permit.

Hold on, hold on.

Let's back up a little bit.

So 1987, the one I love comes out.

I can't recall if that was a summer record or a fall.

It was a fall record.

Your brother, older brother or younger brother?

I don't think we've talked about him at this point.

David Scott.

David Scott, you know?

Dave Scott for those who know his love.

My middle name is David.

You're what?

My middle name is David.

Caris.

Okay.

So he's older.

He sees you enjoying this or did you walk around saying like, I really...

Yeah, we...

Did you talk about music with him?

He really got me into music and introduced me to Led Zeppelin and all the...

R-E-M, R-E-M, R-E-M, R-E-M, R-E-M.

Yeah, Stairway to Heaven is one of their songs.

There's a lady who knows that she's walking up the stairs and we're in Heaven now.

We're in Heaven now.

Look at all these guys with all these harps.

And I remember that summer too.

We listened to the Joshua Tree by U2.

U2?

Okay, so now you were into U2 at this point or no?

Well, I was...

Because when...

You went to the Us Festival, we talked about this for U2.

Yeah, but that was in 1983.

You were just a little boy at this point.

And so I remember that summer he was like, this is U2.

This is the Joshua Tree.

This album is huge.

He introduced that to me over the summer and then when I loved became this thing.

And he was like, yeah, these guys are good.

They've been around a while and this is their first hit and he got...

So he knew a little bit about them.

A bit, yeah.

A bit.

And he got me that album, the cassette of it.

Did he own it as well?

I believe so.

Okay.

I believe so.

And then...

And I remember the Christmas day when I got it, I was actually 15 by this point.

And I got in the car because my learner's permit was driving my mom and I put document in her cassette player and finest work song came on.

And it's a really loud kind of burst of sound.

Really jarring, sharp, just a jarring song.

And I was just like, wow, this is incredible.

But I was driving her car and she made me turn it off because it was too loud and crazy.

Too loud and distracting while I was driving her car.

You shouldn't be listening...

Freaked out about it.

You shouldn't be listening to songs while you're learning how to drive.

You shouldn't, especially songs that are about crashing a car, which is what finest work song is about.

Yeah, I mean, Crash Test Dummies.

That's the worst band to listen to.

And that's my other favorite band.

Would not surprise me.

So that's when I really got into them.

I wasn't really aware of them before that because they just weren't really on my radar as a 14-year-old.

As a 14-year-old boy.

But you were already into you two or you were not into you two.

I can't remember.

A bit.

I got into them with Rattle and Hum, right?

No, I got into them with Joshua Tree, but it was around that time that I was just sort of getting into the music of the day and kind of starting to shed the skin of Bob Marley and Grateful Dead and Cream and all that kind of classic rock that as a 14-year-old and Santa Cruz.

Well, you had to learn the bass.

Yes, you know what I mean?

Like I grew up listening to the Beatles and you have to learn what pop music is in order to start to then appreciate alternative in a way.

Yeah, exactly.

And Huey Lewis in the news and Michael Jackson was kind of what came before.

That's the big one for me, by the way.

Huey Lewis.

I mentioned it in an interview that just came out today of like when I was 14, Huey Lewis was huge.

Sports had come out.

And I walked around school wearing a Huey Lewis in the news.

T-shirt that I made my friend who went to the concert by me.

Wow.

I bet you wish you still had that T-shirt.

I actually do.

It was so cool.

But then when I was 15, then I started getting into alternative music.

And actually, because we're just a few years off an age, you actually, it's interesting, 87, I think, is around the year that alternative bands started to go huge.

Yeah.

You two, which had been kind of an alternative band.

Tied in the name of love certainly was kind of a minor.

Yeah, Joshua Tree.

But Joshua Tree went through the stratosphere and so did our game.

And at this exact time, the fall of 87, right when I got the album, they were on the cover of Rolling Stone.

It said America's Best Rock and Roll Band.

That was, it was just like, oh my God, who are these guys?

And I just got document and then started kind of going backwards from there.

So you went, you went backward, literally backwards?

Or did you say, okay, I'm going to start at the beginning and go all the way up or what would you do?

I had document and just listen to that constantly.

And then I think the next album I got was Dead Letter Office.

Which I believe came out right before.

It came out in 86.

Yeah, but at the time, I didn't know that it was just B-Sides.

It was a B-Sides.

Did you ever read, I mean, they talk about, yeah, Peter Buck wrote the liner notes.

Yeah, right.

The liner notes are incredible.

And they go into every single song.

Yeah.

But you didn't realize that it was, I didn't realize it was B-Sides.

I just didn't know.

I just bought the next most recent one and it was Dead Letter Office.

And got really into that.

So by the time I got into reckoning, Voice of Herald is, even now when I listen to Seven Chinese Brothers, I think of the Voice of Herald lyrics rather than the Seven Chinese Brothers lyrics because- Oh, that's interesting.

Yeah.

Because those are the original ones that you heard.

Yeah.

It's him just reading the liner notes of a gospel album along with the Seven Chinese Brothers tune.

So you, so with reckoning, would you say then that- You mean document?

Sorry, document.

Yeah.

So with document, would you say that that is the, it's the, normally a lot of times our favorite things are the first ones we hear.

Right.

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

Would you say that that then, and I don't want to talk about what your favorite record is because we're, you know, the document episode is coming down the line.

But does that hold a certain fond place in your heart because of that?

Yeah.

Document is one that I continually go back to.

I think it is its own masterpiece.

It's a really complicated album with a lot of- By the way, if you listen to the show, you're going to hear a lot of these- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

It's such a mark.

No, it's great.

This is why you want to do the show.

But I think that it wasn't until the following year, they used to put out an album every year.

The following year when Green came out that I was like, okay, these are my guys.

And I took a deep dive and really went back and got all the way back after Green.

Interesting.

So you had the first, you had those two.

I had recced document and dead letter office.

Dead letter office.

And then the next year, I remember getting Green on election day of the day it came out and just going, oh my God, these are- And so then you got everything.

Then you want to do the, for the, we've been thinking about doing this podcast for a long, couple years now, or at least the idea of it.

And I wasn't even sure I wanted to do it because if you made fun of REM, it would hurt my feelings.

That's how into these guys I end up always been.

And I am going to make fun of them at some point.

Yeah, sure.

And it's going to hurt my feelings, but I'll be fine.

You'll be okay.

I'm a grown up.

You're a grown S man at this point.

But I do, you know, when you find that band that you're like, I am, these are my guys.

I want to dress like that.

I want to talk.

These are, you know, from you is the Smiths where I would look at their, the only photographs I had of them were the ones on the album.

Yes.

Plot out exactly what they were wearing and go to thrift stores and try to approximate it somehow.

One hundred percent.

And then so then, yeah, so 87 is the first time you ever heard of them and then you're a full blown mega fan by 88.

Yes.

Very good.

Yes.

Very good.

Yes.

How about you?

I believe I'm pretty sure that I had heard some singles on the radio.

I'm pretty sure that I had probably...

Because you are already tuned into alternative music by the time document.

I started to, like I grew up here.

Does that even know what alternative music was at that point?

Yeah.

But if you haven't heard the YouTube show, let me talk about my background a little bit.

I was into top 40.

I grew up in Southern California in Orange County and I listened to Kiss FM.

That was the first, when I was 10, that was the first FM radio.

We got our first FM.

Yeah.

I sound like a million years old.

But like FM was a kind of...

An exotic thing.

An exotic thing at that point.

Because we all just had kind of AM radio.

Some cars had AM radios.

So we finally got an FM receiver when I was 10 in 1980.

And Kiss FM was...

I was then able to listen to Kiss FM.

So Kiss FM was what I listened to and it was like Blondie.

And that was when they were top 40.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

But also stuff like Pass the Duchy.

And they would play like, What's the Matter You?

You know, in the currently shuffle.

You know, so it was...

It was huge.

Yeah.

I remember my brother and I would...

We would call in to Kiss FM.

We would call in to their...

You know what I'm thinking of?

No, wait.

I'm thinking of KFI, first of all.

KFI on AM.

That's AM.

Yeah.

I would listen to KFI on AM.

But that's talk radio.

No, it used to be...

It used to be in top 40.

Oh, really?

Yeah, yeah.

So I was listening to KFI for a while and then in 82 I got my first FM.

Okay.

So when I was 10 I was listening to KFI and we called it the reason I remember it being KFI is because they had a promotion where they had advertisements where people with huge ears were listening to the radio.

And almost like if you listen to pop music, your ears are going to swell up.

And if you ever won a contest, they would give you these fake plastic ears.

Whoa.

And we won five of their calling contests.

And so I had these big fake plastic ears that I used in my plays and in puppet shows for a long time.

Well as...

How old were you at that point?

I was 10.

Like a 10 year old big plastic ears or fucking...

Oh, like their currency.

Oh, totally.

For a dork like me.

Yeah.

So I remember I won like a BG's record and a PAPenitar record and stuff like that.

So in 82 KISS FM, I started listening to KISS FM in 82.

And then, you know, Huey Lewis in the news in 83, 84, you know, Cindy Loper, all that kind of stuff.

And...

God, those are great.

Those are great records.

That's when I started getting into high school, we didn't have MTV.

My friend had it.

I remember I would go over there and see Duran Duran.

Me neither.

My memory of seeing the one I love was at my friend Brian Anderson's house.

I didn't have cable TV.

Brian, what's up?

You listening?

Yeah, so I, you know, that was just prime MTV time.

We didn't have it, but that's what was popular at the time.

The police, Billie Eidle, all that kind of stuff.

So then in 19...

So I liked Huey Lewis and Billie Eidle, whatever was popular.

In 1985, I then got a Smith's record.

I heard, please, please, please lend me cable you want.

On the radio and then you're like that.

And then I got into the Smiths and got into...

Also, I will say the other thing that happened in 1985 was when I was a sophomore, I got seated next to a guy who ended up being my best friend in high school who was very plugged into alternative music.

Yeah, so he was really into the Smiths.

He had this bitch in Smith's poster that I remember up in his room.

He had a whole bunch of posters.

He had a Fables of the Reconstruction poster.

Awesome.

All this kind of stuff, but I didn't really know REM all that much.

Also my other friend also got me into alternative music like X and Devo and all this kind of stuff.

So I had two friends who had all this kind of stuff.

My one friend did not like REM and my other one did.

So I remember he loaned me the Life's Rich pageant.

Okay, but I had heard like radio for you.

Follow on me.

I'd heard them a little bit, especially radio for Europe because that had been on the radio.

So I got Life's Rich pageant and I borrowed it and that became my entry point.

That was in 1986.

That's a good entry point.

And I listened to that over and over and over and over.

What was interesting to me was I had started playing the guitar at the time too and they were all like songs that you could imagine learning.

Totally.

They're all really simple songs.

Oh yeah.

They're like three chords.

His playing is complicated because he's playing all of these arpeggios that are difficult for someone with no skill, like myself to play.

But the chords, like you could just like jing jing jing jing jing.

So I would listen to that over and over.

I have a lot of memories with that record of like I associate it with a couple of things.

One going to the Lomorata Playhouse and seeing, I think I saw the guy who played Isaac in the love boat playing the drill sergeant in Bloxie Blues.

And I was listening to that on the way.

And it was one of those records that I could listen to with my parents and they liked it.

Sure.

You know what I mean?

Because a lot of the stuff like Bauhaus or the Smiths they would complain about.

But I remember the Smitharenes and REM were too that my dad was like, hey, this is pretty good.

I remember that with my parents too, like you could play certain REM stuff.

That's a I think a big key to their success too.

And I know that that Peter Buck for years said they're the acceptable edge of the unacceptable stuff.

Right.

And that's one of the reasons they were able to keep going.

Because they're very built on just kind of classic rock, almost birds style, jangly guitar chords.

Catchy, hoppy stuff.

And not also they're weird.

Yeah, they're a little weird sounding.

That is the one thing that I will say and we'll get into that down the road.

But occasionally you'd listen, I would listen to it around my parents and they would go, well, hold on.

Yeah, exactly.

Like this isn't, you know, I liked it up until this point.

But are you sure you should be listening to this?

So a little bit of edge and a little bit of danger.

But I remember that record associated with that.

And I remember it associated with, I went to the library in Huntington Gardens maybe or Huntington Beach or something.

Yeah.

And the Huntington Gardens in Pasadena?

No, it wasn't.

I think it must have been a Huntington Beach library that was like big and had a lot of stuff.

And I was used to, this is when I got my, it was 86.

So I got my driver's license and I got my first car and I would make tapes of all my records and I would blast them.

And I remember going to this library and they had this record for the soundtrack to this documentary about Athens, Georgia.

Oh, yeah.

Athens Inside Out.

Right.

Yeah.

And I remember I checked that I got a card just so I could check that out of the library so I could tape it.

Oh, yeah.

And make those songs as like at the end of my tape on the Life's Rich Pageant tape that I had.

Yeah, that's awesome.

Yeah.

So that was- So you could fill out the full 90 minute tape.

Right.

Yeah, exactly.

So that was my entry point and then I remember my friend saying Fables was not that great.

Right.

So I sort of didn't really pay attention to that one, but I went back and I got Chronic Town and I got Mermer and I got Reckoning.

And Dead Letter Office came out like after that.

Right.

And I bought that like the day it came out and I was in, that was prime time.

And then, and then for me it was for several years they were one of my favorite bands and every time one of the new records came out I got it the day that it came out.

So when document came out you were like there and ready.

Yes.

I was there and it was all, it was also very thrilling of like, hey, my favorite band is now got a huge hit.

Yeah, the best rock.

And the crazy thing is, is I wasn't even aware of them, but even before document they were like filling the Greek theater, like they were kind of big.

They were really big.

I mean, they talk about it in the history about just, first of all, in the Athens music scene every show more and more people would go and immediately.

And everyone would hate them for that.

Yeah.

I'm strangely enough because if there's something about the songs, they're so, these early REM songs, they're so catchy that just going to a show sounds, it sounds really fun.

Must have been so fun.

Man, these guys were fucking good.

Like right out of the gate.

I have only seen them once.

Oh, really?

What tour?

Green.

Okay.

How many times have you seen them?

I have no idea.

Like zero?

Not at all, not once.

No, I've seen them so many times.

So many times.

Okay.

I've only seen them once.

Green was my first tour that I had seen.

Okay.

I remember that in future episodes.

Yeah.

But I remember what you said about your parents liking them.

I remember that too because I remember I got my parents, my dad had a laser disc player that he borrowed from work.

And so I went- What a dork.

I went and checked out at the library, tour film and Rattle and Hum, or rented them or something and brought them up so I could record the- You check them out at the library.

You don't have to rent them.

No, but I can't remember if I rented them from a video store or a check.

But I brought them up so I could record laser disc quality versions of both of them.

Oh, interesting.

Onto cassette.

Yeah, because did you- I used to do that with live- I did that especially with the crowded house live from MTV Spring Break special that they did.

I videotaped it and then hooked up my stereo so I could have a cassette of it.

Did you go and buy the extra heavy, really good cassettes that- I remember those metal ones.

Yeah, I remember those.

Yeah, was there any difference?

No, no.

It's like the gold CDs as well.

Yeah, stupid.

So I went up and I was making a tape of both Rattle and Hum and tour film so I could have this because there's so much stuff on the Rattle and- in the movie that's not on the album and same with tour film.

And I remember playing them all the way through on the TV while I was recording them and my dad kind of walking in and out of the room and Rattle and Hum is on and he's like, wow, this is great.

These guys are really, really good and this seems like a great movie and band and everything.

And then I remember putting tour film on and it's a really weird concert movie.

Do you remember that one?

It's also- it's shot, yeah.

Yeah, it's shot like with super eight cameras and- Yeah, super grainy and yeah.

And he's like, this is not professional.

Yeah, I don't know what this is.

I'm not sure about this one.

Well, that's what REM always had.

I mean, you two had the thing of- they got so big and they always worked with like, you know, the biggest people, you know what I mean?

And they always worked with old Sourpuss, Brown and Rienino and they always worked with Anton- how do you say his last band?

Corbin, yeah.

I always think it's Corbin Burntson.

It is.

It's the same guy.

Same guy, really?

Yeah, they were always like a- like a playing for the job of the biggest band in the world from day one.

But REM, they always seemed to be like they would never star in their own videos.

Their lyrics would never be audible.

They were always like, we don't want to be popular.

We don't want to be popular.

Yeah.

And that was really cool.

And it was cool when I first saw their videos and it took me a while to even find out what they looked like.

And that was awesome.

And once they did, then that was it.

Yeah, you was in.

Ugh.

So, yeah, so there was a whole- they were doing it right.

There was a mystique about them.

It was all perfect.

There was a lot like X-Men's greatest villains.

There was a mystique about them as well.

Exactly.

The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

I don't even know what you're talking about.

I know what you're talking about.

I know you don't.

So, we need to take a break.

We have- have we covered the first time that we've heard of REM?

No, I think we should start over.

I think we got it.

I think this is a good background.

Yeah, yeah.

But we we both though, by 86 to 87, we're both in.

We're both super fans of REM.

Ready to go.

All right, when we come back, we're going to talk about- we mentioned it a little bit before, but we're going to talk about REM's first Hibtone single.

A few of the early songs we're going to talk about Chronic Town.

They're very first EP release.

This is very exciting.

Very exciting.

We are going to come right back.

This is- are you talking- REM?

RE-ME.

We'll be right back.

Welcome back.

This is- are you talking- REM?

This is Scott.

I've Scott across the table from me.

And this is Scott.

And we've done it.

We certainly have talked genuinely about how we first heard of REM.

Our humble beginnings in the REM.

As far as Adam is concerned, maybe not so humble.

No.

I am the greatest fan.

No, I just mean your beginnings are- What do you mean, like, very privileged?

I know Santa Cruz.

I've been to Santa Cruz.

Oh, really?

So we come to the moment in the show and we've been talking about REM at length, at great length exclusively.

Exclusively and have not been talking about anything else, but it's time for us to go.

And this is a little something we call track by track.

Yeah.

And it's- it's- we just zip right through this part.

Yep, we certainly do.

We're going to basically go through song by song and talk about, I don't know what we like about him, right?

Is that safe to say, Adam?

I mean, yeah.

And we're going to start with those two hip tone songs.

The two hip tone songs.

So this is the very first REM song ever.

This is 1981.

And these two songs, this is the A side and the B side.

These two songs are going to pop up on our next episode in versions that are made maybe slightly more professionally regarded.

Yeah, on Mummer, yeah.

On Mummer.

And this is Radio Free Europe.

This is their first song ever.

Let's hear a little bit.

Here we go.

♪ Time to chill with the break is gonna sing ♪ Just off the strength of this.

People were starting freaking out, like music critics and stuff.

Well, I mean, the world at large too, like, I remember the headlines the next day on the papers.

The front page of the New York Times.

This puts out record world freaking out.

Listen to this.

I know it's great.

♪ This song ♪ I mean, and this, this by the way, could be the chorus of any other song.

The chorus is coming up.

This is like all written.

This is just, and but they pull back.

Oh, they pull back because they don't know.

They know what they're doing.

They're being miserly with that chorus.

Little Ebenezer Scrooge's with the chorus.

This is 21 years old.

They know not to give you that tasty chorus.

A lot of bands, they would, they would.

They would start with the chorus.

Stand in the place where you live.

A lot of bands would do something like that.

Right.

Not REM.

Nope.

Oh, I'm just gonna.

By the way, when stand was, get a life, did it, like, where's your world exploding?

Like mine was?

Two favorite things coming together.

No, I hated that song.

Oh, you did?

Yes.

Everyone kind of did.

I loved it.

Here's the chorus.

Here we go.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, so good.

Man, this is such a great song.

This is, I mean, well, let's talk about, okay, so there's two different versions of the song.

This is the early version.

It's a lot faster.

The first time that you heard it, because I can tell you with certainty, the first time I heard this version.

Really?

It's when eponymous came out.

Oh, eponymous.

Yeah, that's when I heard it.

That's when I heard it.

Yeah, the eponymous was their greatest hits record, and they put this version of Radio Free Europe on, and not the, what I guess a lot of people consider to be the classic version.

The one that's on Marmer.

Yeah, the one that's on Marmer is the one that was played on the radio all the time, and it's the one that everyone kind of knew the sound of.

So this was kind of like almost a rarity to put on the eponymous album in order to attract buyers.

Well, I know having an original Hibtone single of this, the record is the number one, like REM collectibles.

Is it really?

Because they only made a thousand.

Right.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

One K.

I think eponymous came out between document and green after they had left IRS, so I don't think they even wanted eponymous to be there.

No, they actually worked with IRS on eponymous.

The future compilations, they did not want to be a thing, but that one, they were actually, they did not want it to come out, but as long as they were doing it, they decided to work with them and make it a sense.

I'll just agree to disagree on that.

I know that for a fact.

That, but yeah, I think still they did put that on eponymous.

The sitting still was not on eponymous.

The early version of sitting still, that was, I don't know what it's actual CD.

GW was, but I have it on the complete IRS besides.

It's pretty great.

It's pretty great too.

Well, let's talk about Radio Free Europe though, because I don't know what version, maybe we should save this for next time, but I don't know what version I prefer.

I prefer the Hibtone, just because it's kind of due to.

Yeah, it's so- It's so much faster.

Yeah, and it just feels like these guys have two hours to record two songs.

I don't know how quickly they recorded it, but in- 120 minutes.

Sure.

It's just like they are just, they've played this song so many fucking times and have rehearsed it and it's just perfect and it's kind of energy and roughness.

And by the way, this is the REM that we grew up with.

A lot of people know REM.

They probably started to know them around everybody hurts, automatic for the people era.

This is the classic first version of REM where the sound is these jangly arpeggio guitars, Michael Steppend, mumbling his lyrics, and you have Mike Miller with some backups and bass guitar lines that are sort of playing melody in a way.

And then good old Buckbury over there.

Buckbury.

Yeah, you know, Mike Miller's bass lines are very McCartney-esque in the sense that they- I don't know who that is, but- Jonathan McCartney?

Jonathan McArtney?

Oh, interesting.

Okay.

I didn't know I know him.

That's our friend.

Yeah, and he's a terrific singer.

Have you heard him sing?

Yeah, and I didn't know that Mike Miller was basing his guitar lines on his singing.

Everybody knows that.

I didn't know that.

Okay.

Let's hear of the B-side sitting still.

This is- Okay, let's just hear it because- Oh boy.

Here we go.

Here it comes.

Ready?

Yeah.

For the first two songs in a band.

These are stone-cold clasms.

This is a great song.

Enisive commentary.

Let's get to the chorus.

They hold back for the chorus.

I get it.

You see that?

These guys know what they're doing.

I'm going to turn it back up when the chorus comes.

These are two of the best R.E.M. songs ever, in my opinion.

They're amazing.

I don't know where songwriting like that comes from when you're that young and you don't.

It starts with Happy Birthday.

That's one of the first songs you ever hear.

Happy Birthday is a real favorite of yours.

It really is.

It contains it.

That's the best song ever written.

Look, you know, Patty and Mildred had- They knew what they were doing.

They just knew what they were doing.

These guys didn't know what they were doing.

They're now Patty and Mildred.

No.

Here it is.

It's a chorus.

Okay, coming up.

♪ I need you ♪ ♪ I need you ♪ ♪ To me when I get up ♪ It's great.

So good.

So these are the first two songs they put out in 1981.

They put out- The Hibtone is a small independent label.

They put out a thousand of them.

They're snapped up.

Yep.

And then- And by the way, should we talk about the producer, Mitch Easter?

Yeah.

A great guy who is in- And- Let's act- Let's active is his band.

Yeah, and was Don Dixon involved in this or is that murmur when Don Dixon joins?

I don't know.

Okay.

But the Hibtone- I don't think he was.

When the Hibtone single came out, the Village Voice wrote about it.

Get your shit together.

Suddenly, suddenly, these guys are just put out one single.

You are so, by the way, you are so afraid of saying something that does not historically- No, I know that- No, what I mean is to say is this means so much to you that you are choosing your words so carefully because you want to get across how much this means to you.

I know.

No, you're right.

Because I don't want to make a mistake because I didn't do any research before coming in here because I feel like I already know everything.

But now I'm realizing I might have the Hibtone single coming out and murmur coming out mixed up whether it was Village Voice or Rolling Stone because I know Rolling Stone- Okay.

Rolling Stone really liked murmur.

That's what it was.

Yeah, yeah.

I believe that was their number one record or something of the year.

Yes.

So, but I can't remember who really talked about it, but it got good reviews.

That's safe to say.

The Hibtone single.

Yes.

Those- When those reviews came in- Extra, extra, re-all about it.

R-E-M puts out record.

World freaks the fuck out.

R-E-M puts out two songs.

Two songs.

World comes in its pants.

Is that what happens?

Something to that effect, yes.

So they basically put out that record and we're going to make another record for Hibtone.

And then Miles Copeland who ran the IRS label, which by the way, when I was first getting into alternative music, IRS label was- Oh, yeah.

Like that's quality.

They had- They had the police, they have the go-gos, they have R-E-M, they have general public.

Oh, general public, that's right.

I remember I used to erase the L from my general public tape.

So it's a general pubic.

Oh, I thought you meant it to say general public.

And I would go up to people at school and be like, look, it says general pubic now.

By the way, and I want to talk about this, do you remember- And maybe this is just a Southern California thing, but I thought about this and I could not believe that people used to do this and it was fine with everyone.

But they used to get in and out burger stickers and it says in and out on the top line and then burger on the bottom.

And they used to take off the B and the R, so it just says in and out urge.

Oh, yeah.

And that's fine.

And people drive around and the public doesn't say, hey, maybe you shouldn't be doing that.

And it caught on so much.

Hundreds, if not thousands of people do this.

And it's fine.

They're like, hey, isn't it great when you stick a cock in a pussy and you go in or whatever you like to stick it in.

And you go in and out and you have that urge to do it.

The urge to do that.

How insane is that?

Doesn't that sound crazy?

The people would do that.

It's not that people would do that.

It's like I can see one person doing that.

And the fact that it turned into a mini phenomenon.

Even more than the phenomenon, the fact that everyone's just like, yeah.

Oh, yeah, that just was everywhere and everyone responded.

Everyone's like, yeah, yeah.

It's like the Toyota on the back of the trucks where they erase some of the letters, so it just says toy.

Toy.

Well, even, yeah, even your toy.

It's like, okay, you bought it.

But this one is in and out.

It's about fucking.

I know.

It's crazy to me.

I thought about that the other day.

I was like, and I remember when I was a kid, it was like, hey, you know what my brother did?

He did off the B and the R and he and it was like, yeah, that's a good idea.

Yeah, that's clever.

It's really a way to tell everyone you like fucking.

You know, you know what I'm going to do?

What's that now?

I'm going to go and do it on the way home.

I'm going to swing by in and out.

I'm going to grab myself the bumper.

They don't, they don't make them anymore because so many people did it.

They couldn't make them.

That's how crazy this is.

Is that true?

It's true.

It's very true.

And they're very Christian.

Internet.

Yeah, the, but they have John 3 16 or what have you on the bottom of their cups, which is prime place for looking at things.

Oh, yeah.

The bottom of those cups.

I'm always looking there for inspiration.

Oh, oh, it's.

Turns out that Village Voice did alert the public to the stone single.

All right.

Already moved on from that.

A little factoid.

So a year later there, there about two.

Oh, I was going to say the IRS label snaps them up and says, hey, you know, instead of putting it out on the small independent hit zone, why don't you come over here and play with the big boys.

Yeah.

And miles Copeland in the big boys.

Stewart Copeland's brother.

Yep.

They bring over REM and they say, okay, but we want to give you a new producer.

Wait, is that for murmur?

Maybe I'm thinking that's for murmur because.

Yeah, because didn't they want them to for chronic town?

It's still, it's still is Mitch Easter.

Yeah.

Still doing it.

And Don Dixon at this point, right?

I don't know.

That's for you to find out.

Okay.

I have enough trouble.

I'm working the iPod here.

I can't like fact check your bullshit.

Yeah.

Mitch Easter and Don Dixon were a teen.

All right.

And they had an episode of Ghosted right now.

They were like professional musicians and these kids from like lore that ever kids came into record.

He's staying right now.

Record chronic time and murmur and Mitch Easter.

You are having a fucking meltdown right now.

Get your shit together.

Mitch Easter and Don Dixon.

Let's look up their credits.

Okay.

Oh my God.

What's going on?

No, I'm looking.

I'm looking this.

I know.

Okay.

Wow.

Yeah.

Mitch Easter and Don Dixon.

Chex out.

Okay.

Chex out.

So yeah.

So then, so then the next year they're going to put out a record they think they're going to put out an album and IRS says, you know what?

I don't know that you have enough songs to put out a regular album on.

You put out an EP.

Sure.

And so what we have is the Chronic Town EP that came out in 1982.

And for me, this is maybe my favorite REM release.

I don't know.

We're going to go through their records and whenever we get to the last record, we're going to rank our favorites.

And I'll.

Like our favorites so far.

Well, after having listened to them all and talking about them all, we're going to say, okay, now here's after hearing them all, here's our definitive list of what we think.

But for me now, I don't know.

It's either Life's Rich Pageant or this.

They're the ones I listened to the most.

I mean, on my way over here, I was listening to Chronic Town and I was like, this is fucking good rock and roll music.

Like, this is great.

It's, by the way, do you still think that Songs of Experience is a big album?

I know.

I did listen to it.

I usually don't listen to it back, but I did listen to it back.

We both said that many times.

I know.

We were, I believe we were struggling for extra words.

So Chronic Town, yeah, I listened to the shit out of this record.

And the weird part about it to me is that it really wasn't available other than on record.

Oh, yeah.

I didn't, I got this.

It was extra on on a dead letter office.

You don't even know what it was.

Right.

They basically put out this EP and I think it's EP a fun home and it was 12 inch.

I think it wasn't a 10 inch.

I think it was a 12 inch and I have the 12 inch and.

Oh, you had it?

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

I still have it at home.

You do?

Uh huh.

So the original?

Yeah, the original.

You should bring that in.

I will bring it in.

And could you autograph it for me?

Sure.

But I'm going to draw it over the pen.

You're going to draw a big dick on it.

That's right.

The big gargoyle with a big dick.

Yep.

Licking it.

Um, no, I had, I had the record and then when everything segued into CDs about 1987 is when I got my first CD player from my job at the LA Times, I won it as a bonus.

Really?

Um, getting a CD player back then was a big deal.

First CD that I ever bought was a very special Christmas.

Really?

Yep.

I got it at Christmas and that was the big...

Was it like one of those benefit albums where everyone has a...

Yeah, it was the one with Sting and Madonna and Run DMC, like the big classic one.

Joe, with the Keith Herring on the cover?

Yeah, yeah.

Christmas in Hollis, like everything.

It was, it had come out like the day before I got the CD player.

That was the record to get.

Yeah.

But, um, but so then I started transferring everything over to CD and rebying every, every record I had.

The Chronic Town, weirdly enough, they wouldn't put out just a normal CD of it.

Right.

They tacked it on to the end of Dead Letter Office, which was their besides compilation.

Adam, he gets the CD of Dead Letter Office and there's five songs at the end, which are, in my opinion, R.A.M.'s finest songs maybe.

And they're just like an attack on, uh, add on.

It's after their drunken version of King of the Road suddenly this weird, tight, uh, post-punk music starts and you know what the hell was going on.

Yeah, and you're still confused to this day.

Let's listen to a little bit of Wolves Lower, which is the first song on Chronic Town.

This is even a step up from the hip-tone single as far as like, you know, sound quality.

This is just a...

The drums are so loud, I can't turn it up now.

Yeah, it is so catchy.

So incredible.

This, I mean, what's interesting about this song, Wolves Lower, by the way, is that, um, it's Wolves Comma Lower.

Yeah, there's a comma in the middle of the song title, which usually commas comma's comma at the end of sentences, don't they?

Yeah, usually at the end of any proper sentence.

It has a comma.

Four commas.

Right.

Yeah, and from the very start, those harmonies that, uh, that...

Mike Miller.

Mike Miller and...

And, uh, Buckbury.

But no, the, uh, yeah, Buckbury and also Michael Steipan.

So, well, Steipan is not doing harmonies.

He's doing, uh...

Well, he...

He and Mike Mills do harmonize.

Mike Miller does...

Mike Miller.

Yes.

They do harmonize.

And it's very, very, uh, hairs here, or the atom.

Let's split the atom on that one.

How about it?

Uh, but from the very beginning there, very beautiful harmonies.

Harmonies and the w... the odd thing about the, this song is that it was a late addition to the record.

Oh, was it?

They, uh, had ages of you in there, which was a song we played a little earlier.

You told me that and I didn't know that.

It's crazy.

It was...

They had that and, and, uh, I believe IRS maybe said, you know what?

We don't think this gets the record on the right foot.

Um, let's do a new song.

And then, like, this is what they put on, which is one of the best REM songs ever.

But I...

Our ages of you is one of my favorites.

What version of ages of you were they gonna put?

It's one that we have not heard.

They've never put it out.

We've never, yeah, we've never heard it.

That's weird.

I don't know.

They've put everything out.

I would love to hear it.

The ages of you that's on Dead Letter Off is...

They rerecorded, yeah.

Pretty rough years later.

It's great.

And then I have a ton of live versions of it, but I've never heard of it.

But they've never, yeah, they've never put out the version that they were talking about.

Oh, I wanna hear that.

I wanna hear it too.

I wanna hear it.

So then, um, that's the first song and then you have...

I mean, we...

Those first two songs that they put out the A side and the B side, Radio Free Europe and Sitting Still, two of the greatest.

But then here's this...

Maybe...

I don't know.

If you were to say best R.A.M. song of all time, this is maybe one of, I don't know, this is gardening at night.

Oh, yeah.

Second song on this EP.

I'm gonna hear it.

I like how almost all of their songs have a part where...

Buckberry can just like a...

His fills are my favorite.

Now remember...

I like McGraw.

I remember when Guns N' Roses got big like an 87 and Steven Adler's fills, I thought we're ripping off Buckberry's fills.

Really?

Yeah, that's interesting.

There are a lot of fills on appetite for destruction that I think.

Oh, shut up.

Fuck you, man.

Seriously, fuck you.

Ah, man, I love this song.

Yeah, it's a great song.

Although I will say that the other vocal mix might make for...

Let's talk about that because there is a different version of it and that can be found on eponymous.

Exactly the same.

Same backing track, but there is a different vocal.

Now to me the vocal sounds a little more out front maybe, a little more legible or...

Well, it's not in falsetto.

It's just kind of sung in the usual stipend way.

And it seemed to me like it was, first of all, it's a rarity to get people to buy it.

But it also maybe was like, hey, everyone likes the one I love where the vocals are a little more out in front and center.

Why don't we have this other version of it where it's...

It was just maybe...

I mean, I would imagine they had those two versions and just decided to put that one on there.

Yeah, maybe.

You don't know what the hell you're talking about.

But I will say the cool thing about eponymous was that they put those two kind of different versions on and then also the South Central Rain that they put on there was the one from the music video, which is a different version.

So they did put out a best of but it had different things on it.

So not really the best of.

No.

It was like the best of some songs.

The best of...

And then they also put romance on it, which...

Yeah.

What movie was that from?

I can't remember, but we'll talk about when it comes up.

Okay, so track number three on Chronic Town is Carnival of Swords, parentheses, box cars.

This is my favorite on this.

This is your favorite.

Oh, wow.

This is great.

Starts off with this kooky kaleidoscope.

It's like, what am I listening to?

Kiss, psycho circus?

Is this my at the circus?

What's going on?

Oh, wait a second.

This is great.

Jesus Christ.

I'm going to blow my fucking brains out.

This is so good.

I'm going to blow my brains out.

Yeah.

So this is sort of the classic REM sound.

Wait, wait a second.

Here it comes.

Right here.

Yeah.

That's it.

This is the classic REM sound to me.

The fast drumming with these great fills.

The harmonies, the arpeggios, the just catchy, catchy melodies.

And you can't really, you don't know what they're talking about.

You don't know what they're saying.

That's the other thing is like when I would sing along, I'd be like box cars.

And that's what you do.

That's what you do.

Okay.

So that's the first side of the EP.

Yeah.

Okay.

So it was three songs on the first three on the second.

Two on the second.

Yeah.

And the last song stumble is long.

It's like a five minute song or something.

Okay.

So it was like a 22, 23 minute or so.

The first song on side two is, this is a million.

And it sounds like a million bucks, buckberries rather.

This is one million.

Did they play any of this when you saw them the one time you saw them?

I'd have to go look at the track list if it's online somewhere.

It is.

I can't believe you only saw them once.

I mean, by that point where you kind of, I was on my way, I peeked maybe with them.

I'm not sure.

We'll talk about it in future episodes.

So this is, I mean, this is obviously versus our great.

Wow.

This is a good sound.

But then when they get to these choruses, oh my goodness.

Here we go.

Yeah.

They just had a next.

I wonder what, I mean, I guess, would Michael stipend, I wonder if he would make the melodies later or, you know, they would just jam and he would sing over it.

I'm really interested with these, with these types of catchy pop songs, you know, like later when they get experimental, I'm sure they're just like putting chords together and he's, you know, doing what Bono does, which is sort of just humming over it and figuring it out later or whatever.

But with these types of catchy, you know, pop songs, I wonder how they do it.

I know usually they would just record the songs and give him tapes of it and he would just drive around and think of melodies and lyrics.

So sort of like what you would do when you were driving your mom around.

Yeah.

And actually the same process, Michael Steppen would come to Santa Cruz and drive my mom around and think of Blaerts.

Where would it take her?

And grocery store, the park.

Why doesn't she driving herself?

Your mom sounds lazy.

No, she's very, very, very lazy.

No, she actually prefers to walk around, but, you know, sometimes she likes to drive just because she enjoys vehicles.

Should her run?

Yeah, she's a jogger.

Really?

Yeah.

How fast she go?

20, 30,000 miles every 15, 20 minutes.

That's not bad.

Thank you.

It's not bad.

She could keep up with me.

Let's just say.

Oh, really?

What are you, a cheetah?

I'm a Puma.

Oh, fuckers.

Okay.

Now last song of the EP and last song on Side 2 is Stumble.

Yeah.

Well, I've been listening to this a lot over the past couple of days.

And each time I go, you know what?

That's the only stumble for me trying to be clever of like, this is the song that I technically don't like as much as the first four.

It's not as good.

But only because those first four are stone cold classics.

Yep.

Because then each time I would go, let me hear it one more time just so I can solidify my opinion that stumble isn't as good.

It still is really good.

Yeah.

I mean, but it's not.

It's not.

And like you said, it's longer too, which is teeth.

Yeah.

Plus it's got a guy going too at the beginning.

And he says teeth.

He says teeth.

He's pointing at his teeth.

No, he's knocking his teeth over his finger.

You can hear it.

Huh, interesting.

Does that's what these, it sounds like drums, but he's just banging on his teeth?

No, he literally is going like this.

But the doo doo doo doo doo.

That's also teeth.

No, I like this song actually.

This is great.

But you're right.

It's not the...

It's like if the others are 100s, this is like a...

Like 85.

I would even say 90.

Once it gets going by the chorus, it's like...

But it's not a...

It's not like some of the songs that we've heard before or further songs in our can.

No, this is great.

I mean, listen to this.

It's so good.

It's been great.

Yeah.

This is awesome.

These guys...

Yeah, I like this song.

That's where it comes in.

It's like, oh wow, this is good.

I have no clue what they're talking about.

Far in chance?

I don't know.

Yeah.

I don't know.

Are there lyrics online for these songs?

Yeah, there are.

There are.

I think even the REM website might...

I don't know about this stuff.

That's why...

I mean, but it was not available when these came out.

So there's no way...

Actually, when they started printing lyrics with their albums, I was a little bummed out just because that was one of the cool things that they never did do that.

Eventually, they did.

Well, that's chronic town.

As far as I'm concerned, one of their best releases.

Yeah, it's incredible.

And what's weird about it is with Radio Free Europe and Sitting Still, they rerecorded those to put them on a regular album.

But these five songs never recorded them again, never put them on an album.

It just lives on chronic town.

But it was an IRS release.

So it was distributed more widely than the hip tone.

Sure, it was.

But I mean, once CD started coming out, it was an afterthought.

And it was not even on iTunes until maybe three years ago or something.

It's not right.

Yeah.

I didn't know that.

I think it's one of their classic songs and the others are classics too as far as I'm concerned.

But it's one of these strange classics that is a little harder to come by or at least was.

But for me, I, Life's Rich Pageant and Chronic Town were the two that I listened to over and over and over and over.

So for me...

That's cool.

Yeah.

I mean, I listened to Chronic Town by proxy just because it was on dead letter office.

And I would, I got to know it really well, but I didn't know that it was them from several years ago or whatever.

I just, I didn't know.

I mean, you were stupid.

It's just a stupid, stupid boy.

I mean, look, you had the mental capacity of a two month old.

Yeah.

I mean, listen, I'll be honest, I'm no genius now.

I mean, honestly, sometimes you don't know, you're saying googoo, you don't know if you should follow it up with gaga or bledbud or...

You just don't know.

Yeah.

I mean, listen, never going to claim to be a, be a, an A plus student.

Sure.

An A student?

Yes.

Yeah, but no, A plus.

But plus is it's like, come on, you know, and those A plus students, by the way, they're ruining the curve.

Get out of town.

Get the fuck out of town.

Hey!

Get the fuck out of town.

Look at my...

Do you think we should wrap it up?

Yeah.

I mean, what else do we...

Is there any...

That's it.

There was, we played a little bit of white tornado, which was written in, and on the B sides at the same time, that was our intro to...

What was that on the B side of?

You know what?

It was not...

I don't believe it was really released.

It's just on the complete B side.

It was on the other office and stuff, right?

Oh, yeah, yeah.

So, but it was not...

I don't think it was put out.

I don't think it was a B side of anything.

But it was recorded.

It was recorded around...

And all the right friends which you played...

All the right friends is around, recorded around the same time.

Yeah, and maybe more of a live track at the time.

You pointed out that they didn't really get around to recording that till maybe later, but it was around this time.

They had it...

It's one of their first songs.

They...

Obviously, they were playing live shows and they couldn't just play seven songs.

Yeah.

So they had a lot of songs.

You played a lot of covers in those days, too.

Yeah.

You hear them playing songs that will wind up on records five years in the future.

Just a touch was one of those early songs and that winded up on Life's Rich Patch.

Life's Rich Patch and of course.

And then a lot of times you'll be listening to a murmur concert and you'll hear reckoning songs and I'm sure vice versa.

You know, there is a version of gardening at night.

I wanted to play you.

Okay.

That all wound up...

Yeah.

You have it on your phone?

Yeah.

Give me that fucking thing.

I don't care.

I don't care when I get tricked.

This is a version of what?

Gardening at night.

Is this the different vocal version or is this the acoustic version or...?

No, this is a different version altogether that I hadn't heard.

This is a different version.

Oh, I thought you were saying altogether.

That's an airplane joke.

I've never heard this.

What is this?

This is a different version of gardening at night.

I know, but I'm just...

Oh, god.

It came out in 2006, but it's...

It's...

Oh, I thought it was over.

That was really different.

A little slow.

Well, yeah, it's a slower version.

As far as I'm concerned, if you're going to make a different version, you've got to make it exactly the same tempo.

You've heard the acoustic version, right?

The complete iris B-sides, I'm sure.

It also was a bonus track on the letter office when they put out an expanded version of the album.

Yeah.

And here's an early just-attached.

Yeah.

So these are all the songs that are playing that they're writing around this time.

Oh, this isn't...

This is actually not that early, but just a touch is a very old song.

Yes.

Good for you.

All right.

You too.

All right.

We're going to wrap it up, but there is plenty more where this came from.

We're going to...

Look, I mean, Adam, we're committed to doing this, right?

Look, we're embarking on an all-new adventure.

Oh, my gosh.

And I'm excited because this is...

There's an endless well of great music here that I'm excited to talk about.

And there's a lot of really funny...

Yeah.

Things that we're going to say?

Oh, man, we're going to say so many funny things.

So they don't even know where to start.

We're going to do this as long as we can.

We have a little bit of time over the next few weeks to record some of these.

Yeah, yeah.

We're looking forward to doing this.

Absolutely.

So, I'm going to pull this back so you can't trick me and I got it and...

Oh, fuck.

Why did I not do that?

Because I fucked you.

All right.

Here we go.

This is the end.

A lot of bad language today on the podcast.

Are you sensitive about the bad language?

You know, I know language.

R-E-M might be...

Well, language to me, it's like one of the only words.

Anyway, we'll see you next time on R-U talking.

R-E-M-R-E-M-R-E-M-E.

Where we hope that you found what you're looking for.

Until we think of something to say goodbye with.

Bye.
