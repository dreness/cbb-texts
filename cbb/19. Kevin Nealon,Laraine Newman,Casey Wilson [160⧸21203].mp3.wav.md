go John Belushi Chris Farley and Gilda Radner now we have it is my pleasure to welcome my guests I'll go from left to right and maybe the person in the middle will get back by the time I introduce her all right on my left we have someone from the first of all let me just say that we're spanning all four decades of the show today we have someone from the 70s someone from the 80s and 90s and someone from the 2000s and the person on my media right is from the 2000s she was on the show from 2008 to 2009 I believe my time on the show has come to a close it's come to a close she's one of the funniest people I've ever known Casey Wilson how are you how are you thanks for having a fantastic go Casey all right person in the middle is not back so let me move to my right I think I said immediate right before but that's you're actually on my immediate left no one cares but okay come on now this is important I'm painting a picture we could fix that in post are you willing to work post on this show by the way you're lying out okay you did say left though oh I did okay so on my immediate right we have someone who's tenure on the show was from about 86 to 90 sounding more and more like NPR today sorry no Kevin Nealon yeah sit down please sit down sit down no one standing put down the gun I was out from 86 to 95 okay don't brag you know that's just that's not bragging that's not bragging that is uh that's fact someone call facts bragging you know like some new says facts all the time in a bragging way would some would say that's bragging and almost seems like the people that were on that show for only a year have done a lot better in life you know and their career okay Scott why are you laughing I think he's trying to extend a kind word uh in olive branch if you will no no I mean they're no I'm just a fact there have been some other fact I'll take it thank you there have been some people who have only been on that show for a year or even less than a year who do yeah Sarah Stu Leonard uh Chris binder oh don't forget Monica Marathi Monica Marathi 11 Elizabeth Tanders Elizabeth T anders all doing great now Elizabeth has an act that's traveling around right now in which she does all of Victoria Jackson's characters really it's yeah but none of the ones that she did on us and now the one she's done since then yeah yeah yeah yeah the classic Victoria Jackson sketches Jean Charlotte Jean Charlotte he was a lot of people don't realize he was a cast member on the morning show from a piece of wit yeah yeah so nothing to uh poo poo about and uh I believe our third guest is coming into the room right now she was uh one of the original cast members wash your hands I was lost I was loved out oh it was bad never by your mental state uh she was one of the original cast members from 1975 to 1980 this is Lorraine Newman how are you a legend by the way I think that was really the only saturday night live you know I mean they kept the name but the show never stayed the same you know that was really the saturday night live as far as I'm concerned as far as I'm concerned uh 1980 to 1981 that was the real strategy I love the cast I love the current cast yeah I love it I think it's great she just gave me an encouraging pat really no I watch it they are great we watch it every week when it's on and we really love it who is we paint a picture for us when you say we do you have friends over the crackling fireplace the two dogs the husband and the two kids oh yes you stay up until 10 o'clock in the morning when you watch the two vote that's right exact how did you know because I know you have kids and you can't stay up possibly yes I can't say I have a half hour pass they go to bed no way so uh you all have three very different experiences on the show I mean you're in in very different decades but let's talk a little bit about how you got the show because I would imagine that it's very different for all of you um all of you auditioned I think Lorraine did you even auditioned no just Lauren Michaels knew you I knew Lauren was on michaels yeah well I certainly don't know anymore I did I did we are okay okay um jakey rallying I we were in the ground lings we we were doing our show now you were one of the original members of the groundlings which how does I mean it's not like you found it and said okay we're gonna have we already have this theater we have we're gonna have classes it just was like it was an improv workshop it was offshoot of the committee and we had really improbable people in it like Tim Matheson and Pat marita and it was weird uh valerie curtain and uh of course paul rubens was one of your after my time oh gee shallot gee shallot and phil harpman was kind of hanging around he was still like what it's not the same name I had from before but oh uh he was still working as a graphic artist he he wasn't in the show yet really I didn't know he was a graphic artist yeah yeah he was a phil harpman oh phil harpman yeah he was a good he was a good artist he just he used to actually he did excuse me lain i'll take it from here uh take a kelman no uh phil he actually did some of the uh Crosby stills and Nash logos for their albums really yeah he did the alvever for poco yeah he's great creator oh wow but um and then one day we we were at the oxford theater which I I don't even know the name of it now we decided we're gonna be a work company yes and I was actually the only one that voted against the groundlings because I thought it made us sound like a bunch of hippies oh are you part of hippie? well I was but I just thought we'd outgrow that name right self-loathing hippie yeah there you go you knew the hippie movement was great though you got my number anyway uh lorn uh was producing a lily tomlin special and they needed guys for the show and they came to see our show and I was doing the valley girl right and so the classic s&l character i'm groundlings kirt right and they hired me for one line which was very thrilling I was 22 and then on set they gave me a monologue which is very exciting and then lorn came back uh because he was gonna do s&l and I didn't know he was in the audience and it's better that way sometimes it would believe me it is right and he hired me from that he had me come over the chateau marmont where he was living of course and said lory and I wanted to a show that's a cross between 60 minutes and monty python and I you know nodded my head vigorously having never heard of monty python oh really yeah oh funny saying i'd watch that where the repeat's not on pbs at the time or you just haven 't gotten caught up with it oh wow because you're too busy being a hippie um did you go to woodstock? I know he's too young I think I was like 14 or 15 and I could have gone I would love them he's coast oh really did you hear about it yeah but I thought it was I thought it was the bird from charlie ron you're right so you want to hang around that thing you know um kevin how did you uh okay here's how i imagine you got on the show because you were a stand up you weren't necessarily a sketch player right right i was a stand up did did lorn come to see you at the improv or something well no what happened was you could not get an audition for silent life if you were in l seanville so unless you had a high-powered agent or somebody with connections and um and you had one that i did not have no but i lived in a house um i was actually dating jan hooks at the time and she was up for the show it was the summer of uh eighty six more we'll be right there and um and dana carvey rented a room above the garage in this house in the hollywood hills that we lived out when he came down from san francisco he would stay there and you knew i knew him stand up yeah and we used to run around the hollywood reservoir once in a while um chasing but nothing sexual nothing sexual so i was in i was reading backstage live s ary life you know the book about laren and everybody else right and kind of living by cariously through them and i'm happy for them and never ever thinking because i was not a sketch player i didn't do characters you know i was i was stand up okay um so um dana called me once uh i think uh from l orn's house and uh said you're not gonna believe this i'm in the back room and uh palma kartney's out in the kitchen with uh chevy chase or somebody else and uh i told him about you because looking for one more guy and uh and they may want to see your tapes i thought oh okay really palma k artney's out there now did palma kartney want to see your tapes did you ever figure that well no not really no but um what a pal so uh yeah really real pal but i think he probably uh recommended a few other people too oh i'm guessing but they said they needed a tall comic because of like a chevy chase come guy so anyway uh i thought that'll never happen because you know i don't do characters i'm not sketch guy and nothing ever goes well free in this business right right so uh uh he calls me she says they're hey i'm out at lorn's again um damn act right's out in the kitchen and uh steve martin and i'm thinking boy lorn really gets good good workers to work in this kitchen you know you must ring those stars doing some routing they want to see your tapes they want to see your tapes so i said okay i'll send them never think anything would come of it and then he calls me again hey i'm at lorsey sotamu's saying's in the kitchen that's all lord is dead lord's dead they like your tapes i think they'd fly in so i thought no that'll never happen but then it did happen and um they flew me and i thought you know it would just be me maybe just flying me and of course everybody on a plane was going in for an audition even the pilot comes out of the cockpit with an arrow is this funny you guys think this is funny so i get there and you know you go to studio eight h and uh i remember auditioning on the floor uh just by the bleachers the end of the ble achers the end of the camera set up and lorn was sitting there with everybody that was still on the cast like nora done and uh dennis miller and dana was there jenn hadn't been hasn't gotten on the show yet and um and i did my little stand up and a few things that dana and i used to do you know in the driveway together just kind of kidding around and left never thinking i would get the show and then a week later um uh he meets with me and my manager at the time was brad gray who also represented lorn michael said you know at the time um he wasn't actually my manager i wanted him to be my manager and when this finally came around i think he was interested in being my manager i wonder why so he agreed to uh help me seal the deal so lorn said we'd love to have you on the show as a feature player uh and as a writer and uh and then he excused himself to go to the bathroom after talking for like an hour and uh and when he left he went dollar ninety eight and when he left now i'm thinking in hindsight this is a setup you know always leave the room let the manager discuss it with the client and then come back and when he left uh brad said uh uh to tell him um let's just tell him you'll think about it over the weekend and uh you know we'll have no money i'm thinking what are you crazy yeah and so he came back you know and it was kind of like being punked i guess he came back well what do you think i said well you know let me think about it over the weekend you know it was all right well you think about it over the weekend and we'll see you in New York on monday so that was that amazing now kasey you uh aud itions okay now you and i were working on a pilot for fox together i remember uh i believe i remember that yeah and uh that was a late night pilot you were a cast member on it and then we didn't get picked up i think in december and seemingly within like a week or something it seemed like you were on the show yeah i auditioned during the writer's strike and um you know flew out there and auditioned and then a couple months went by or maybe a month or so and i met laurin at the polo lounge the Beverly Hills he loves to hang around to all the hollywood hotels yeah he loves them and um i had ordered a really large soup because i was waiting for him for a couple hours and of course it arrived right when he sat down so we kind of squashed together in a small booth and i'm hunched over the soup because we're just not eat it and then um you know he didn't talk about the show for about an hour and then right before i left i thought this is it i mean i've completely blown this i've done nothing but eat soup and how did you arrive at having a meeting with him i arrived at it uh i went to NYU and from there did a two-woman comedy show with june rayfield yes very funny thanks and uh we did our comedy show at aspen comedy arts festival and then tried to get our mugs out there but no one wanted them they 're like you guys are writers and so and not mug makers because you had a uh i did it was a brief brief yeah i had renaissance festivals yeah renaissance insults next to my mind boos yeah glaurin at a very profitable mind it um yeah and so i did a two-woman show and then finally um sent my tape in and i don't know they someone thought and what do you talk about with laura michaels for an hour without talking about the show well on michaels oh no i mean that made in a good way you know he's got amazing stories and and anyway i thought you know this is it i've completely blown this i he said i already auditioned so i didn't know what this was right and finally you'd already done like a live audition yeah i've fallen out there and done um a full audition and then he said you know he pointed to some a booth in the corner and he said you know i thought it'd be nice to bring you here because uh this is where i was brought in 19 i don't even know yeah and he said and i you know was asked if i thought i could handle the job of running this this show and um so i i'd also like to extend you the offer would you like to come out to new york wow and so i cried of course and i hit him and cried and i know the story is seeming strange on the heels of my most recent news but no matter what no matter what it's come so circle yeah i spent to this morning in that same booth crying no no no no you go back there just to talk about that a lot i'm just trying to get some closure no no no um so he had seen you in aspen no i think he just saw my tape and then i flew up but someone from s&l saw our show and um so that's i mean that 's a fantastic story and a great show biz moment for you it was and we've talked about this no matter what happens to you on the show you at least always achieved getting on the show yeah you did always get you know what i mean like you're you're always yeah in some sense that's the highest moment of it yeah like i said there are a lot of people in it that only stayed for a year and didn 't work very well sir silverman been stiller j-moor dame and way j-moor dame and way rob riggle even i mean vid she thinks uh comings rob riggle i think it's still weller bill mac and tourniqu et hamillage shatner yeah she's um wait she we all know she's related to it wait she was she was found floating in the pool i believe that's a sadder tale all right we're gonna do a song uh oh i haven't prepared anything oh okay what is a song we're doing we're gonna uh all hour i'm gonna be playing uh songs by saturday night live cast members so uh we're gonna start off with uh a softball this is the lonely island like a boss we'll be right back with kasey wilson l oreyn newman kevin newland on any one of three one comedy death rate mr samburg thanks for coming to your performance review no problem so you're in charge around here is that fair to say absolutely i'm the boss okay so take us through a day in the life of the boss well the first thing i do is talk to corporate approved memos okay well this has been eye opening for me i'm the boss yeah no i got that you said it about 400 times i'm the boss yeah yeah i got it i'm the boss so i heard you see you later like a mouse indie one oh three one comedy death ray i'm here with my guest kasey wilson loreyn newman kevin newman kevin you have a new stand-up show special i guess that's what i do i do it's tonight premiere tonight which uh tonight we mean friday uh friday september four on showtime i think it's at nine thirty it's called now hear me out now how did you come up with that title well that is based on one of the jokes i do and i've done several what joke would that be what's here uh it's how people say now hear me out and usually you don't want to um hear them out because it's the ending is not too good you know hear me out yeah you know that going in yeah i'm gonna put this noose around your neck no no no hear me out yeah it's spawned by the worst case scenario yeah and then the two other titles actually did a poll on twitter and uh my um twitter ads had decided now hear me out was the best uh the two runner-ups were um shut that party down and uh what about me are those based on jokes as well all based on jokes one one it's based on a hunk the uh shut that party down and the other one's based on a joke uh a joke yeah based on a joke a Chinese joke yeah um and uh it's premieres tonight but it 'll be playing all throughout the week i would have been probably playing for a while and then you know what's gone we're gonna put it right to dvd it's gonna go right to dvd you're kidding right away it's not going to go right to dvd you don't need no stinking theater now usually a direct route what would the economy no you go right have you thought about just doing like uh you know almost like what Jim Cameron did with avatar day just like you know premiering it and i'm acts across the country showing 20 minutes of it just uh i didn't know what avatar was for i started hearing avatar and think oh there must be something with the internet you know and i guess what is it a movie it is a movie yes uh it's 3d it's a three-dimensional movie uh coming out in december i believe i saw 20 minutes i will be going to dvd i don't think so i think really you're the only yeah yeah yeah so anyway it's the first um um one hour stand-up special i've ever done i've been doing stand- up comedy for like well for our years you know i i hate to say that you just kind of like seem to mumble there for a second no i started back in 19 and now then you just seem to mumble and then throw up i'm not sure what's going on the people they go you know this is back in 19 per foronara but um he's very sensitive about his age and he's a man oh no no i'm i'll tell you how old i am i'm 27 right that doesn't seem possible but anyway i've been doing stand-up for 30 years and it was does anybody care nobody cares i've been doing stand-up for 30 years and it was time for me to do a special it seems even though it's not that special it seems to me like you would have been approached so many times i mean approached mostly by prostitutes and they're not good producers but they had such good sense of humor yes i think you should take your clothes off well how is that funny how is that gonna work for you down in your knees i can't reach the mic by that if i'm down my knees uh but no nobody uh has really approached me i mean there's so many comics out there now and everybody's doing specials and that's why i'm not calling this one really a special what do you call it's um it's just another one Kevin Nealon has another one yeah and uh is it all uh material you've been doing recently or is it a combination of holes it's everybody's material oh good you know why i always know it's it's uh pretty much new material but when i started doing stand-up comedy it was so difficult to come up with good jokes and i would see established comics you know doing like 20 minutes half hour right i thought to myself why couldn't they just give me one of their jokes each you know that way i would have 20 like 20 minutes of good material i wouldn't have to be did you ever approach them about that um no no no i because i knew i knew it i knew it was you know it was a pipe treatment yeah comics are very possessive uh isn't that horrible when you take the jokes they want it back hey that's my joke i said i'm just using it i'm not keeping it yeah i'm borrowing it yeah now laren uh we were talking about my case he mentioned mimes which i thought was uh ironic because you studied with Marcel Marceau is that i did yes i saw him at rois hall when i was about 15 and i was just staggered because i had never seen anybody who could get laughs without words i was just it transpired and i i don't know where i got the balls to do this but i went backstage and i asked him if there was somebody in la i could study with he gave me the name of a teacher with richmond shepherd and i started studying with him and i was also taught improv at the time so i was learning improv since i was 15 not that i was ever good at it um yes and so then i ended up studying with him when i graduated high school because i was just knew that are you all right now the mic almost kills mic yeah i'm trying to swallow it he's just so ambitious and um uh so i i would lived in paris for a year and study mime with Marcel Marceau when you were 18 you lived in paris for a year wow now okay let me ask this how do you get backstage at rois hall first of all that you ask him not sure where it is and what did he sound like well he has his very high pitched voice like this oh no wonder yeah now i get it now i get it now i see new read the voice one has to wonder you go to paris when you're 18 to study with Marcel Marceau well actually here's what happened okay let's get the real story i audition for four acting schools royal academy of dramatic art Bristol ole vik London academy and i can't remember the fourth one they have preliminary aud itions where they auditioned 300 people out of that they take 80 people i made the 80 group for all four schools and had to do the final audition in england i was rejected by all four schools so i was sob bing on the phone to my parents and my mother said well honey why don't you go over to paris and see if Marcel Marceau's school is is gonna you know maybe you could do that you know and i thought all right you know hoping like hell that that wasn't gonna happen because i just didn't have the balls to really right it's the second time i've referred to myself not having balls yeah okay um noted and you know just didn't think that i could live in paris by you know at that age without balls but without balls but i grew a pair and i ended up living there but they are french balls yeah they are french ones and they proceeded back into me so you're i mean i've never heard of a mom like that who's so supportive that she didn't want me to come home oh really i'm kidding yeah you grew up here in california and you went to you went to Beverly Hills high is that all right so did you have like artsy parents is that no my dad was a quilt manufacturer my mom was uh she did a lot of things including building the westwood playhouse which is now the gefen really she built it yeah in what way she she financed it being built oh wow right who did you go to Beverly Hills high with anybody notable um well let's see i'm class of 70 um well i know joann hall who's now joann eglison she was four years ahead of me three years ahead of me rottweiser no they're older than me i know but didn't they go to Beverly they did yeah they did and so when you're going there you kind of heard about them sure well okay you want some six degrees of uh yes kevin bakin okay have your show of shows all right of your show of shows uh okay karl riner mel tolkin yes great writer mel brooks okay karl has a son rob riner mel tolkin has two sons steven and michael tolkin um mel brooks to my knowledge has no children rob riner's best friend albert brooks um my best friend in high school steven tolkin my daughter 's best friend in high school lee harvios wall i've got jake riner jake riner oh wow jake riner oh wow so haleena my daughter lina is skateboarding in handcock park which is you know miles from where we are on a random street she meets a girl on the street who's also skateboarding they become friends and a tolkin wow i mean of all the gin joints right it's just so weird and had you had you guys kept in touch and like hey our kids should hang out together or was it just kind of a random chance they became friends they just became friends and and you know jake jake riner and lina are to this day we're all through they went to school together jake and lina went to school together and um rob riner became good friends with uh jim brooks and his son joey and jake are good friends wow amazing and your mother she um worked for living or she was an architect and she did a lot of things she decorated she did a lot of stuff so she um did she did she do the design for the uh gefam thing she just financed it meaning she contacted investors and come put it together or what her own architectural money how much did that cost at the time and how mad was your father it was about five hundred he was a little mad yeah it's a little very long uh kasey do you have anything to do with the gefen play house or the sunshine back little yes and no uh kasey you have a movie coming out i went to the not coming out you're about to film it what's the status with it i went to the reading last night let me just say it's it's a movie with the aforementioned june raffiel and uh you had a script reading for investors i would imagine or for the producers and it was so great it is so and you're actually filming it right when when you film it's called um ask backwards and it's um a road trip comedy thanks uh where june and i play best friends that are really delusional we think we're these kind of great awesome women but she's an egg donor and yeah and i work in like a box at the standard hotel where i just sit there and make people stare at me but we think that we're you know successful business woman i'm a high-fart singer and it's just about codependent friends yeah it's so funny it you know and it's really refreshing hearing it because it's first of all it is a broad comedy starring two women which you don't see a lot of and it's like a buddy comedy yeah starring two women but aside from that like the point of view that you guys had as the writers of it is so refreshing because you guys are talking about things that you don't really hear in any kind of other broad comedy like you're talking about you know your character is kind of a hoarder and um you know you guys are kind of talking about you know uh a really specific characters that you don't get to hear in any movies yeah these days it's really fantastic i mean we we wrote bride wars before this and i think the experience of that was it was great to write kind of a commercial comedy but now we wanted to do something with a little more of a specific little more of your sense yeah our sensibility and and also just make you know movies where women are the comedic focal points yeah it's kind of our it's fantastic i love it it does it all seems kind of ass backwards to me if you're okay but a good title it's like 100 ass backwards no that's a great title to get our title did you get it off the twitter yeah ass front words twitter tip you weren't gonna call it twitter for a while it was so confusing for a long time all right let's go to another song this is uh sera silverman this

that that was part of it so that's sad i thought you were kidding this has become uh very popular segments maybe the only segment i've even come up with but uh it is the most popular this is called would you rather theme song still on all right it's time to play would you rather uh i uh let me explain this for our guests and for a few of the listeners um this is basically just like the game that you play with your friends or in the schoolyard where i have i give you two options i say which one would you rather i will say the question oh i should mention that uh every week i ask for would you rather is on my twitter account and uh some of my uh twitter buddies send me them and they 're all very funny and i got quite a few of them and uh i will say the choice and then i will open up the floor for questions don't vote right away i will open the floor up for questions and then you ask me questions about the specifics of each instance uh so if uh you you have a question about any of the particulars i will be able to answer them and then i will close the floor and uh then we will vote and that is how you play would you rather so uh well let's start off with an easy one this is from mel got served mel got served would you rather for one year eat peanut butter and jelly on white bread or eat peanut butter and jelly on three inch floppy disks and she adds the floppy disks have zero calories all right i am opening the floor for questions anyone have a question is the peanut butter high high calories that is a great question see this is textbook would you rather i love the casey you're coming in right off the bat you're coming in strong you have a great point of view is he angry even though you is it is it's much smoother chunky now see kevin this is not how you play with the father and would this be the exclusively the only thing you eat or would it be one meal see now what i'm going to have to ask is that we ask one question at a time i've not answered uh kasey's questions so so uh that's okay we'll iron out the kinks on this uh as we go how many are we gonna do all right so first of all kasey you have the question which is is the peanut butter high caloric yes the peanut butter is very high caloric and one teaspoon of the peanut butter is 100 calories oh thank you all right so uh now uh uh who else had a question over here white bread has no fiber do floppy disks have fiber that is a great question that is exactly how you play would you rather now uh where are they getting these floppy disks from now kevin i have to again is it staples man i have to again ask you not to jump in with questions until i've answered the previous question okay we'll work this out we'll iron out the kinks uh so what was your question the rain well you know there's no fiber and white bread there is no fiber and white bread correct but do floppy disks have fiber yes in this particular universe the floppy disks have a lot of fiber and actually one and a half times the daily recommended allowance of fiber great question great question now i'm going to move on to kevin did did do you have a question i have no questions you're on it i risk my case no further questions all right we're about to shut down the doors on the questions and questions are gone now i've closed the floor floor for questions we're going to vote now i'm going to start on my immediate left kc would you rather eat peanut butter and jelly on white bread for one year or on three inch floppy disks three inch floppy disks and why is that because white bread is the devil i mean in a sense you know i'm trying to lay off the shug the shug oh because white bread has a lot of uh the carbs and yeah you're not listening to early death row hits either because that has too much shug night i'll explain that a little bit uh no we're not with it yeah i think we're all we've heard enough let's move on to the middle uh the rain newman how vote ye i i'm gonna have to say white bread and the reason is that floppy disks are obsolete and they're obsolete for a reason good answer good answer kevin niele and well scott i've eaten floppy disks before and they do not digest well um they do not break apart well um if you ever try to break a floppy disk oh no i have no i have no it's very difficult to chew so i would i'm with the rain i'll go with the white bread and uh peanut butter uh smooth along the top smooth along the top i would like to crust off of the white bread is okay we can do that for you no problem all right see that's how you play do you know that um this was a bit that got me on the tonight show really and 1984 yeah which bit would you rather oh it is yeah yeah and i did it a few times on there and i it was got it really got really uh edgy though really oh yeah well yeah because it couldn't help be edgy with you kevin how how would how would you i should have patented it how would you do it then they did come up with the game how would you actually do it on the show i mean as part of i said you know what i have i have a lot of difficulty making choices in life i don't know about you guys you know what i mean and then i start off like would you rather a headache or a stomach ache or no would you rather have soup or salad and the answer goes soup i go yeah me too me too and say uh but i mean some choices are hard you know i'm trying to prove my point like okay let's say would you rather have a headache or a stomach ac he headache yeah me too me too no but but there are some choices like would you rather get your fingers slammed in a car door and then have the guy drive away through a car wash or would you rather be buried up to your neck and dirt and then have somebody paint your head like a soccer ball and they would go uh car door yeah me too because you know it might be some Brazilian kids hanging around you know it was a soccer ball but anyway yeah so johnny kurtson loved that bit wow i hate to feel like i'm ripping you off no you're not ripping you off that the game already ripped me off oh okay the game already did it good i'm just ripping off the game no but i i'm flattered that you like it you wish you run the tonight show now okay with johnny kurtley actually just did a uh a test run with jay lenno for his new uh show yeah test run i kept calling it the tonight show but it's not the tonight show anymore now it's the jay lenno show yeah what do you mean a test run um you know they kind of get used to the cameraman working the uh set you know rolling the cameras and you'll have a a guest on and do just a show that's not aired basically yeah just kind of do a practice show yeah all right let's move on let's move on to uh the second question all right here we go this is uh submitted by a dunt i believe you may pronounce it that way would you rather have a dog head with minty fresh breath or your own head with dog breath i 'm now opening the floor to questions i've already lived with my own head and dog breath so don't vote yet don't vote yet we we don't want to have any kind of uh clue i have a question yes question what kind of dog what kind of dog that is a great question how old ah okay because the breath is pretty uh it gets worse as as it would be good breath yeah it's a dog uh you are a boston terrier the cutest dog in the world um and uh here's the irony you have uh a body that ages much like your human body but your dog head ages uh seven years older for every year that you age all right yeah so uh it's getting worse yeah so basically multiply your own age by seven and that's how old your head is if you have if you have the dog's head all right so does that answer your question all right let's move on to another question kc you seem like you you're perplexed what's it what is perplexing you i don't know for some reason and i'm not trying to take it to a base area i would just think of i i oral sex on both ends on both ends and how do you mean in a sense of just like the the the breath and i know i'm not even look at these guys because i just haven't gone into this area oh no you should just be kind of you medium like wow let's get dirty no but this is what would you rather is all about is figuring out every angle it's not questions you're just musing so i um sure i don't have a question so what is your question about oral sex though and how do you give it when you have the dog's head i mean i guess that's clear hmm if you have the dog head you can give yourself for a second no no because you still have a human body but you still have a human body you have to have a dog body to be able to do you're so your tongue's longer but you could sniff other dog's asses yeah no you're allowed that in both instances oh you are yes hence the bad breath it's getting full circle i'm sorry it took us off on that oh no that is exactly how you play all right we're i'm going to close the floor for questions and then we're unless there's any more anymore no i'm closing the floor we're going to start with laren how do you vote dog head with minty fresh breath or your own head with dog breath i've already lived with my own head and dog breath i would have to go with always having minty fresh breath and with the dog heads now is that because you've already lived it and you want to experience new things new things okay interesting and if i could always be guaranteed good breath that's worth a lot to me now you have no fears about the effect on your family with the dog all the sudden you have a dog's i love dogs huh so Portuguese water dogs really so you might engender a little love from your family maybe a little extra love maybe even more love let's face it all right i like it all right let's move on to kevin how do you vote well my my vote is already in and um really first of all hey we don't hear you heard it we hear it a secret bell i've sent it in you'll be getting a few guys you're doing everything by twitter it is that's not how the show is working a uh boston terry said yes that head would be too small for my body that would look odd see now this is i have to say that uh you should have asked a question about this because actually the head is three times larger than your body in this scenario so well i plan on getting weight i plan on getting weight okay i think it's an answer it's an easy answer um definitely go with my head with the bad breath because i could take breath minutes great see yeah there you go all right kasey we're gonna move on to you i might say dog head simply because of the attention the dog engenders and the pets and the snuggles and the cuddles mm-hmm now when you pet a dog do you just pet his head like i bet my dog said a lot just wait and i feel like when a dog's present things are you know people are feeling good you know what i do with my dogs i usually look their pads you look they're like they love to look at their pads licked their pads really that's a risk Kevin that's interesting you know they you know they lift their pads they sweat through their pads i didn't know that yeah so you're basically salty yeah you're basically licking their sweat off their body well that's uh well that's uh that's that makes sense because i used to just lick salt licks and now pads i thought was a great you know wiener substitute yeah don't say wiener come it's it's a crazy world it's a crazy world it's a top security world all right let's move on to our third question this comes from harv one forty seven we won so far by the way oh yeah no we're i'm keeping track we'll have a winner at the end of this would you rather never know what day it was or always be in charge of soaping down the men at the old folks home all right i'm opening the floor for questions yes any questions about either of these particular scenarios you would never know what day it was never but what if you happen to see a calendar hanging somewhere okay that is a great question basically what happens in this scenario is anytime you look at anything that displays what data it is be at the front page of a newspaper be it uh iCal uh you are unable to see it you 're unable to focus on it and your your eyes go blurry and you can't uh really understand what you 're seeing so your mind cannot translate that kind of information it's a lot like looking at god uh your mind just kind of like translates it into whatever you think that it is because uh you're trying to make sense of what that is okay that makes sense yeah now here's my follow-up questions great brief uh soaping up these men at the old age house yes entirely the whole body oh they're whole body yes that was my question not their paths that's the one thing that you yeah you lick their paths kasey kasey i was my that was my question the whole body naked and is this just all the time you're doing this or is that is a great question you do uh you basically you work 14 hour shifts and you get a half hour off uh every six of those hours so that six hours is over time though uh it's normally you work an eight hour shift you are getting over time that is a great question okay well yes you are getting paid over time i just sure know what day of the week it is yes you always know we're like text gloves uh great question no you cannot okay and uh do your eyes work do your eyes work okay that is a great question as well uh your eyes work uh except when you stare at the old men's penises again you cannot comprehend what you're seeing so well that's that's not yeah it just but it it's well we have dogs breath depending on how you voted in the previous scenario yes that is a an important thing um however you voted in the previous thing you're keeping that going so if you have the dog's head if you voted for that you're gonna have the dog's head while you're doing either of these things so let me just get this sure right weekends off this is a 14-hour day okay was your dental dental involved it's a 14-hour day but it's almost like working as a nurse you like will work like four days on yeah four days off so i should remind there are people that do this yes with dog's heads i have a question yes case it's the last of these no it's not really okay we're still gonna keep going okay all right we're gonna shut it in that's my last question how long is this show we're gonna shut down the floor and we're gonna vote starting with kevin how do you vote well my vote um not that it matters but um what were the two choices again uh never know what day it is oh never know this well i never know what day it is anyway according to my pillbox today's f that's all i know i would definitely go with not knowing what day it is not knowing what you'd ask people oh but you would not understand their answers when they told you oh that was not included before you have to ask the question see this is a classic would you rather stumble you did not ask the question unfortunately kevin you've already voted i don't care what day it is okay i just know it's not the day to wash somebody all right kasey what do you have i'm gonna go with as well not knowing what day it is not and why is that just because this life you know great answer you can say that you guys know all right laren how do you vote i'd go with soaping down the old men because i want to see the smile on their faces oh unfortunately unfortunately laren you cannot translate those smile your brain again does not understand what those smiles mean you did not ask the question yes you you did not ask this question unfortunately so you've already voted you're stuck in this scenario now the smiles are not going to help you i'm so sorry that is a classic yeah tough break tough break hmm you may not you may not win that round all right we're gonna do one more one more this is from cut and cover would you rather lose your virginity to the dancing six flags man or have someone steal your virginity and never find out who it was so a rape basically i love it just to be clear cut and cover kind of uh how you mean my fantasy yes Scott what was the first one the first one first one is losing your virginity to this dancing six flags man now i'm imagining what if we 've lost our virginity already to the dancing six yeah unfortunately this is retroactive so it will uh it's a lot like alternate timeline theory where it will change every event in your life up till this moment yes case is losing your virginity with the six flags man essential experience it is as as a matter of fact now you would have lost your virginity i would say somewhere around ten years ago can i never take somewhere around there so uh he would not be quite as old he'd be ten years younger uh he's an older lover he knows i would be fourteen yeah okay he knows what he's doing you're fourteen just turned okay no um okay uh any other questions here um Lorraine the floor recognizes Lorraine um how's he built how's he built that is a great question now a lot of people when they see this dancing six flags man he's wearing a tuxedo in a bow tie so you can't really get a sense of his body but uh i think he can get a sense of it uh when you rip off his tuxedo he actually has a dog's body under his body so now we're talking oh so how's he how 's he builds meeting he's very very well built for a dog how's he endowed very well built okay and it's uh very hairy like a dog oh boy all right kevin any questions yes i have one follow-up question okay um in reference to these six flags yes oh i've never heard of this guy before okay um would it have to be at six flags mountain there's a great question in the six in the six flags scenario yes it is uh on colossus as a matter of time on colossus magic mountain yes so there would be um seep belts involved uh seep belts yes you would have to work around those and and uh what is he going to do to me well see now it's different for the girls than it is for the guys yes although it could be the same because for the girl for the girls i would imagine it would be some sort of vaginal virginity because that goes hand in hand with losing your virginity i'm not mine oh i'm sorry how did you lose yours well from oh from the other yeah yes okay or threatening so no so for kasey yes when if when it's with the six flags man you're basically riding him bear back okay that's how that's how you lose your virginity with him oh i have a question yes question from larry is not ever knowing who it is is that is that going to be a good experience well no because sometimes that could be sexy sometimes it can but unfortunately for this you uh go to court you try to pick him out in a lineup but it just is never yeah it's never really determined who it is and you go through your whole life knowing that that person got away with it seems like a no brainer oh here's one one last question he's got he's six flags man yes sir can you speak of yes would he keep would he keep it quiet is he a gentleman will he go easy is he just great he he unfortunately kevin he tells one person and it's just sort of spirals out of control yeah he does have a gossipy time kaby all right i guess that's one more question with a stranger yes was i asking for it you were you were dressed kind of slutty you were walking around at midnight in new york city yes you were okay okay all right i'm closing the floor for questions we're going to take it over to kasey wilson how do you vote the six flag man six flag man and why is that because i don't want to be essentially brutally raped and living in regret i think you know okay my parents living you know their lives are ruined all right well that 's how you want to vote laren yeah the hairy hairy dog body six flags all right no question all right and kevin this is very difficult stuff man i would have to go and i'm going to tell you why okay um with the six flag man only not because i look forward to it but because afterwards or before you could get on some rights and have a good time forget about it there we go you forget about it and you got the everything going for you and that is how you play would you rather all right this is indy one oh three one we're going to go to a song let's go to track four what do you say track four and we'll come right back with more comedy death ray indy one oh three one yeah i promise l would you do a song
