Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

19 Comedy Bang Bangs in the Comedy Bang Bang theme song.

I counted them today.

Sorry, got to stop you right there and say I thought it was 14.

It was 19.

The hard castle? I thought it was 14.

Here, let's listen to it again.

Here we go.

And let's count them off.

Here we go. Engineer Cody Cody.

♪♪ Catchphrase ♪ ♪♪ Okay, none so far.

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.

14!

19!

Oh, you got it right at the end.

That's 19!

You really pulled it out.

You did it.

Paul was right, 19.

How did I hear?

You were counting on the first of all...

Oh, thank you so many answers.

We were both counting.

Yeah.

But we were counting on one hand and it is easy to lose track.

14 and 19, it's the same finger you hold up.

You just can't remember how many you've rolled through.

And when counting on one hand, it is easy to lose track.

Ah, so...

♪♪ I'm sorry.

Ah, an apology so soon.

Apology tour 2016.

Oh, victory tour.

That's a victory tour.

Oh, gosh.

We should go back to all the series we want to talk to our and say thank you.

What if the Jackson's remember when they did their victory tour back in 1985?

Yeah.

What if they had just done Trump speeches in Trump?

I don't know how that would work.

If they just rambled, just like, it's great.

Jack's five is going to be great again.

Yeah, yeah.

That was fun for a while.

We don't do that anymore.

No.

You got me on my knees.

♪♪ Please, baby, please.

♪♪ The greatest Jackson five song.

I actually love that song.

That is the song.

Yeah.

I mean, it's the greatest Jackson song.

Is it the Jackson's or is it just Michael Jackson with...

It was the Jackson's.

The Jackson's.

The Jackson five had, of course, great songs like ABC and I went to back and all that.

But then they changed their name to the Jackson's and they put out maybe four or five records or so.

Why did they change the name to the Jackson's?

Was it to accommodate additional Jackson's or to...

I think someone had a bun in the oven that they were hoping for.

And then I believe there was a miscarriage and they were like, you know what?

Oh.

We were stuck with it.

So it was going to be the original Jackson five and a baby.

Yeah.

I love that movie.

And newborn infant.

Yeah.

That movie, the original Jackson's five and a baby.

And then remember they thought the set was haunted but it was a cut out of Tito.

Welcome.

Two.

Comedy Bang Bang.

And you have listening on a very...

You have listening.

You have.

It's supposed to be just a day for you.

You are.

What an episode to be your first episode if it is indeed your first episode because this is the best of Comedy Bang Bang 2016 episode one.

Trueed at.

We're doing four episodes of our best ofs.

We're counting down what the listeners of this show, super fans of this show, voted in as their favorite episodes.

More people who hate the show.

They're trying to...

They're trying to take it.

It's like the American Idol where they were trying to vote for Cenjias.

Cenjias!

One of these episodes may be the Sanjay episode.

I'll let you tell me which one you think it is.

Hint solo solo, maybe come up.

People love this solo solo.

As do I.

By the way, my name is Scott Ockerman.

I'm the host of Comedy Bang Bang every single week.

Which wasn't always the case.

There have been some substitute hosts over the years.

Been a long time since that happened.

Been a long time.

Been a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long.

Since we've had a guest host.

Twenty years ago, when...

I see Doris Vainter over there.

This is Rogue One.

I see Doris Vainter over there.

Welcome!

Across from me, of course, joining me for the twenty-fifth year in a row on the Best ofs.

The only episodes he ever does, he is right across from me.

Mr. Paul F. Tompkin.

That's right.

Reaching across the aisle in the spirit of bipartisanship.

Meaning we're two different people.

Is that what bipartisanship is?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay, then every interaction would be bipartisanship.

Good, it should be.

I wonder what year this is that we've done this together.

It might be literally our eighth time doing it together.

It might be.

I don't really know.

How long is the show?

It's our eighth anniversary and this is our eighth Best of, I believe.

This is pretty cocky that first year we had a three.

Hey, we should do a Best of.

No, it was like a, well, yeah, it was like an eight-month period from May to December.

Not even a full year.

People got a vote on their favorite episodes.

But at the same time, we were, you know, it was one of those things where we were taking a couple weeks off from the radio station.

And so it was a banked episode.

So we said, let's do a Best of.

Come on, I have to explain this to you, Mr. Showbiz.

It's for the benefit of the listener.

Being for the benefit of the listener.

What is that?

I started that and realized that song has no discernible melody.

Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite.

I don't even know.

For the benefit of Mr. Kite.

They would be a show.

But they never say being.

That's the problem.

No.

In the lyrics, they do on the title of the song.

Exactly.

It's going to be in the title, put it in the lyrics.

If it's going to be in the title, put it in the lyrics.

That's a new one.

Paul, 2016, people are calling it their, the Peter O'Toole special, My Favorite Year.

For the podcast.

No.

For life.

Not, oh boy.

But personally for you, how was your year?

Personally, it was a great year.

I mean, there were, I think, did you get a little closer?

Do you wife?

No, we say the same distance.

That's why it was so great.

Emotionally.

Look, if we're going to be together forever, it's got to be incremental.

Absolutely.

Otherwise.

Sometimes she'll ask me a question and I'll be like, let's save it.

Yeah, let's save it for 2025.

Better not tell you now.

Reply, Hazy, try again.

I'm a Magic 8-Ball.

I don't know if the listener knows that.

If you don't know what I'm listening, Paul is a Magic 8-Ball.

And round and black.

I have a little window in me.

He likes Cedric the Entertainer.

Cedric Yarbrough is the only Cedric.

He's the only Cedric.

I'm so sorry Cedric Yarbrough.

He was on, Cedric was on my podcast Bontamie Nation where he was the greatest.

He's, he's a dream.

He, uh, uh, uh, frequently on the Comedy Band Bang TV show.

Yes.

I'm recurring role as a sportscaster.

Uh, they were so funny, uh, doing this sportscaster.

Kyle, Lauren, Kyle, Kyle, Coronimer.

They were so funny together that I said, I need them back just like.

So we, any excuse.

We have to invent a reason.

Any excuse we had, we would put them back into the scripts and they would very nicely show up.

Cedric is so, is so funny and so nice and so much fun to be around.

But he revealed that he has...

But he...

You said he's very nice, so fun to be around.

But...

He...

Killed my dad.

What?

He did?

It was vehicular manslaughter.

It was a man's slaughter purpose?

Oh, no.

It's like, I can't fault him for it.

He didn't mean to do it.

I mean manslaughter implies that it's on purpose.

Vehicular manslaughter.

Sure.

Yeah.

No, whatever vehicular, non-vehicular manslaughter implies intent.

No, man, I don't think so.

Manslaughter means you killed someone.

It does not mean murder means you did it on purpose.

But you're on, but you're at fault.

It's not manslaughter she wrote.

That's a good spin up.

Yeah, she just investigated acts and mental deaths.

Oh Jessica you didn't realize the glass had a sliver of broken when you said oh I think there's been a manslaughter here.

And by the way person slaughter.

Yeah I mean. Come on 26 almost 2017 and it's not person slaughter yet. This is 2016 going on 2017.

What were you gonna sing? I don't even know. I was saying almost 2017 but you said going on which makes more sense because of the original songs is going on.

Yeah. So for you personally good year for the world.

It was tough. It gets worse and worse. Does it not? Just like every year worse. Those videos.

It gets worse and worse.

It gets worse kids. Yeah you have your experience of like I thought things were bad and then they got even worse.

Yep. But you know we're not here to dwell on that necessarily but we can. Let's celebrate the good stuff because there were many good things and I will say for such a challenging year I laughed a lot this year.

Yeah. There was some sad things that happened but I still I realized I must admit when I look back I had a lot of fun this year.

As did I some terrible things happen to me personally.

Someone on the internet said I wasn't funny.

What? Oh I know that guy. Yeah do you know that guy? I think he said that about me too.

Why genocide 666? He's got a little frog. He looks like a frog. He's a green frog.

Wait is this name? Is it frog? Is it frog? Is it frog? Do you think that? A metanol.

White what? A metanol. Is that frog? That's frog for. Hey wait a minute.

Oh you're speaking in the frog language. I'm speaking frog French. Oh I see.

What do American frogs sound like? Ribbit.

That's an answer. What are you going to say about the neo-Nazis took that Pepe drawing and adopted it because it's such a shitty drawing that sees it replicate.

I can't tell. No one seems to know. I've read article if you don't know what we're talking about there is a cartoon of a frog that was on Reddit in similar places that was not associated with white supremacy at all.

And somehow they took it over. And now when you see it it's too bad because the creator of it has no connection to that at all.

It would almost be as if Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse and within like three months someone was like, I guess what? This is a Nazi symbol and then Disneyland would never have happened.

We're now in an alternate reality where Pepe the Frog land will never happen because of this.

Never have Pepe rides.

I want a Pepe ride. I want to eat Pepe pancakes. Pepe beans?

Oh Pepe. Oh Pepe. Okay a lot.

But no one knows how it happened though. It was very weird.

I don't know like what the first guy to do is like, Hey I checked this out. This really says what we're all about.

But Pepe was a popular meme before it became a popular meme.

Popular meme that was sort of like about anti-establishment maybe in a way of like, Hey like fuck you maybe.

What's as cool as this crudely drawn frog?

Yeah or like you know there'd be a lot of pictures of him you know like flipping someone off or something like that.

And that's like hey Pepe and I guess like the ultimate anti-establishment is the alt-right.

We don't like this establishment that allows different races to walk around freely.

Guys we're getting political here.

We don't do it but you know it's the world we live in and what are we gonna ignore it?

That is capable this year. You know but they say laughter is the best medicine and I was about that's what I was gonna talk about some terrible things happen this year and just not only personally but in the world but we did laugh a lot we laugh a lot with the laugh a lot we laugh a lot so laugh a lot.

We laugh a lot. We laughed a lot and we put out a lot of product a lot of tent we slang a lot of tent.

So much content 20 episodes of bang bang you put out 18 episodes of a Jillian and you did so many live shows.

We did so many live shows together as well but you did also did your Largo live shows and a lot of tent out there and hopefully that you know we've talked about it on the show before you know you can't just like turn off wanting to laugh right you know.

Can you I don't know can you. I mean if you're on the game show make me laugh that is a great time to be able to do it if you can but a lot of people can't otherwise you know they would have to give away cars every single contestant you know.

I don't think you can wait cars I don't know I think that's what I say was very generous.

Yeah I think it was a dollar a second you didn't laugh right did you ever were on it were you ever a person.

Yeah I did like three episodes yeah mortifying I thought it was really fun because I just started comedy and I did three episodes and I felt I was in that like oh I don't know my place in the world and a lot of people I look up to do it and it would be so cool if I got to do it.

And we went and auditioned and the producer came over and I was like so what do you think he's like oh yeah I mean you guys are great and the rest of these people fucking suck.

I was like oh geez laugh.

But that was that was like such a nice I just started comedy and for a person to go oh you're so much better than everyone else was like oh I got and the first TV shows I believe I did were make me laugh three episodes and make me laugh.

The first time on camera I believe you are in this real life for a future sure you know that no I walked right from my final episode of make me laugh into the days of our life studio by accident.

Oh I see I was wearing an eye patch sure and we all know that villains were eye patches that's right and they said whoa get over here for a second and get stitches villains were eye patches and I was page for the next eight seasons yeah so anyway that's a little bit of trivia about me.

Now Paul what we're going to do on this episode.

Break it down for me.

Is we are going to be counting down the top fifteen regular comedy bang bang episodes of the year and the top four will play one every episode of the comedy bang bang live tour episodes.

Including live episodes including live episodes now those normally I would include them in the regular voting but because not everyone has how not everyone has a how subscriptions those episodes are behind the paywall.

So that's so frightening Paul don't say that.

Not everyone has been able to hear those so we want to give people a taste but also they naturally get lighter votes so I wanted to honor those because the tour was I think some of the best episodes we did all year.

Agreed so I want to make sure people hear some of them so we'll be hearing one of those for each of these four best episodes and we're counting down the top fifteen and you voted for them.

You this is on you this is on you we didn't we we have no horse in this race yeah we have no skin in this game I don't care I look.

I don't care what people thought were their favorite episodes I don't care at all I don't care I don't give a shit about what people think they're wrong what they do what they say.

Wait a minute I don't care if they're alive.

Well hold on are you like a me list.

Yeah okay I don't care about earth.

Oh you don't care about earth no even dirt grass forget yeah yeah the very yeah that makes up the earth trees yeah all of that rocks no you can stop.

We all know lava minerals lava magma magma magma magma magma.

We're going to do the to this particular episode by the way we're going to be counting down number fifteen number fourteen number thirteen and number twelve so four regular apps and then one live.

Fourth live episode I see so if you're just listening to this one we're going to get better and better each one so make sure that you listen all the way to the fourth.

The fourth deputy according to you people you can't say you people.

Dwayne the rock Johnson hashtag it.

So keep listening to these because if you like this one it just gets better and better and better and better if you like the worst one you'll be like.

I don't know if you're dumb enough to like these shitty episodes if you're if you're such a brainless.

More that you listen to this last one you're like.

The bridge all that.

The old thing.

The old.

My fork again.

I forget what's food I want not.

Three hundred and fifty eight time this year.

How do I even count that high?

I'm double get it.

If you're one of those mindless cretins.

Then let's continue listening because you'll enjoy it.

Yes exactly.

There is hope for you and speaking of hope I hope to get to our first clip right now.

What do you say?

Oh.

I thought when you said speaking of hope that I was going to talk about Barack Obama's campaign.

Yeah.

And then segue into Star Wars Episode four a new hope.

A new hope of course and Rogue one is out now.

Subtitle subtitle Star Wars story.

Okay.

Normally the subtitle is the what we call them as in you know.

Exactly.

Star Wars Rogue one.

So why don't we then okay since we call you know return of the Jedi all that why don't we call this a Star Wars story instead of Rogue one like colloquially.

So is okay.

You know what I mean?

You're using Star Wars.

Did you see Star Wars?

Yeah.

People didn't say did you see the Force Awakens.

Right.

You know what I mean?

They said did you see Star Wars.

Okay.

Well that's different than what I was saying.

I was saying people said did you see Empire Strikes Back to see Return of the Jedi?

Yeah.

Star Wars is the only one that we actually say instead of a new hope.

A new hope is a terrible title for a film.

But I think we say it is terrible.

And I think it's time we re-litigated that.

Okay.

Bad idea.

Poorly executed.

Calling it that?

Yeah.

Well it was never supposed to be the title of the film.

Here's the problem.

They called it Star Wars.

That's right.

They just called it Star Wars.

When it came out it was just Star Wars.

Yeah.

And then in the crawl they were like oh we got to have a title for this dumb chapter.

And then we had to have a title for the title of the film.

Certainly we would work harder on this.

So George Lopez is just locust, right?

George Lopez was just like.

Hey.

Let me get it on this.

The offensive.

What?

And it's not even good.

He's a person.

Wait.

Is that the bare minimum?

You were going to say he's a person.

That's the bare minimum for an impression for you.

Is that if it sounds like a person?

Okay.

You succeeded on that front.

It does sound like a person.

Let me take Umbridge with the dialer.

I was like what I was doing it.

I was like wait what does he sound like?

You know.

Has he been so long?

That we've forgotten what George Lopez sounds like?

I was trying to think in my mind like what's a typical thing that he does in his act.

And you came up with.

Hey.

I tell you what though.

There's definitely video of George Lopez in some bit going.

Hey.

Stereotypes are true.

Um.

Anyway, I was going to say a new hope.

Yeah.

George Lopez just wrote down a new hope like who cares.

First thought best thought.

Well.

And now because there were more than one Star Wars film.

He has to now call it a new hope.

But for some, I remember even as a kid reading an interview and it was something to do with when he and Spielberg were kids and they would see these chapter plays or whatever.

Right.

I think he just.

They said Stephen come over here.

Yeah.

They said.

Oh, that's you mind something different than you said.

Well, no.

Well, I was I was I had to make the noise with my mouth.

I couldn't actually do it with my hand.

But then you were pointing your hand.

What are you doing?

Yeah.

I'm glad the listener can't see this.

I'm the noise I'm making.

Yes, it sounds like a blowjob.

But it also sounds like someone put lotion in their hand.

Oh, sorry.

I'm thinking.

Oh, never mind.

Wait, what?

Wait, wait, wait.

No, it doesn't matter.

Paul, tell me.

Let's not have an argument about this.

Just explain your feelings.

I thought you were eating a Wendy's Frosty.

Oh, you thought I was eating a Wendy's Frosty.

I thought you were eating a Wendy's Frosty.

You're like really scooping it in.

You've seen me eat before.

Is that how I sound when I eat?

I never look.

Now you and I have eaten meals together.

Sure, and you're wearing a sleep mask.

I always put a sleep mask.

But you're able to hear it.

And I can hear it.

So that's what I sound like.

That's what you sound like.

Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah, we always eat it Wendy's.

Well, you always order a Frosty.

I never eat regular protein.

Scott and I have a standing luncheon date.

We eat it Wendy's.

It's like Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks.

That's right.

Every single day we get together for lunch at Wendy's.

But on our sleep masks, I need ice cream.

Oh, you were one too.

Of course.

I'm not able to see, but I still listen on.

No, because I have a sleep mask.

You wait until after I put mine on.

What a gentleman.

I do.

After you, I always say, and you don't know what that's referring to.

They don't.

Well, now you do.

Jackass.

He got me.

Anyway, I was going to say that we call them emperors to expect.

You don't call it Star Wars.

But I think when the new one comes out, you refer to it as Star Wars.

Yes, I didn't call it.

You're right.

The force awaits.

It's when you're talking about them in the past.

Which one do we call Star Wars?

We call New Hope Star Wars.

We call one through three Star Wars.

Yeah, when they're in theaters.

When they're in theaters.

Refer to it as Star Wars.

But Empire Strikes Back, I called Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

I called Return of the Jedi.

Well, that's what I'm saying is I think I called them Star Wars then too.

I call them because if you recall the font, it was like really big, the Empire Strikes Back.

And then just to remind you, it had like star up at the top and wars down below.

I do remember that.

Just like remember this is part of Star Wars.

But everyone I knew called it the Empire Strikes Back.

Are you going to see Empire Strikes Back?

This is part of Star Wars.

But those are the only two that we call by their actual subtitles.

Well, we have to agree to disagree.

Because I think now, of course, to disagree to disagree.

To differentiate them now, of course we use those subtitles.

But when they're in theaters, I'm going to say from back in the day to present.

This may be a Philly thing.

This may be a generational thing.

Even though it was occurring at the same time.

I know.

We're at look.

I'm two years older than you.

When I was a kid, we did things a little different.

Oh, yeah.

When I was a kid, at the exact same time, you had a slurry younger.

It's so easy.

I believe I called it Empire Strikes Back and returned to the Jedi.

But now you're right.

We should call this one a Star Wars story.

We should just call it a Star Wars story.

Instead of what is it called?

Rogue One.

I think everyone's going to call this one Rogue One, don't you think?

I think they are.

This is the first one in 25, 30 years that we're going to actually call by its actual name.

It's outside of the typical continuity that we're familiar with.

I think it's a prequel of sorts.

It's inside the continuity.

But it's outside the sphere of characters that we are normally accustomed to.

It's outside of what is considered normal, right, or just.

Right.

Is it actually out yet?

By the way, I'm going to check here.

We got, yeah, it's out.

So it's from what I understand, a tank to the box office this weekend.

Oh, okay.

Because of the protests, of course.

You've heard about the protests.

The Star Wars story protests?

There were Star Wars protests, which killed the film.

The Trump people were protesting Star Wars.

Why were they doing that?

I don't even want to get into it.

They Hamilton and Star Wars, the two things they protested.

Hamilton?

Hamilton's closed.

They shuttered it.

Wrapped it all up.

Too bad.

Oh, well.

Let's tell you what, why don't we get into the countdown?

What do you say?

Why don't we get into the countdown?

Our first clip of the countdown is episode 15.

Number one, five.

All right, episode 15.

All right.

Now, Paul, you don't know what these episodes are.

No.

These are also a surprise to you.

They're all a surprise to me.

And you are a part of some of them.

Guy can tell you that.

Yeah, and I'm a quarter goldfish.

So I don't remember a lot of things.

And I'm constantly...

You're a quarter goldfish in the brain and the penis.

Yep.

Those are the...

That's the quarter.

Mm-hmm.

So you don't have a penis, you just lay eggs.

Yeah.

Love it.

Like you love them.

Do it right now.

Stop laying eggs, by the way.

When you...

When you fertilize these, please.

All right, let me come on.

Ah, there you go.

I love decorum.

No, you don't know what these episodes are.

You don't know what order they...

The results are in.

And so that's why I'm going to tell you some information about them as right before...

Oh, that's why.

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

So now what we do is we vote from Thanksgiving of the previous year to Thanksgiving.

And that gives us time to compile the clips.

So normally we've talked about this on the show before.

Normally the older the episode, the more people have forgotten about it.

Exactly.

And the newer the episode, the more recent they are and they usually vote for those.

Over the older episode.

It just makes sense.

It's human nature.

What is the surprise you then, sir, to know that our 15th most popular episode of the year was from January 4th.

What?

That's right.

The first episode of this calendar year, not the first episode in contention, but January 4th.

Mm.

That's right.

Well, what about the theory we just talked about?

I know.

It's been blown out of the water by this one example, but perhaps more later on.

I don't know.

You said post snap out of it.

Thank you.

I'm going to be slapping Paul several times throughout this show.

Yeah, that's another tradition we have.

Yeah.

Slap fight.

One side to slap fight.

Slap fight.

Okay, that means I get to slap you.

Anytime you call it out.

Yeah.

What are these days slap back?

We'll see.

Slap back.

I have a great credit card.

It gets lots of slap back.

I don't know what that means.

Like, even if I maybe.

All right.

That is episode 393.

This is episode 393.

It's from January 4th.

First episode of the calendar year, Paul, do you know what the tradition is for comedy, bang, bang?

First episode of the calendar year.

You, Ben Schwartz and Horatio Sal.

That's right.

Ben Schwartz, Horatio Sands.

We always get together.

Maybe we will this next year in 2017.

Who knows?

Traditions are made to be broken, but.

That's not true.

Quite.

Oh, really?

They were made to continue on.

They're made to continue on.

The whole point.

I got, there's that tradition of marriage that I got into.

I thought that that was made to be broken as well.

Oh, cool up and I are getting divorced.

Why?

Yeah.

Scott, because it's a tradition.

Does it make me broken?

Yes.

How did you want to find out?

Hold on.

Divorce is also a tradition.

That's true.

It's an institution.

That's right.

About 50% of the time.

Even more.

I don't know if that's true anymore.

Oh, really?

Has it lowered?

I think it's lowered.

Because less people are actually getting married probably.

I think more people are young guys.

They're dying.

They're being their teens.

Oh, boy.

Okay.

This is an episode called Peanuts Awareness.

Or Peanut Awareness.

I can't remember.

I think it was Peanut Awareness.

Peanut Awareness.

A great episode.

I remember a lot of laughs on this one.

These are going to hear it.

Now, this is Ben Schwartz.

Of course, you know him as BB-8, the voice of BB-8 in Star Wars.

Oh, proven your point.

And he is himself and ratio sands.

He comes in with...

Sometimes he's himself and then he goes into a character.

That's right.

Sometimes he's himself and has the barest grasp upon a character.

This is a character named Ted Ronson.

He's portraying a character named Ted Ronson.

And he has...

There's a month that he wants to call attention to for some special awareness.

Very fun episode.

This is our clip for your episode number 15.

Here we go.

Number one five.

I don't usually do podcasts.

No, what kind of business you own you through Peanuts at us?

Is that somehow involved in your business?

Yeah, I sell Peanuts.

You sell Peanuts.

I sell Peanuts.

Okay.

Wait, I sell Peanuts.

You sell Peanuts.

Say it again.

Peanuts.

You heard it, right?

I heard it on that last one.

I think this is a front.

Peanuts at us is a front so he can get away with trying to talk about what he really sells.

Yeah, are you...

Are you...

And you're gonna have to catch it.

Are you a male escort is what we're trying to get at.

Hey man, I've done a lot of things.

Oh cool.

I've been everywhere.

Dude.

I've been everywhere.

That's true.

I had done a lot of jobs.

And this is one I'm kind of doing well with.

So how does one sell a penis?

Not to say this guy and I are interested, but let's say it was kind of...

Well...

Yeah.

You go...

You go to your stadium or what have you.

Yeah.

And then you say that you have to buy the peanuts.

You have to buy peanuts.

Peanuts.

Okay.

And then they put all the peanuts in a big box and then I walk down into the stadium and I go, Peanuts!

Peanuts!

Who wants a penis?

So far it could be peanuts still.

Could be peanuts still.

Tell me what happens when...

Let's say I'm...

Yes sir, I like a penis.

I undo my pant zipper.

Okay, now here you go.

I pull out my big eight inch...

It's a good thing.

A pack of peanuts.

Oh, peanuts!

Throw the peanuts at them!

That's a peanut!

Okay, why are you keeping them in there?

Can I ask you that?

Well, I want...

It's a little shock and awe.

Little shock.

Little shock and awe!

Little shock!

Little shock and awe!

I got friends in low, please.

Okay, come on.

Come on.

I'm trying to join in, guys.

I don't know your songs.

Ted, you...

You want a penis?

Yeah, I do want some.

Wait, wait.

No.

Listen to what he's saying, dude.

You're not hearing him.

I want some peanuts.

Everybody knows, the best thing about going ball game.

Get nice, cold beer.

Yeah.

And get a nice, long, tasty, girthy penis.

Penis?

Stuff it right in your mouth and wash the ball game.

What does it look like?

They're still helping me.

What do your peanuts look like?

Well, these are really good peanuts.

Oh, peanuts, okay, good.

They're really good peanuts.

These, I get from a farm in upstate New York.

Oh, they could be...

Okay, it's the peanuts.

That's where they come from.

Roasted, salted.

Oh, great.

Sometimes, fat people can't eat salt.

You know, you get some on top of the ones.

Sure, okay, don't show us.

Sure.

And then this is a beige.

Okay.

That's a slumpy on limb.

Too straight, right?

And then it gets thin in the middle, but not too thin.

Then it gets big again.

There's got little...

Indentations in it.

It's ribbed.

The peanut is ribbed.

Oh, no.

Does it grow when you touch it?

When you push it, it pops.

Oh, no!

I don't know.

And it's peanut.

I'm not sure.

And it explodes.

It shoots out.

What does it shoot out?

Like a little, like a, like a jizz.

Oh, okay.

He's talking about peanuts.

I'm talking about peanuts right now.

Just switch.

So you are talking about peanuts.

I'm kind of here too for man's health month, January, 2016.

For what?

You go, a lot of guys are embarrassed to go to the doctor and say, hey, look at my dick.

And then like the doctor.

Oh, penis, penis, penis, penis.

So how many times do you go to the doctor to say, hey, look at my dick?

I like to go, well, I go, uh, by quarterly.

Can I say, by quarterly means eight times a year.

So let me say this real quick.

Yeah.

I'm going to be you and you're going to be the doctor.

Take me through your doctor's like, because this is the sentence you say, okay?

You said, you said, look at my dick.

What do you say?

He said, look.

Hey, look at my dick.

Okay, I'm going to be the guy you be the doctor.

Okay.

I'll be the doctor.

Okay.

Tell me how this works.

Okay.

Hey, look at my dick.

Um, well, we, we like to use the word penis around.

Oh, it is a real doctor.

Am I worried?

Yes?

Hey, Luke Skywalker here.

Hey, look, what's going on?

I am out of here.

You farted and then you what?

Even his fart sound like lights speeders.

What the fuck is going on?

I don't know what's going on with him.

Uh, it's a light speeder.

Lights, sand speeder.

What is it?

Oh, okay.

Shh, shh, shh.

It's a land speeder.

Land speeder.

Okay.

Thank you.

I'm not a nerd.

So I am.

I want to talk the entire collection of action figures, which at the time were three and a half inches.

Did you really have them?

Mm hmm.

And I stuffed them in my butthole and that's how I stole them from the grocery store.

You stole them.

I did.

I was a little kid and I was so tired about it.

I couldn't talk.

I couldn't stop telling everybody.

I was like, I got to get this.

I won't let them figure.

And so I did one time.

I went in there and I got a tour home, my butthole pants.

So you had to take them out of the box, huh?

Yeah, I don't have the boxes, I'm fortunate.

Oh, okay.

Be so funny if you didn't.

I know.

I was trying to send them out of the box.

Oh, well.

Well, you know, sometimes I like to stick to the truth, to the facts.

Yeah, sure.

I don't like to expand the story for showbooking.

No, I'm embarrassed to talk.

We've only just begun to live.

Are you checking your penis out?

No, can I...

So are there different methods we can do, like, so I know Tessicular Cancer is a big thing you should check for.

By the way, I just started having your house.

Am I certain what?

How to do it, like how to check?

Yeah, I mean you just kind of like cradle your balls, barrels?

What do you call them?

You just...

You just cradle your barrels and then you just kind of squeeze them as hard as you can.

No.

And if they explode, they...

No, no.

You think you want to make sure there's no cancer in there, so squeeze them as hard as you can?

Let me take you through what you just said.

I'll take your balls, barrels.

Squeeze them as hard as you can.

And if they explode, they don't have cancer.

They don't have cancer.

You know you're cancer-free.

Because you can't squeeze it when it's got a cancer in it.

Because it's hard.

It's hard.

Exactly.

So if it's hard like a rock...

Testies are hard as a rock.

Doo doo doo doo.

Ahhh!

We are hard!

We are family!

To be Iron Curtain.

I got Iron Curtain's with me!

Oh, oh, meat curfers!

Rasto cowboy!

Alright.

You're such a fucking bummer.

Wait, you think he's an idiot?

I think he's a dumb dumb.

Ah, he may be.

So what's your deal?

You sell peanuts?

Or you sell peanuts?

I don't know, I can't...

I sell peanuts.

Jesus Christ!

Let's raise the level of conversation here.

You sell peanuts.

That's what you came to talk about, right?

And also a penis awareness.

A penis awareness.

So I can see why you get confused.

Well, sometimes, and there's a...

Right now, the real great time about peanuts.

Peanuts are peanut.

Can we make a...

Can you listen to the work?

Here's a smile.

Sorry, you're right.

Here's a smile.

Sorry, you're right.

We'll figure that out.

Here's what I want you to do.

I want you to write the word penis on a sheet of paper.

I want you to write the word peanuts on a sheet of paper.

And anytime you say that word, I want you to hold up the one you're talking about, alright?

Here we go.

Alright, he's written the words.

Okay, you have one on one side, one on the other.

Alright, here we go.

Alright, so...

Do it for real.

Okay, good.

Okay, well now you're drawing it.

Okay, that's a peanut.

That's a peanut.

I hope to God that's a peanut.

Otherwise it's a bit.

No, it's a...

He drew balls on it.

It's a penis.

Okay, I see the proportions.

Yeah, okay.

Oh, it's not going to work for the podcast.

We took a picture.

Check out the picture.

He literally drew a big piece up first.

I'm sorry.

He waited for Scott how to say, well that's obviously a peanut.

And he drew big balls on the bottom of it.

So technically the words he was saying is right.

It's a penis.

That's the funniest thing that could happen this year.

Oh, gosh.

Alright, so point to the one that you're being when you're talking about it.

Okay.

So...

Yes.

Are you pointing to the penis?

Alright.

Can you see?

Yes, I can see.

Listen.

Alright, listen.

I'm listening.

You've got to listen.

I also want you to look at what I want to look.

You're married.

You've got to think.

Think about it.

If that's a pew to me.

If that's a penis, baby.

For it up.

What is he writing years writing some words or something like that?

Okay.

Peanut, penis.

Okay.

Here we go.

Alright.

So talk about what you were going to talk about.

Peanut's awareness.

Alright.

Point to the one.

Okay.

Penis awareness.

Yes.

I know that you're married.

Yes.

So it's good.

And it's good that you do that because your wife could notice it's something wrong with your penis.

Yeah.

And would tell you.

Yeah.

This young man on the other hand.

Not married.

Do you ever go to Dick Doctor?

What's a Dick Doctor?

It's a Dick Doctor.

Is this what it's called?

Is there a Dick Doctor?

Dick Doctor.

What's it called?

Dick Doctor?

Just a Dick Doctor.

You have unprotected sex?

No.

I tried my best never to have under, I'm pretty good about it.

I never have under-sex.

Never.

You said you never, you almost never.

Well, well, like, if I have a girlfriend and she's on birth control.

Like, if you don't know someone?

No, if I don't know someone else, I'll put a condom, yeah.

You don't want to get a friend pregnant?

No, of course.

I never use a condom on a stranger.

How many friends do you fuck with?

I don't want to get an enemy pregnant.

Even more.

No, by the way, that's it.

You still keep your enemies even closer.

Yeah, that's true.

Get them pregnant.

And if you think you might have caught something at a Christmas party or something, there's a really good test you can do at home.

That's dip your dick and sprite.

What?

And sprite.

And if it turns blue, then you got HIV.

It turns blue.

You got HIV.

Some sort of litmus.

The real simple test you get to do.

Would it work with 7up as well or does it work with Pepsi or Coke?

No, it has to be Sprite.

It has to be Sprite.

What is the ingredient in there that makes it...

Someone's sort of pH.

I'm thirsty now.

I'm actually 30.

I noticed you brought a bottle of Sprite in here.

Do you mind if I just take a drink of it?

It's got to.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

What's casting is really it's...

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Oh no.

Blue Sprite.

What is this?

Some sort of new promotional campaign or...?

I brought some...

Scott.

I brought HIV piss in here to show you guys.

Wait.

What?

Scott.

Hold on.

Let me drink it again so I can do a spit tank.

Scott, don't.

You're going to spit on me.

Oh, you did do a spit tank.

You fucking idiot.

Got all over yourself.

Wasn't worth it.

That was...

That's how the spit takes.

Where did you get this HIV piss from?

Where did you get that outfit?

I've never seen something where Tamaraean just peed.

I was very weird.

They're just all like in the shape of pant legs.

It's very weird.

Yeah, outside of art that I picked up these Septemberean pants.

We have fun Ted, don't you feel it?

Don't you think?

I do, but...

Look, there's no fun if you have problems with your peanuts.

Yeah, what happens in peanuts awareness month?

Oh, we just tell people not to give toddlers peanuts to be aware of the peanuts.

So it's a choking hazard awareness?

Choking and sometimes people sit on peanuts.

Oh, God, just which one is it?

What is what?

Wait, what are babies choking on?

Sometimes people sit on peanuts.

What does it taste like?

Tell me what it tastes like.

Do you know what a peanut taste like?

Just tell me.

That's not what I heard.

Is it peanuts?

It's what a peanut tastes like.

So just imagine that stuff down your tassel.

Salty, salty, and chewy.

I got to ask, what are babies choking on?

Please point at the right one.

Oh, God, dear God.

Please point at the right one.

Raj, I mean, Ted, please.

Yes, no.

Okay, he pointed at the peanuts.

Oh, he's going back and forth.

All right, it's a peanut.

Whew, that was a close one.

Let me tell you, the best way to eat a roasted peanut is just by itself.

Open it up, pull it out.

You usually get two, sometimes you get three in there.

Yeah, that's a good point.

Just put it, open your mouth.

Yeah.

It stuffs through your lips.

What is happening right now?

Is that a fit?

Move the tip of that tongue out of the way.

Move the tongue out of the way.

Move that tongue out of the way.

Just keep stuff out of stuff.

I'm going to tell you something right now.

If it's a penis or a peanut, you're doing it wrong.

Supposedly if there's three of them.

Yeah, the three of them and you got to move your tongue out of the way.

Then you stick that peanut all the way back there and you gag.

Oh, God.

You gag yourself.

Why am I rock hard right now?

This is not the way I want to start the year.

By the way.

Your old fault, you invited Ted Ronson to the show.

That's true.

We were having fun with Raj and fucking Ted Ronson.

We had to eat a peanut.

Number one, five.

Ha ha ha ha ha.

Peanut awareness.

Peanut awareness time.

Peanut.

You put the peanut in the drink.

You put the peanut in the poison peanut.

What if in the trial, we're talking about a lot of hot buttons.

You use it on this episode.

Oh, fun stuff.

Fuck it.

Let's talk about what if in the trial it came out that it was like, it turns out Mr.

Cosby has not been slipping drugs into drinks.

He just puts one peanut in everyone's drink.

Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

What if that comes out in the trial?

Well, if that comes out and everyone's like has to apologize to him.

But one now, oh, so it comes out of this is actually what was happening.

Yeah.

Now that this is what his defense is claiming.

Yeah.

What actually happened, they proved it conclusively.

You saw all these women are like, I guess now that I think about it.

There was one peanut in my drink.

And I had consensual sex with him.

Ha ha ha ha ha.

I apologize, Mr. Cosby.

But now, okay, so, so if the peanut is not drug, do that anyway.

It's not drug.

It's just a peanut.

He's just got a weird thing about putting a peanut.

Put the peanut in there too.

He makes it feel powerful.

Put the peanut in the drink.

Put the peanut in your drink.

I'm not saying it's likely.

I'm saying what if it happens?

Well, it's highly unlikely.

Ha ha ha ha ha.

But there's a chance.

But before I could address the what if of it, I want to make sure I understand.

Ha ha ha ha.

He's swimming.

Ha ha ha ha.

They're having consensual sex with him.

Consensual sex with him.

Later in their minds, they reframe as him having drunked them.

Well, they got caught up in the one who had to be famous.

Oh, sure.

Oh, okay.

So they know they're lying.

It's not that.

Some of them know they're lying and some of them are just in there.

We're all the heroes of our own stories.

Some of them did have a peanut slipped into their drink.

They all had peanut slipped into their drink.

Well, well, but I mean, some of them have peanut slipped into the drink and that caused them to have consensual sex with Dr. Lee McChocke.

No, it never caused them.

They chose to.

No, no, no.

Okay.

Or they were so impressed by it that they chose to.

I just meant something about the peanut being put into the drink.

Don't blame the peanut.

I'm saying that that all expression.

Two separate things.

You're going to hide behind that.

Don't blame the peanut.

He put a peanut in the drink that's totally separate from them having consensual sex.

Consexual.

To my maids and conceptual.

So what happens is at the trial.

Yes.

At the trial, every single person.

The defense says your honor.

All my client did.

The defense doesn't know about this.

This is something they stumble into.

They stumble into it because so many people are up there on the stand.

They go, well, I found a peanut in my drink.

And then the defense attorney goes, so many peanuts.

And then whispers and Bill Cosby's ear.

He goes, oh yeah, of course I put the peanut in the drink.

I like to put the peanut in the drink.

And they go, stop everything.

Or let the trial continue and let me speak.

That's probably more specific.

Yeah.

If they stopped everything, it would just be like, well, you're free to go, Mr. Cosby.

Okay.

So.

And then they re they call everyone back up to the stand in tandem.

All of the victims, supposed to victim.

In tandem.

They say, everyone come back up together.

Oh, okay.

Come back up together.

Yeah.

Big group style.

Family style.

All of garden style.

Yeah.

Come back up here.

So it's my tallest in back.

Shortest in front.

And they say, did you all find peanuts in your drinks?

And answer all at the same time.

Three, two, one.

Yes.

Your honor.

So, so it comes out.

Uh huh.

When they're on the stand individually.

Yes.

They all mention having seen a peanut in their drink off handedly.

Off hand.

Off handedly.

The defense lawyer puts two and two together, calls everyone back up.

And then calls Mr. Cosby to the sand says, isn't it true that you just, you didn't put any drugs in the drink.

So you just put a peanut in the drink.

And Mr. Cosby says, Dr. Cosby, so sorry.

So sorry.

I put the peanut in the drink.

Which then causes the judge to go, you're free to go, Mr.

Cosby.

And then he goes, sorry, Dr. Cosby.

Right.

Okay.

Not likely.

I'm not saying it's like.

So you're saying, what if that happened?

What if that happened?

That would be weird.

It would be weird, wouldn't it?

All right.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we'll have your episode 14 right after this.

Pretty bang, bang.

We're back here.

Paul at Tomkins, coffin up a storm.

I did.

I put the peanut in.

And the countdown's really moving.

We've heard one episode.

It's really moving.

Haven't we?

It's really moving, haven't we?

Now, why don't we get to it?

Let's get to your episode 14.

Yeah.

Number one, four.

All right.

Episode 14 now.

Number 14 with a bullet.

We, the previous episode was from very early in the year.

You said January is ever called.

January is January 4th.

This episode is from November 7th.

What?

Just a mere month ago, right before the cutoff date.

But under the wa, just right under the wa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, as a matter of fact, if I may check my notes, this is the latest. Oh, I don't even, well, I'll just say this is the latest episode.

I know that's going to give some people, they're going to realize the next two in the, in the eligibility period are not in the countdown.

But this is the latest episode.

Let's get a shot for a second.

I don't know that you've always employed this system of tons and tons of printed out emails.

Is this always been when you've.

Someone just printed it.

Normally it's on my phone.

Oh, OK.

Yeah.

Normally I look out on my phone, but it's a little bigger here in the emails.

And so.

And you know what?

Our eyes are now with these to be.

Are they all?

No.

Oh, sir.

But you're going to hear lots of this.

Over the next four episodes.

This is the proof.

Lots of paper wrestling.

No, this is the latest episode that was voted for.

Insane.

And this is an episode.

This is number 456.

This is an episode called the historic wrap.

Oh, yes, that's right.

This is Jason Manzukas and Paul F.

Tompkins himself.

That's right.

That's me.

First episode on the countdown, old boy.

I can't.

I'm a little mad that it took two episodes in.

OK.

Can I just say this right now to the listener?

You wanted to be in the very first one.

It's a mystery to me why I'm not in all of them.

And I have no choice but to take it as a personal affront.

Well, you're not on the show every single week.

That would be weird if you weren't in that.

We'll get into that later.

But that's a separate piece.

Hey, good looking.

I'll be back to pick you up later.

And we'll talk about that.

Jingle bells.

Yeah, it's Jason.

It's a few.

Well, let's save it though.

Yeah, well, let's save it and savor it.

Mm-hmm.

So you're upset though.

I'm furious that anyone votes for any episodes that I'm not on.

And that I'm not on the show every week.

OK, you'd like to be on the show every week, really.

Oh, this sounds like a be careful what you wish for.

I know what you're saying.

It's a real monkeys paw.

You're a real monkeys paw.

Hey, how dare you?

You're a real Zoltar machine.

I'm turning everyone into the...

I got confused.

I thought I was turning people into little boys.

But Zoltar would turn them back at the end.

He's essentially Zoltar is stealing life from people.

He's taking 20 years of life out of people.

What does he do with those 20 years?

I don't know that we talked about this.

We have not.

On mic or if this was off stage.

Was it?

OK.

Maybe we have this conversation during the tour.

OK.

I would like to see a sequel to Big that is just Elizabeth Perkins' character.

We may have talked about this.

And how she deals with that moment where she sees the little boy that she had sex with as a man.

And I think waits around another 20 years hoping that he comes back to her.

You don't think she's haunted by this weird situation?

Of like, I just had sex with an adult penis that is in reality a child penis.

A child's brain was in this man's body.

He tricked me into having sex with him.

And now I see he's just a little boy.

And now I have to live with that.

I have to live with that.

Yeah.

And it's the best sex I've ever had.

And that's...

I was in love with this child man.

Yeah.

And now I'm attracted to children.

Yeah.

Well...

I'm presumed...

I didn't mean to suggest that.

That's what I'm presumed to be.

But she would be suspicious of every man.

Every single man.

Go from that point on.

Can I ask you a question?

What did you do from age 10 to 30?

Yeah.

Where'd you go to college?

Talk to me about your other girlfriends.

You've had sex before, right?

How old were you?

You're not a ten-year-old virgin.

How old were you when you started shaving?

When did you get your driver's license?

Ah, good stuff.

All right, speaking of good stuff, let's hear a little bit of, this is your episode 14, the historic rap Paul, you play...

Cal Solomon.

Cal Solomon, founding member of the Sugar Hill.

Now talk about the origins of this character.

Did this start on spontaneous nation, your own podcast?

It did.

It started as...

In the early days of the podcast, I would...

Because I wanted the ads to be entertaining, as well as the rest of the show, I would often make up characters just for the ads.

And they would sort of have little stories that would continue.

And some of those were...

Allie Peterson.

This was from...

We heard him last week.

It started as an ad person.

And Cal Solomon was one.

And his story got pretty detailed over the course of these ads.

And so when we were doing the tour and we were doing so many shows...

You had to think up characters to do and film...

Yeah, yeah.

I believe we did 40 live shows this year.

You maybe did 38 of those.

Or maybe 39.

I think I only missed San Diego and...

Yeah, I think I only missed San Diego.

I think I only missed San Diego because you did South by Southwest as well.

Yeah.

That's one that I...

Yeah, that may be the only one that you missed.

I think so.

So over the course of that many shows, in order to keep it fresh and not just...

Certified fresh.

For the audience.

In order to get our fresh certification, which we had to do before every show, we had to go to the local podcast certification board and get the show certified fresh.

It just seemed like rather than trying to invent stories, countless stories for the same characters.

The same people that we've done.

Which frankly we've already been doing.

Several tours, yes.

That new stories for new characters.

New stories for new characters.

Newsies.

And so I went and looked up on the spontaneous nation wiki that a young lady named...

I don't know if this is her actual name.

Her screen name is Marius Perkins.

And she has kept a list.

Is she a character?

She might be.

Who does her?

I think that's a Mary Holland.

She kept a list of the advertising characters and their stories.

So it was a huge help.

Wow.

Okay.

So you would look these up as we were on tour and go, oh yes.

This is Cal Solomon.

So this is one of those he made it to the tour as I recall New York was the first time that he was on and now has made it to the show proper.

Right in under the wire from November, first we're going to hear me talking to Jason Manzukas for a bit and then Cal Solomon comes in and we'll hear a little bit about what he's up to.

This is episode 14.

Number one, four.

Should there be bathrooms on subways?

No, no.

Why?

Oh, categorically, no.

But like a whole car.

Nope.

A whole, a back car.

Oh, well that caboose.

Well, that usually is the bathroom car.

Right.

But you know what I mean?

Like should they just make a whole caboose where it's like, look guys.

Or just a hole in the ground.

Yeah.

Just a hole in the car.

Yep.

Yeah.

Where it's just like squat over this.

Yep.

Well, that would be amazing if people would just get up and walk to a hole in the subway car.

Would they do it and just start shitting away?

Like, okay, the first person to do it would be embarrassed.

How far away are we from people shitting in public?

I think pretty close.

I mean everyone, no one mind sex tapes, right?

Like, you know what I'm saying?

At this point it's like, anyone you want to see naked practically has a sex tape.

Sure.

Yeah, okay.

Yeah, I have a sex tape.

You do.

So that's...

Wait, you do?

I don't personally.

Does it feature your big lumpy cock?

Big and lumpy.

Big lumpy cock.

Big, dumb, sexy.

Have you checked out my cock yet?

Big lumpy cock.

But you know what I mean?

It's not that far off of just like, you know, like so many celebrities are out there, you know, playing with their poons.

But what I'm saying is like, playing with their poons?

I mean, like, you know what, man?

You know what, man?

But we have to respect people and, you know, playing with their poons is just totally cool.

But I'm not going to sludge him the poon players.

No, no, that's what I'm saying.

But so many of these people are hacked, but so many people just...

Their hacks?

They're hacked.

But they...

No.

They're hacked.

I'm close to coasting.

Because I'm trying to make a point here.

But so many people willingly put it out now and just like stuff where they're like, hey, a dude coming on you.

Oh, great.

Okay.

You know that how far away are we from just people going like, ah, fuck it.

Yeah.

And just like, yep.

I feel like that is, I feel like we're not far away from them.

I do.

Great point.

We are weeks away from public.

Weeks away.

Wow.

You think by the end of the year?

Public shit stations.

Public shit stay.

What do you mean when you say public shit stations?

Like, you know, like areas in public where you can just like...

Where it's not walled off.

No.

Like a bathroom.

It's just like some chicken wire.

It's basically like a dog park.

Like a dog walk.

Yeah.

Versus like just going there.

Yeah.

But I bet that's how it starts.

I bet people start using dog parks as toilets.

Mm-hmm.

Next thing you know.

But that's, I would say the first person is going to be embarrassed of like, really, this is legal and then feel ashamed and then buy.

I love that legality is your main concern.

But you know what I mean?

Like really, this is...

I want a shit in public.

I'm just not sure if it's legal or not.

I want a shit in public.

I don't want to get arrested though.

Well look, you know what I mean?

Like, look, people are going to be...

Hey.

This is weird situation.

People are going to be looking at me.

Hey, Jeff, my lawyer.

Hey, quick question.

Excuse me.

I want to take you bothering me with this.

I want to take a hot deuce in public.

Yes.

Where are we visa visa people?

Look, you asked me every day the law was just passed today.

Yes, you could do it.

Okay, cool, cool.

Because I'm going to drop it out.

Oh, you can't over hype.

You can't over hype Cal Solomon.

But Cal is going to be wrapping to us a unique wrap to him and to the world, much like a snowflake.

No wrap is the same.

And he is going to be wrapping about pizza.

Oh, yes.

That's right.

Okay.

So Cal, are you ready to do this?

Are you ready to hit him with a hine?

I mean, is ready to levabay, I guess.

And that is very ready or not ready at all?

Could you even between the two?

You're sweating a lot.

Oh, that is a problem that I have.

You're sweating a lot.

I especially sweat out of my eyelids and sometimes it's called sweat.

It's where I sweat shoots out of my eyelids.

Yes, almost like you're crying in a cartoon.

Yeah.

Well, try not to do that over us.

I'll try not to, but no promises.

All right.

Here it is.

Cal Solomon wrapping about pizza.

Now, pizza wrapped by Cal Solomon.

Here we go.

Have you ever gone over a friend's house to eat and you don't like the pizza they serve?

Because the toppings aren't the ones you like to pet the prony sliding off and you just don't have the nerve to say, I don't like your pizza.

Can I get out of here?

I want to go listen to fun.

I got a comedy pizza party that's happening around and it's got to be number one.

I'm a wrap in Cal.

I like to have a good time.

I like to eat pizza and make some friends.

And between relationship-y-blue.

Blop, blop, blop, blop.

Blop, blop, blop, blop, blop.

Blop, blop, blop, blop, blop, blop, blop, blop.

Listen, I'm in between relationships.

Would you like to have my phone number?

I'd like to go and see the sunrise and know that I'm not alone.

It's throwing me off a little bit.

That thing's about to fall.

That thing's about to fall as it has in every episode I've done in the last.

Sorry, that's probably because I hit it with my chair.

Seems like it's the fifth character.

Cal, so sorry to interrupt.

No, that's all right.

Am I still doing that?

You're in between.

Yeah.

By the way, are you still in it?

Go ahead.

Okay.

Part two.

It beats right back.

I'll finally continue.

So you don't...

So that's no good.

You walk out of the store and you say, I'm still leaving a 15% tip.

You go to your friends and you say, I had a bad pizza experience.

Blop, blop, blop, blop, blop, blop.

Let's go downtown where the party is.

We're going to eat authentic pizza because the water's different here.

It's the way it's made.

You don't eat it with a knife and fork.

This is a guy who was so repugnant.

I didn't like the way he held his pizza.

He looked like a...

A pho...

You know, like a aristocrat and he was too good for the little people and he's eating pizza.

He's just eating pizza like it's...

I don't know.

I didn't like the way he was doing it.

There was something about...

He was blotting it with a napkin and...

Cal?

Yeah.

Can I...

Do you mind if I interrupt for one second?

No, go ahead.

Just one second.

Sure.

And please take no offense at this.

None taken already.

You are correct.

You are not a good rapper.

No.

But you are a fantastic storyteller.

You are a rock-on-tour.

What I just heard was a really interesting story about you seeing a guy blotting his pizza.

It's really interesting what you got to say.

It is.

But your problem is I think you're hung up on the fact that it's got to be in the rap context.

Here's the thing.

And, Jase, you're very generous and I appreciate that.

And thank you for being so positive.

I love the emotional vulnerability of you are between relationships.

It's true.

I thought that was really...

You really have to listen her in.

I really liked that vulnerability is compelling to listen to.

I didn't mean to say that part and I wish I had not put it in there because it's very private personal information.

But now it's out.

I said it into a microphone.

But you had to be honest.

You know, we agree that you were going to be honest.

Yeah, that's true.

I guess.

And I thought that was a...

I thought that was a permission thing.

No, no, you have to...

You have to know...

It's like truth serum.

Yeah.

It's like you invite a...

When you invite a vampire in, that's like...

They just can come and go.

Wait, truth serum like Dr. Ben Carson would use if he was interrogating...

Yeah.

...

No, and he's a doctor.

That's irresponsible.

Can I say, first of all, I wish that there was some sort of intrepid listener out there who would put that to perhaps a sugar hill gang beat.

Or any kind of beat.

Or any kind of beat because I thought it was fantastic.

I would love to hear a list out of this.

I suspect there are many listeners out there who could take that and create really interesting varied songs out of them.

I mean, it's the raw material.

It's like, well, you know, diamonds are made of coal, right?

Oh, that's true.

That's a great lyric.

No one likes listening to that.

No.

So, I think...

I mean, look, is it good?

That's for history to decide that it's not...

Oh, no, it's not.

It's not good.

I could tell as it was happening.

And I think also...

You seem very nervous when you're doing it.

Yeah, you're rubbing your hands together.

Very uncomfortable.

Yeah.

Yeah, I was.

Yeah.

I wasn't comfortable.

And for me, I guess there was a bit of a personal victory because that's the longest I've ever wrapped.

That's the longest?

Really.

...longest of ever gone.

Including when you were with the sugar hill gang.

Oh, for sure.

The sugar hill gang, they would shut that down pretty quickly.

You spent the last 40 years listening to rap?

Like, are you familiar with how it works and operates?

Well, I mean, I know the song Rap is Delight.

Sure.

Do you know any other rap songs?

Well, I mean, it's the template for all rap songs.

So I figured, why should I listen to other rap songs and saw everything you need?

Yeah.

So you've never heard another rap song?

I don't think so.

There's been a long...

I mean, we were talking about the Mount Rushmore of rap.

You've never heard any Jay-Z or Nas or...

I mean, I've heard of...

Sure.

Very famous.

So you know of these...

Did you see the movie, Eight Mile?

Was that the one where Tom Cruise is a race car driver?

No, no, no.

That's Days of Life.

It didn't have Mile even...

Are they Days racing?

No, it didn't have Mile in the title.

That's the one where that poor dead girl hooks up with Eminem and...

A PDG?

You know me.

That's my favorite WB show.

Surely you've seen a movie where there's been a rap song in it.

If there's a party scene on Eurotrip or something like that...

I feel like...

That's your pull Eurotrip?

Look it up.

There probably is one.

What was that movie?

Is it called The Wedding Singer?

Sure.

Yeah.

Where there's a grandmother?

But that's just rapper's delight.

That song is rapper's delight.

So you've seen that movie with rap?

I have seen a movie with a rap in it.

Yeah.

Okay.

Oh, it's great.

Number one, four.

Oh, so good.

So right.

As we found out and it comes up in this episode, Cal Salomon is maybe the only character who's not antagonistic towards you.

Yeah, the one.

And on the tour, that got to be a big grueling, having a fake argument every night.

I really loved when Cal Salomon would be on as I would finally have a little respect.

Cal was...

He was very happy to be there.

Cal is a guy who is very self-aware.

He's got his dreams.

But he's, you know, he is very aware of his limitations.

Sure.

He hopes to get past them.

Sure.

But Cal, look, it's not so good.

Doesn't watch anything with rap in it.

Only The Wedding Singer.

That was...

Now that was...

Here's a little behind the scenes.

Yeah.

That was...

There's a completely happy accident.

Happy Gilmore.

That I knew there was...

Happy Madison.

I should say.

They should call happy accidents happy Madison.

You want to get mad that the characters have an antagonistic relationship with you.

But then you do things like that.

Hey.

But when...

When the idea of...

When Cal was challenged on, you know, being aware of rap and seeing...

Because you just threw it out there.

You threw it out there at one point that you had never...

Anytime you hear a rap, you turned it off or something like that, right?

Or you just had never seen anything with the rap in it.

I think just I had never seen anything with the rap in it.

Right.

And we started listing...

We started listing things that had rap in them.

Is that what it was?

We just heard it.

Yeah.

I...

But...

I pulled The Wedding Singer because I remembered from the trailer that there was a rap in Granny in it.

Yeah.

What I did not know...

Was that she raps?

She raps the light!

Which is...

We can surmise this is the only rap song Cal has ever heard.

Yes.

I mean, you're working on levels that just are subconscious at this moment.

Yes.

You don't even know.

Exactly.

Time of genius is my point.

Speaking of geniuses, let's listen to some geniuses do some ads here.

We need to take a break.

When I say geniuses, I mean myself.

That's right.

Let's take a break when we come back.

We'll have the next episode on your countdown.

The Canada.

Comedy Bang Bang.

We are back here.

Paul of Tompkins clearing his throat after every break.

You won't give me a chance to do it before we come back.

Just let me know.

I say, all right here we go.

Is that not clear enough?

Well, I don't know that you're talking to me.

All right.

Shit.

Okay.

Well, you and Cody might have some sort of deal.

All right.

Let's get to it.

Here we go.

This is episode 13.

Ooh.

Scary.

Boo.

If this were a hotel, I wouldn't stay on this floor.

Hell no.

I wouldn't sit in this seat on an airline flight.

Number one.

Three.

This is an episode.

This is another recent one.

And this is more of the our theory about they vote for the recent episodes.

This is blowing your theory out of the water.

But this is, well, no.

This is proof of the original theory.

This is from October 24th.

This two months ago of this year, just two weeks previous to our previous episode on the countdown.

This is weird.

This is an episode called Pow, Pow Power Wheels.

Yes.

This is Weird Al Yankovic, my co-host and band leader on the comedy bang bang TV show.

Rest in peace.

Not to Weird Al.

Live in kicking, as the simple minds once said.

Let me get a rest in peace in advance for him then.

Okay.

Yeah.

That's the thing.

Why can't we get our rest in pieces before we are already traveling to wherever we're going to travel to?

Yeah.

You know, we should walk around saying that to people instead of hello and goodbye.

What if I never see you again?

Rest in peace.

What is this when people are saying now, I'm most in the last year, rest in power?

What?

Yeah.

Rest in power.

Yes, yes, yes.

What does that mean?

No, but it sounds like it's terrible.

It sounds like the opposite of rest in peace.

Rest in power.

That's terrible.

Guys, rest in peace is fine.

You don't need to, you know, like tinker with it.

It's great.

Rest in power.

It doesn't mean any punch up from you.

And by the way, just to fit R.I.P.

I guess that's really strange.

Like you're going to what?

Like go fight God?

Well, but also you're resting.

Yeah.

That's the other way.

You don't want to be powerful.

Just like go to sleep.

Go to sleep.

That's like one of those people who's like, yeah, I'm such a muscle man that I want to flex while I'm actually sleeping.

One of those people.

You know those people.

One of them.

Yes, of course I do.

So we're now Yankovic, rest in peace and Claudio Adority, rest in peace.

And of course, Jessica McKenna, rest in peace.

Was this her debut?

No, this is not her debut, but this is probably her third episode and the second time for this character that she plays.

Oh, this was the second time.

Second time.

And this was I think the episode that cemented kind of her in the mud.

She is a great improviser and someone that she was on the comedy bang bang TV show a couple of times with whom I'd worked.

And I've been hearing about her improv a lot.

And so we had her on the show and the first episode that she was on the show just blown away by she.

Blown away.

So amazing at like callbacks, I have to say.

Really listens to every single thing even before she comes on.

Yes.

She will call back like 12 things that other people have already said.

And hand in hand with that.

I don't know whether it's the same part of the brain, but also turned out to be a really great freestyle rapper.

The rap on this episode is so good.

I can't imagine it's in the clip.

That's too bad.

It is in the clip.

Yes.

I don't know why we started freestyling, we'll hear the clip, but we just started it.

And I remember I had heard about her being a really good freestyle rapper, but this was not set up.

I just when she started, I went, oh, yeah, I heard that about her.

And then just sat there while she did it on and on and on.

And it was really, really impressive.

And people have to understand from a from a an improv perspective.

Mm-hmm.

Somebody who can go like pretty much the length of an actual song.

It's crazy.

It's insane.

Anyone.

No, I won't even say that.

I don't even think anyone can do one rhyme.

Oh, well, some people can.

No, no, but I was about to say anyone can do one rhyme, but I know some people can't do.

The people, the people on the street, you know, if you were to get a poll, go, hey, do this, do a freestyle rap.

I would say people on the street, six out of ten would not even be able to do one rhyme.

I top out at one rhyme.

Yeah, that's about where I'm at.

And then I'm so relieved that I made it rhyme.

Right.

We really don't have to go ahead.

So for a person to go almost as long as an actual song, it's insane to me.

Yeah.

A lot of people have been clamoring for her and Neil Campbell.

That's right.

And possibly Amy Poehler, if we can ever get her back.

Epic rap.

That would what a rap battle that would be.

Let's listen to this episode Claudia.

Rapid piece.

Rapid power.

We have Claudia O'Dorney is herself.

Of course, she's playing sort of a version of herself as she always does.

The only difference I think is that her mother doesn't like her very much and keeps inventing.

I don't even know if that's a difference.

I can't tell.

I love it's true.

That's true.

But the conceit is that her mother keeps inventing these fake contests to get her away.

To get her away out of Australia.

Yeah.

Just send her away.

She's playing herself, Weird Al, of course, himself, and Jessica is playing a character, a little girl who comes into the studio and she's driving a power wheels, which is a little tiny car.

Her mom works upstairs and she is unsupervised a lot.

Let's hear it.

This is your episode 13.

Number one.

Three.

Do you think that God to bring up the old JC again?

Do you think he calls people up when they're about to die?

He's like, you think like someone?

I think he texts.

He texts.

Yeah.

Oh my God.

Nobody calls anymore.

That's a macabre horror film.

Yeah.

That's a spook.

That's a spook fest right there.

They call it the text.

The text is telling you you're dead.

A text from Jesus telling you you're dead.

You're dead now.

This is a great title.

I love it.

I mean.

You get a text and it's like it's from JC and it goes, you're dead.

Oh my God.

And then you drop dead.

Yeah.

So, a little mochi with a skull.

Oh man.

But would he be like, I love you?

Because you know he loves everyone.

I've heard that about him.

That's one of his main characteristics.

I love your dad or your dad.

I love you.

I think much like money ball, he doesn't want to sugarcoat it.

He just wants to sit someone down and go, you're dead.

He'll be like, you up and then you're dead.

You up, you're dead.

And if you were not up and you don't respond, you can elude it.

He's like, you got it already.

Don't worry.

I'm going to semi-coma.

Pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp.

Look out losers.

Pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp.

Pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp.

Wait a minute.

I think I know what's happening here.

Al Claudia.

Wait.

What was your name?

Is it Beth?

Yeah.

It is.

Thanks Scott.

Hey Beth.

Is Beth.

Her mom works upstairs.

In marketing.

In marketing, yeah.

Not for this company.

Nope.

Do you guys need things marketed?

I hate winning competitions.

I'm trying to get the word out about it.

Okay.

Yeah.

She could do that.

Teeny to do like a publicity tour about winning stuff.

Yeah.

I think that would be cool.

I only come on this show so far.

Pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp.

Is this your new theme song to your power wheels?

What?

This is the same as always.

Pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp.

It seems you've added a musical component to it of a mmm, power wheels, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp, pimp.

It's a power wheels and a minute.

Yeah.

And the wheels.

Watch as it's spinning.

And I'm driving beat, beat.

And I just don't sleep, sleep.

Cause I have nightmares.

Cause all those things that do scare cause we're in the middle of a scary month.

My mom says stop crying.

Okay.

Um, yeah.

That's right.

Here's how I do.

I say food to you.

If you catch the ghost first, then the ghost key is the word.

That ghost, he dies.

He dies twice.

It pews it to the ghost.

I like to do more than pumpkin spice.

Amazing.

Well, Beth, I didn't realize that you could rap when we started that.

Me neither.

I'm growing.

Learning more all the time.

Are you still going to school?

Uh, well, I'm kind of just doing school on a computer right now.

So when you say after school, meaning after the last school you were kicked out of?

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah, after school.

I'm in an after school zone right now.

Okay.

I'm like, oh, I'm going to show you a computer.

What's that?

Uh, just like a virtual teacher who's like, hey, if I have five apples and give you two apples, how many do you shave with?

So if you, so it's using question.

It's after school basically when you close the lid on your laptop.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Interesting.

And it's a virtual teacher.

Yeah.

Like a hologram, like a two-pack hologram.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah.

And you can actually pick what you want.

And I have chosen two-pack.

Oh, really?

That's the dream.

And I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

And I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

Yeah.

I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

And I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

Yeah.

I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

And I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

Yeah.

And I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

Yeah.

And I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

And I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

Oh, I'm going to show you a little bit of it.

Happy!

Pup, pup, pup!

Wheels!

Number one, three.

You got it?

I got it.

Paul just cleared his throat.

That was clear.

How dare you?

I let him clear his throat.

And then Skywit.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Funny, funny shit.

Funny, funny, funny shit.

Oh, funny shit.

My personal relationship with this episode is I was listening to it as I was driving to the set of bajillion dollar properties in Malibu.

The boo.

And the boo.

The channel 101 fans represent.

And it was a day that the production did not seem to be aware, nor was I, that President Obama was visiting Los Angeles.

Oh, oh.

And so all, it was like Sunset Boulevard was completely closed off from end to end.

It's a pretty long street.

Yeah, from end to end.

And so I am driving around trying to find a way in to where I have to go.

Right.

I'm getting very frustrated.

Listening to this episode, which was the only thing keeping me from going on a murderous rampage.

That we hear that a lot, that, you know, it's the only thing that keeps people sane during their rides to work and sometimes during work.

It's really true that I was in such a frustrating situation because I couldn't, I'm trying to communicate with the productions.

And I ended up being an hour late, which was mortifying.

What?

One count, one of your earth hours.

And wait a minute, wait a minute, hold on a second.

Yeah, no, we didn't choose.

Now we're like we both say, uh, huh?

Can I ask you a question?

Can I see you on the kitchen?

Can I see you on the kitchen for a second?

Are you, first off, are you a ten year old boy?

Well, what are you talking about?

Yeah.

Where was the first time you started shaving?

It's shaved this morning.

Okay.

Great.

Okay.

Good.

Covered.

Second question.

Are you an alien?

No, I mean, you have to tell me legally.

I'm documented.

Oh, okay.

Got it.

Build that wall.

Build that lock.

All right.

So anyway, yes, very frustrating situation made a little bit better.

It made it, no, made it a lot better.

It made it so much.

It kept it honestly kept me from just melting down and did your out, did that hour being late?

Did that affect the production at all?

I don't think I had to tell anyone.

I'm going to show it up.

Wherever you want it.

Zero problem.

All right.

Let's go to a break.

When we come back, we're going to hear our first live episode on our countdown.

That's right.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang.

Oh, God.

Damn it.

That's on purpose.

That was on purpose, guys.

Paul of Tomkins here and I'm Scott Ockerman and we're counting down our top 15 episodes of the year.

This is the first episode in the best ofs.

We always, or we have been at least for the past few years, four episodes in a row and we taped them all in one sitting and we get crazier and crazier as we go.

Yeah, come on, guys.

It's not weird.

This is what we do.

There's a precedent that's been established.

By the way, when I saw Duran Duran live.

Duran Duran.

That's what John Taylor said was they played Girls on Film or whatever their last song was.

Everyone started clapping.

Woo, and he said, this is what we do.

Not sure about that.

What?

Like, yes, of course you're applauding.

This is what we do.

It sounds like, is he annoyed by it?

No, are you surprised that this was good?

No, it was bragging.

It was like, of course you're clapping.

I get it.

We make you go crazy.

You go mad, don't you?

That's a spot on John Taylor from Duran Duran.

This is what we do.

We make you go mad.

Hey, speaking of other countries, you're doing an accident from another country.

Speak of one.

Why don't we get to our live episode countdown, the mini countdown within the countdown?

This is episode number four.

Number four.

All right.

We're the most popular.

We did 40 live shows this year.

I believe 39 of them are eligible for this because one of them was in the regular feed, the South by Southwest episode.

The other 39 were eligible for voting and everyone got to pick their top five and we're going to countdown our top four and this is number four.

For this, people had to go, my, the paywall.

Oh, so scary.

So, so scary.

Oh, wait, wait.

You screaming was that a screen that's happening somewhere behind the paywall?

That was behind the paywall.

They sounded like a sound effect.

Yeah.

That is by the way, number nine on our sound effects record.

Oh, finally we're getting closer and closer.

How many tracks altogether?

I believe we said we were going to be doing 99.

The most you can on a CD.

That's a repeat.

All right, this is episode.

This is your top, your fourth most popular live episode and this is from August 1st.

Can you put your mind where you were August 1st?

August 1st.

We recorded this on August 1st.

We were in, I'm going to say we were in Australia.

No, no, no.

Are we in?

We're in Moriel.

Moriel.

Oh.

Oh, Pepe.

Pepe Lefron.

Greed.

Ziegyle.

Montreal.

This is Montreal.

Now this is an episode.

It was you, Lauren Lapkis, Nick Kroll and John Mulaney.

A great group.

Gigi.

This one I remember.

It was, this was the first of the shows where it was very difficult to hear anyone else on stage.

That's right.

It was over the entire tour where it was very difficult to hear and this one.

It is a testament to how funny everyone is that we cannot hear each other at all.

Unless, unless someone's face was pointed directly at you.

Which is not the case when you're performing.

You don't want to see a bunch of people in profile looking directly at each other.

Because we're all seen.

Been glorious.

Been glorious, poppin' jays.

But it is a testament to how funny this episode is and how much people liked it that even though we couldn't hear each other, the recording of it is very funny and everyone is very funny.

Now you are playing Big Chunky Bubbles.

Which Big Chunky Bubbles was a, that was born on tour.

Born on tour.

That was born minutes before a show.

That's right.

We were at a restaurant and something on a menu at the restaurant we were at right before the show.

It was a description of an item, some kind of stew or something.

Big Chunky Bubbles.

And you said, oh I should be a character called Big Chunky Bubbles.

We said, great.

And then minutes later you were.

That's pretty much it.

And it has become a staple of the show.

Big Chunky Bubbles maybe dislikes me more than any of the other.

He's a very unpleasant guy.

He doesn't like any.

He doesn't like any of the other.

So I shouldn't take it personally.

You should not.

The other ones I do.

Don't take it personally.

Yeah, I understand.

But he is, yeah he's an unpleasant guy.

This is Big Chunky Bubbles and Lauren is playing Pamela from Big Bear who is an insane person.

A lethal combination.

Two terrible people.

And then we have of course, Nick Kroll and John Mulaney and they're playing their characters Gill and George from The Oh Hello Show.

Which is currently on Broadway.

Correct.

And taking The Great White Way by Storm.

It sure is.

And people love them and this has a lot of riffing with them together and just imagine us straining to understand what they're saying.

Here's what was great though.

When John and Nick came out it took the pressure off needing to hear because they just talked and talked.

I was like, oh okay.

I honestly, I don't mean that as a slam.

No, it's not a slam.

I realized literally you're relieved.

Oh this is great.

Okay, they'll just go.

Because the three of us Lauren, you and me had been having such trouble trying to figure out what we were saying.

I believe you may have came out first and we, you and I could at least talk to each other because we started.

You can't have Pamela from Big Bear come out first ever.

Yeah.

She's an insane person.

But you and I talked for a good 20-25 minutes I believe and we were trying to face each other as much as we could and so we did an okay job and then Pamela came out and we couldn't hear what she was saying at all.

We were like, oh fuck what is going to happen?

By the way, this would all be easily solved by monitors that were turned up and pointed at us.

Apparently in the Montreal Comedy Festival just for laughs, not just for monitors.

Got to put that in the writer bra.

It is in the writer.

It's in the writer bra.

They don't call it just for monitors.

They call it just for laughs.

They do or don't call it just for monitors.

They do not.

Okay.

JFL, not JFM.

Mm hmm.

So when Nick and John came out it was such a relief to us of like, oh these guys know their characters so well and they're so in the pockets.

They'll never stop talking.

And they don't stop talking and they're really funny while they do it.

We could just sigh and go, guys have at it.

It was like a working vacation.

It really was.

So let's hear it.

This is your number four.

Number four.

Did we already mention what a great group this is?

This is a solid group.

It's such a great group.

Honestly, usually you guys are losers and nobody's.

But this is a real who's who.

Yeah.

I don't know whether you're talking about us on stage or them out there.

I can't.

Who?

You?

No, I know we're up here.

What are you talking about?

These people.

No, they're talking about the sea.

They're talking about the sea.

Pamela, yeah.

Yeah, great.

And this is fun.

JFL.

Why do you keep sniffing?

What?

Oh, we did it by Chick-A-Kane.

Yeah.

We did this real step down cocaine that comes from this real mud mud real nice.

This real mud real nice man shit.

Oh God.

They bring it down.

They tow it from Edmonton in the snow and then they step on it with gasoline.

So it's just real yellow.

Get you in the fucking brake.

This guy had a great, this guy had a great flit brim smish mouth hat.

And it was cool.

He had it to do all over his calf and he had a bad vibe.

So we bought a punch of shitty coke from him.

How long have you been in town?

I mean, you guys are obviously.

Well, we're here.

We're here for his career, which the JFL, which is a wonderful, two weeks of French comedy and two weeks of good comedy.

And don't know that I agree with that.

We keep traditional French clowning because it's god awful and stupid.

Yeah.

No, no, no.

It's great when there's just a perverted man.

But if he doesn't speak, it's adorable.

I know.

I want to when a clown pretends to be bit in the butt and they grabbed a little tush.

I mean, who doesn't just double over at that?

But we're here for just fast.

We're here for just fast.

You're performing that.

Just fast.

Well, we're fans, but we also perform.

We do acapella, just music.

Yeah, we write lyrics to jazz hits.

Oh, OK, I'd love to hear somebody.

We want to hear Birdland by right there.

Oh, yeah.

Birdland.

You want to join in?

You welcome them?

Yeah, it does be.

Choco was a good friend of ours.

Where did you meet him?

We used to pick fights with bouncers too.

Yeah, of course everyone here is familiar with late 70s and early 80s.

Just fusion base player, Jago Pastoreas.

We got a beat sheet backstage and we knew the third bit should be about Jago Pastoreas.

We know how to open and do things.

Where is a millennial podcast or the inskinin' on more about than 70s and 80s, just fusion bases who died because he picked a fight with a bouncer.

With a bouncer in Florida.

And, but we get choked up about famous people who died because we wanna make it about us.

A lot of people have died this year.

A lot of people have died and we always Instagram and we go, we knew their work.

Look at me.

Look at this, because even though those people are dead in Dornab, they would just love to know that you stole a gany image and put it on Instagram.

Oh, think of me today because I like this guy's work.

Oh, God.

For them to know that you tweeted while they're at dead body.

What a joy it would bring them.

Did you know anyone like David Bowie?

I mean, he lived in New York.

He lived in New Bowie.

Oh, we did Bowie.

He valued his privacy and we would blow it up whenever we could.

We'd go, Bowie's house, that's where Bowie lives.

And I'd throw little pebbles at night like Romeo.

And I'd go, Bowie, come here, kiss me.

Wait, just to crack, it was like little Romeo, the music artist.

Like little Romeo.

I go, come here.

Mr. P's son.

He's Mr. P's son.

Right, yes, of course.

And that was, I think, because there's a stalker.

We have no limits.

Yeah.

Did he ever have occasion to come outside ever?

And Bowie, of course.

Yeah.

No, no, because I was out there making, I go, kiss me, kiss me.

If you buy, kiss me, you know?

If you're bi, kiss me.

Yeah, if you're so famously bi, why don't you come out and mooch me, prick?

You know, I was real aggro about it, you know?

That's a little intense.

Yeah, come here.

Fuck you, give me kiss.

Did you even want a kiss?

No, no, I'm no queer, come on.

All right, OK.

Hey, I mean, even in juvie, I didn't turn sissy.

I did.

Why were you in juvings?

Yeah, but there was this fire, you know?

And I was there with the gas can taking credit.

Taking credit.

Yeah, yeah, I burned down this school.

FU.

Just to give yourself three credits?

Yeah, this was three years ago.

This was three years ago.

But they sentenced me to juvie, because I went, I don't know right from room.

It was where it should pass.

Yeah, it was where it should pass.

I look ridiculous.

And you were shaved, probably presumably the fourth.

No, no, no, no, no.

Really?

No, I just, I did a flesh colored makeup on my beard.

You put on the makeup?

On my illness beard.

This is an illness beard, because I had a heart attack.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

It was fun.

It was great.

I grabbed my arm at the restaurant, and Gil knew what to do.

Yeah.

What did you do?

I got more bread.

I love bread.

I talk about it all the time on dates.

Yeah, on dates.

OK, yeah, you wanted to know what's in me about me?

I mean, well, I love free bread.

Who's dating here, huh?

Anyone dating out there?

Oh, my god.

My god, my god.

Yeah, yeah.

The guy with the Supreme, the guy with the Supreme had the front row.

He clapped it up.

He's clapped.

He's got a backpack under his chair.

He does.

Where are you backpacking to later, sir?

We fuck it.

The pool party says.

Yeah, right.

I bet that's not going to be too good to keep interacting with him.

Yep, not returning to that well.

But you know, we're going down to Rio next week, and we're nervous.

Yeah.

We have to narrow for the Olympics.

Yeah, we're going down to the Olympics.

Yeah, we're big chasers.

We want to get Zika.

You're bug chasers.

We're big chasers.

Yeah.

Back in the bad houses, we go, give me, give me, give me, because we were little big chasers.

Yeah, we were big chasers.

And so we want to go down there because I got this fitted hat, but it's too small for me.

Yeah.

So I'm open to catch that Zika.

I'm open to catch a Zika pin this head right up so that I can.

Yeah.

So I can get into this expose hat.

I got this fitted child's expose hat.

With the flat brim.

Yeah, of course.

I'm going to keep the tag done.

But it's too small right now.

Yeah.

So I'm hoping I go down the rear.

Because right now, if you get that Zika, you get that little peanut head.

Yeah.

And you can wear like any like I'm a seven and three quarters.

Are you fitted ball cap?

Yeah.

So I'm going to get down to a two.

Yeah.

Get a little pin head like these Brazilians.

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, we're going to go down.

We're we're doing the opening ceremony, which will be us being released from kidnapping.

Yeah.

We're hoping to get kidnapped by some of these favela monsters.

And you know.

How are you going to entice them into kidnapping you?

Are you going to advertise?

Give me kiss.

Fuck you.

I'm going to go down the go pick up and a bitch go hey you little dirt boy rats.

I got cash on me.

Kiss.

But honestly, what is cuter than like a nine year old with a machine gun?

Yeah.

That Olympics is going to be awesome.

Yeah.

It's going to rule.

Yeah.

Dash will be there.

Dash.

Maybe.

Oh, they hate it, man.

I read an article that they hate being called dash.

They get so steamed.

Yeah.

It seems like we wouldn't want to provoke them by calling them.

Yeah.

Screw that man.

It's like you were always saying Scott I hate Isis.

Oh, no.

Oh, no, no.

No, no, no.

I have no opinion one way or the other.

You have no opinion.

You neutralize.

That's neutral.

Yeah, that's cool, man.

They fucking hate it, dude.

If you come dash for real though, no kidding aside.

They freak out like Frank Costanza.

Really?

You got to see these guys.

They don't air those videos.

Are you going to try to take in any of the events at the Olympics?

Yeah.

Oh, sure.

We're going to go see the Swimming.

Yeah.

Swimming, really?

Yeah.

You got that one dude Michael Phelps.

Is that?

Fish man, yeah.

Fish face, yeah.

Yeah, we sold him some awful weed.

Yeah.

You know, we sold him some real crap stuff, some real brown stuff.

He smoked it right.

I mean, he didn't give a help.

There's going to be a lot less bang videos without this vaping now, don't you think?

I think so.

Yeah.

Vaping has really taken the place of the bombs.

And I feel like these bang videos that, you know, for years, swimmers would get caught on a bang video and, or I guess maybe it happened once.

But either way, it was the downfall of many great swimmers.

And now they can vape quietly and blow it into their shirt.

That's what I do with my farts.

I fart and then I go, you blow.

Well, first of all, it's coming up the opposite part of your body.

No, no, no, no, I fart out of my dick.

Pamela, Pamela knows her.

You're finally speaking a Pamela's language.

That's why I feel good when you fucking...

Pamela, you've got such a strong voice.

Thank you.

I think that you guys would get along.

You guys are very similar.

Totally.

Yeah.

Pamela, if you ever want to leave Big Bang, you want to come live in which stock is something like that.

It's a simple...

Come up this sorghurties.

You're offering me a place this day?

Yeah, sure.

I mean, we don't have a place but sure we're offering you a place this day.

Where do you guys actually live?

Where do you reside during the year?

73rd.

Yeah, 73rd.

Calambas.

Yeah, come on.

We said different Chris Streets, but it's fine.

You know, we each see the apartment in a different way.

Y'all share a bed?

Yeah, we share a Murphy bed.

It's a Murphy Brown bed.

Nice.

What do you say when you say Murphy Brown?

It's just got held in his ear.

Yeah, held in his ear.

We did that thing where we put tape in the middle of the apartment.

Oh, you did.

One side is...

Yes, yes, yes.

And then it's my side.

Yeah.

This was a fight episode.

Oh, yeah.

Did you end up just both of you on one side and no one goes over to the other side?

Yeah, eventually.

Yeah, the bedroom was on my side.

Yeah, no, after I drew the line, I went, uh-oh.

You know, the bedroom and the kitchen and the bathroom.

Everything.

And meanwhile, I'm backed in a corner.

With this goddamn possum.

You were with the possum?

Yeah, I was with the possum.

I thought it was Tim Petty, so I invited him over.

And then he goes, wait, by the way, I'm a possum.

I go, oh, Jesus.

And it's talking possum.

No, it turned out to be Ringo Starr.

Yeah.

I thought it was Tim Petty.

Claims he's a possum.

Turns out to be...

None other piece in love Ringo Starr.

Piece in love Ringo Starr.

No more autographs Ringo Starr.

That's a shame he's not doing any more of those autographs, you know.

It is a shame because we got so many glosses sent to him.

Because we love the Beatles, man.

Yeah, the one interesting thing about us is we love the Beatles.

Yeah.

Just like everyone else in the world.

Yeah, it's an interesting specific fact about us.

It's different with us.

Who's your favorite Beatles?

I would have met people at Manson.

Charles Manson.

Because he was like so committed to the music that he totally misinterpreted it.

We were bros with the whole Manson family.

Yeah, we were in that group because they had these sweet eights and nimes and these brunettes.

There's nothing like a broken nine.

Number four.

Oh, great stuff.

Great stuff.

What an episode.

Tell you what, let's take a break.

When we come back we'll have our final episode that we're going to countdown of this, our first installment of The Best ofs.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're here with me.

With Paul of Tomkin.

And with you.

Scott Augerman.

That's your name.

That is me.

And here let's get to it.

Let's get to your episode number 12.

Let's do it, man.

Number one.

Two.

All right.

Well, zig-zaming, zig-zaming, which is a cross between zig-zagging and examining.

What am I trying to say?

What?

Zig-zaming.

Was it the cartoon about the little alien?

Zig-zam?

I don't know.

What little alien are you talking about?

How about the Martian Invader Zam?

Oh, Invader Zam, yes.

Which Daniel Canig wrote for?

And just, by the way, wrote an issue of the Invader Zam comic book in stores now.

Well, there you go.

That's right.

Little plug for the hilarious Daniel Canig.

This is an episode zig-zagging from later in the year.

This is now back towards the beginning of the year.

This is February 8th.

And this is episode 400.

Right.

Oh, that's like a milestone episode.

That's a milestone episode.

No, that's a milestone episode.

And on the hundreds, we've been having two people.

That's right.

Jason Manzukas, the aforementioned Jason Manzukas and Andy Daley.

We've been getting together.

I think we did episode 200, episode 300, and episode 400 together.

Sounds about right.

100 was Rob Hubel and Tom Lennon coming back.

The original from the first episode.

The very first episode.

Yes, that's right.

And so, but then on 200, 300, and 400, it's been Jason J.

Dog, Manzukas, and Andy Daley.

And this is an episode called The War on Surfing.

Did I say that?

You did not tell that.

The War on Surfing.

And this is Andy Daley doing his character Hot Dog.

Hot Dog is an older gentleman who he likes to water ski.

And he water skis on sausages, very long sausages instead of skis.

And we find out that in this episode, he hates surfers and there's some sort of war going on.

Yeah, Hot Dog also worth mentioning.

Yeah, oh, very worth mentioning because it'll come up.

Huge fan, huge fan of the musical group, Shana Na.

Shana Na.

And has been auditioning to be a member of Shana Na for most of his life.

He's one of those people who can't just be a fan of something.

He wants to be a part of it.

Exactly.

Don't get me started on fan theories and how much I despise them.

But do you think there are fan theories about this show?

Yeah, I do.

I think there's fan theories about everything.

Yeah, there probably are.

About what Hot Dog's up to or what's going to be next with the Bible.

The Bible.

What a fan I am of the Bible as well.

Big fan.

Two Corinthians.

You know those comic conventions for the Bible they have every Sunday?

Yup.

Sometimes people come in costume.

That's so funny.

That's how popular the Bible is.

There's cons every week.

Yeah, not just during the summer.

No, not once a year.

All over the country.

Incredible.

All right, this is Hot Dog is going to reveal some very interesting things.

And yeah, let's hear it.

This is the War on Surfing.

This is your episode 12.

You're at a crossroads in your life as far as I'm concerned.

I mean, do you go on?

I mean, is there anything left for you to do here?

I mean, do your thoughts turn to depression at all at this time in your life?

You know, I mean.

Here's what I'll say.

As a man who spends his days weeping at the Burbank airport until he is let go early, who has been kicked out of the band Nashasha that he started.

That is true.

Everyone told unequivocally.

By every single person he's ever met.

That he will never get into Shana now.

What are you living for?

I mean, I guess it's that you haven't been dead against surfers.

So which is.

There's that is that enough?

I am actively involved in a war.

I'm actively fighting a war against surfers.

But you're not on the front line.

I got a motorcycle.

As I said, I'm nine months deep into taking part of the second.

So there's that.

And I am going to be a member of Shana now.

I'm not talking.

You're not.

I'm going to be a member of Shana.

It's not happening.

They got a gig coming up March 5th up in Niagara Falls, New York at the Seneca Casino.

I'm going to be there.

Great.

But you can audition.

You can be a fan of Shana.

Of course.

You're not interested in being a fan of Shana now.

You will be a fan for the rest of your life.

You will never say the phrase, Hi, I'm a member of Shana and I am the treasurer.

Yeah.

Oh, I wouldn't want to be the treasurer.

Wait, what position do you want to hold?

I would like to be the secretary's member for that.

Oh, really taking down all the minutes for the Shana now meetings?

Let me ask you this.

Have you ever thought about attempting to join the organization of Shana in an administrative position?

Yeah, manager.

An assistant, a road manager.

Roadie.

I wouldn't want to get that close to my dream and not be attaining it.

That would drive me crazy, you know.

Oh, man.

But don't worry, you guys.

Don't worry.

All hot dogs are going to pull it out in the end.

I don't think you are.

I'm going to pull it out in the end.

How much longer do you think you have on this earth?

Me on the planet earth.

So you know that the earth is a planet?

It's just what it's called, the planet earth.

So you think it's just a name?

The name of the proper, a proper noun.

The planet earth you think is the name of what we live on.

The name of the country we live on is the planet earth.

Country we live on.

Right?

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

No, that checks out.

How much longer do you have, do you think?

I'd say I probably got another 80 to 90 years.

With the singularity or something?

Are you a Highlander?

No, no.

I don't know.

You think you're going to be a hundred and...

Oh, don't...

It's funny.

How old do people in your family live?

Is it funny I asked if you're a Highlander?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Because there was a time when I thought I might have been.

I'm not.

Oh, yeah.

What happened?

I cut off a guy's head and I didn't get any of his powers or anything like that.

Oh, okay.

Hey, I want to talk about this.

What happened?

Yeah, how did that happen?

That's not that interesting.

What year was that interesting?

It was right after the movie Highlander came out.

Literally, I walked out of the theater.

You're like, hey, here's a test.

There can be only one and cut a man's head off.

Well, they kind of like that.

Who was the man?

Was he a ticket taker?

I shouldn't talk this much because when...

Time's when I've talked about this, somebody said, hey, you're going to get arrested for that.

So I should talk too much about it.

I mean, that movie came out a while ago with the statute of limitations.

Well, there's no statute of limitations on murder.

That's what I've got.

But was it murder?

In the sense that, yes, that the person was killed and he's not in self-defense or anything like that.

And he meant to do it.

Oh, no, that is murder.

So four thought and whatnot.

Yes.

Yeah.

And then that's it.

So this is pre-planned too because did you have the sword with you?

No, I did not have a sword.

So you had to go in.

But I knew I could get one.

And so I went and I got a sword.

How far away was the sword?

The sword?

Well, interesting.

I saw the movie about roughly 10 or 12 blocks away from a shop where they sell novels and stories.

Like a Dungeons and Dragons.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, awful T-sorts.

So not even a real functional sword.

Well, it did fine.

And it served its function quite well.

It was after I was, I had to break into that store, steal the sword.

Oh, so we're just adding charges to this.

Yeah.

Well, I'm sure the statute of limitations on the B&E are done.

I think this is actually pretty interesting.

Whose head did you cut off?

Can we talk about it?

It was a Scottish guy that I knew that I just thought, you know, just because of the Scottish thing in the movie and whatever.

You're not that interesting.

The point is I'm not a high one.

Okay, great.

But you still think you're going to live to be a hundred and sixty seventy years old?

I haven't done the math, but I have to.

People in your family tend to live long lives.

No, this is the longest anyone in my family.

It's ever lived.

All of your, really, everyone's gone.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Really?

No one's ever made it to.

Have you sired any children?

Sixty.

Oh, I don't think that I have.

You don't think so.

I don't think that I have.

No.

I mean, you're out there having a raw dog sex with people in the parking lot.

That's true.

I've had a lot of unprotected sex.

A lot of girls that I've had with have become pregnant.

Oh.

And they're had children.

Hang on.

But I don't think I've ever had any children.

Hang on, man.

Hey, no, man.

Those might be your kids.

That song is catching on.

That's not such as a hit song.

I think that you might have children.

Those might be your kids.

Hot dog.

Um, I doubt it.

Really?

Do you know any of them as growing?

I mean, are they grown up now?

Are they still young babies?

How old are these kids that your former flames?

That's funny.

Yeah, I know a few of the kids that's on my old girlfriend's gave birth.

Yeah.

Anyway, what are they like?

What are they?

Well, none of them can water ski where it's a shit.

Oh, okay.

So those aren't my parents.

So that's interesting.

I would pass that down genetically to water ski.

Have they tried though?

Um, no.

And you know what?

Actually, though, I have to tell you, one of these kids that we're talking about right now is actually he is a water skier, but he's a freshwater water skier.

Oh, no.

Fucking kid of mine would ever be a fresh water skier.

What is his name?

His.

His name is Oscar.

Oscar.

What's his last name?

I asked you.

All right.

Well, if I asked you this, if I could give you, if I could grant you a wish and it was one of these, one of these two things, not a genie, because I am.

Would you rather be given the ability to issue a swift, shameful victory?

Mm.

To the surfer.

I mean, a victory for the water skiers over the surfer is that is unending and definitive.

Oh, they could never top it.

They could never top it.

Yeah.

For eons and centuries to come everyone would know a water skiing.

Hot dogs.

Yes.

Victory.

Oh my God.

Or be a child.

Or be a child not for one day and not even a performing day.

Wait, no, let them have.

No, I want to see.

I want to see.

I want to build it out from here.

Just one day.

No doubt in my mind that if I put an end to surfing forever, the guys in Sean and I would let me in the band.

Wow.

So you want to do the surfing thing?

Every single thing is in service of getting into Sean and I'm absolutely, absolutely.

It is my one and only goal.

Do they, to the guys in Sean and I even like surfing?

I don't know, but that would be some achievement to be able to say that I put it into surfing.

But here's the thing though.

I don't think, here's, I will say this in a very controversial way.

Oh yeah.

For you, hot dog.

I don't think Sean would let someone into the band who was a murderer.

Oh, but that wasn't murder.

We just established it.

But it was more of a long of just a test to see whether I was a Highlander.

Sure.

And I could get it.

But we just talked about how it was.

It was murder and you agreed.

Premeditated.

Well, let's just cut that part out.

Oh, that would be good.

All right.

I'll make a note of this.

Well, speaking of murder, actually, this is the reason I came here.

Oh, finally.

This was the reason because several people sent me an article because people know about my interest in Shana now.

Okay.

And this blew my mind and was very upsetting to me that there's this guy by the name of Edward Solly.

You heard about this story?

No, I haven't heard of this guy.

Edward Solly.

How do you spell his name?

So, Lolly.

Solly, Lolly.

Got it.

Edward Solly.

Yep.

Now, here's the story.

Like Solly, Solly, Solly, get your adverbs here.

Thanks, Jake.

Like that.

Schoolhouse Rock, everybody.

Right about the time of the Highlander incident.

Okay.

So, the 82 or something.

Something in there.

I wanted to get out of town just I wanted to see a different part of the country.

Sure.

Right around that time.

Yeah.

And I heard just through the grapevine, through the Shana and I grapevine, that Vinnie Taylor.

Did you hear it through the grapevine or did you hear it through the grapevine?

No, I heard it through the grapevine.

Okay.

So, the Vinnie Taylor.

Yeah.

Right?

Vinnie Taylor.

Right?

You say that like we should know who that is.

You got to know Vinnie Taylor.

He played guitar for Shana and I from 71 to 74.

Wait, I thought Shana and I was in a cappella band.

No, well, I mean the main guys that you know of is the guys from Shana and I are really singers and bands primarily.

But there's a backing band.

There's a band.

Okay.

Vinnie Taylor.

So, it's like those guys are full-fledged members of Shana and I.

It's like Shana and I was the news.

Oh.

So, sure.

And you've never tried to get into Shana and I as a musician.

Oh, no.

I learned how to play almost every instrument under your son and it cannot be done.

Really?

Is it your fingers that are so calloused and from taking apart those motorcycles?

Yeah, I got motorcycle taking apart fingers.

I don't have musicians fingers.

That's just how it is.

Yep.

You know your fingers?

No, thyself.

Yeah.

And I don't understand music as well.

Oh, so.

Well, that's going to be tough for you as a singer as well.

No, I don't agree.

But anyway, so I found out that Vinnie Taylor who died in 1974.

Okay.

Is that why he left the group?

That's why they wouldn't have him in the group anymore after he had died.

Oh, wow.

Which is, you know, right there in the bylaws.

Yeah.

If one dies, one can no longer be a member of Shana.

It's one of the first rules.

So, but I heard that he did not die, that he had faked his own death and was living in Orlando, Florida and was down there performing and I, as Danny C, he was going by and I was like, I'm going to go down there and he is going to tutor me to teach me how to be a man.

Holy cow.

Isn't that interesting?

I'm going to go to the tutelage right up until 2001.

Well, so we're talking like 25 years ago.

No, it was like 16, 17 years.

Wow.

That I was under the tutelage of Danny C. And then I never knew what happened to him.

He just kind of took off one day and whatever.

Well, you know, and I turned up for the lesson.

He wasn't there.

Okay.

So I didn't know what happened to him.

I figured whatever.

He moved on with his life.

I'll move on with mine.

I haven't thought about him in years.

Okay.

Turns out now you could Google this.

You could Google Edward Solly.

Okay.

Well, he wasn't Vinny Taylor.

His guy, this guy's name was Edward Solly.

And he was a murderer who had escaped from jail and was living at fraudulent Lee as a former member of Shana.

Oh, he taught me everything I know about being a member of Shana.

Okay.

He taught me how to sing.

He taught me how to audition for Shana.

Now, every single time I go into a Shana.

No, addition.

You do the solly.

All I'm doing is stuff that Solly taught me.

I am 100% a Solly.

A Solly.

I trained Shana.

Oh, no.

So this is bad news.

It's very upsetting news, but at the same time, maybe this is something.

This is a part of me that says, does this wipe clean the slate of all of those auditions and allow me to come back and audition 50 more times?

This time.

Unsullied.

Wow.

Can I ask you a question?

Did Solly teach you anything else other than the Solly method?

Oh, God.

I mean, over the years, I mean, I was, yeah, I was like his apprentice and all things.

I learned a lot.

All things.

What was he arrested for?

I believe arrested for child murder.

Well, yeah, he did murder a child.

Okay.

Look, I mean, we've all got things in our past.

Sure.

Did you, can I ask you this?

Uh-huh.

Did you see the movie Highlander with anybody?

Did I see with anybody?

Yeah.

There was a group of us.

Yeah.

Cool.

Okay.

Just run down some names here.

I don't know if Solly was there or not.

I don't know if I met him after or before.

I just am wondering if like you also took after him in murder the way that you took after him and sing it.

Yeah.

I don't know.

We've talked about this one guy you've murdered.

Is that the only person you've ever.

Oh, I see what you're saying.

You're doing the time that I was with Solly because he was a murderer.

Did I answer it?

Were you just trying to get a fuller picture of what the Solly method is?

Are you a roving, rampaging man?

No, no, no.

At that time I would only have killed somebody if Solly told me to or whatever or if it was somebody that he wanted.

You know what I'm saying?

He wanted.

Yeah.

How many times would that ever happen?

Oh, I don't know.

I mean, in 16 years, we're talking about different people who kind of like he had a beef with or whatever.

Yeah.

Who knows?

40, 50 people.

Wow. Oh my goodness.

Are you saving this till the end of the show?

We don't have time for any follow-up.

No, we don't.

But that is a really juicy reveal.

Yeah.

I don't agree.

Juicy?

He's got beef with him.

Oh, you're making me hungry hot dog.

For hot dogs.

Yeah.

Wow.

Yeah.

Well, we'll have to follow up on this another time and we have to.

We have to bring it to you.

It's nothing to follow up on.

Really?

Yeah.

Names, locations of the bones.

Oh, no.

None of that is all that interesting.

We were out there on the water.

You were on the water.

So just toss them off the side.

Okay.

Were you in international water?

I believe so.

Okay.

Where's anyone else out there with you?

A few of the people.

Okay.

Yeah.

We got it.

Let's run down some names of them.

Oh, no.

No, it's all right.

It's all right.

Yeah.

We're getting perilously close to revealing my name before it was hot dog.

I don't want to do that.

Okay.

All right.

Number one, two.

Oh, what a revelation.

What a revelation.

He's not a Highlander.

Made by the real convicted murderer at word, Solly.

Now, Jason and Andy, I think I'm doing each other for a long time from probably back in New York.

Yeah, I would say so.

They both, UCB, New York people.

And Jason is a mischievous character.

He's a devil.

He's a little devil.

He's a little stinker.

But I think he takes a particular delight in putting traumstacles in the paintings daily into a corner.

Yes, that's true.

Because Andy is one of those people who can get out of those corners expertly.

Yes.

He ever like trap an animal in a corner and it's so fun because they usually get out.

But you know those times where the animal is trapped and knows it's going to die.

That's not as fun.

No, it's not fun because you see the look on their face where they just say, I have to say my fate.

Yeah.

Mama.

I'm no longer in control of my stupid instincts.

Mm-hmm.

I submit.

Do what thou will, sir.

You know how, and then of course you kill the animal.

Like, crush it skull.

Yes, of course.

These are flies we're talking about, by the way.

Flies and raccoons.

But I'll do it with a handle of a tennis racket.

Sure, sure.

It's either one.

Flies and raccoons.

Yep.

Good for both.

All the same to me.

That's the spalding promise.

Good for both.

Great episodes.

Great episode.

And we have to wrap it up here for this particular episode of The Best ofs.

Sad.

It is sad.

Every ending is sad.

What's not sad is the fact that we have another episode coming out this Thursday.

So just wait a few mere days and we will be back to Countdown episode 11, 10, 9, and 8 in the Countdown.

And that's even more exciting because they get better and better.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, I guess they do, right?

Mm-hmm.

They do.

Yeah.

Yeah, that makes sense.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I think I get this now.

I don't think I got it until just right now.

This is the eighth year that you've been doing.

Nobody's more embarrassing than I am.

I'm embarrassed for you.

I thought why are we listening to these out of order?

They're in a very specific miracle order.

That's God, I get that now.

Okay.

Jesus, I admit it.

I'm wrong.

Well, what do you want from me?

I want you to apologize.

I am sorry to you.

Thank you.

That's all I want.

The listener.

You don't want me to finish.

Oh, fuck you.

I'm going to finish.

I'm going to let you finish.

So many let me finish memes in the world.

There's the Ross Perot.

There's the Kanye.

The Ross Perot.

That's the real.

You're going to finish.

Oh, right.

We're going to wrap it up here.

We'll see you on Thursday.

And there may be a special surprise on Thursday's episode.

Don't want to say what it is, but we will- Cupcakes?

No.

I did bring some brownies.

We picked it out on them right before they did have a pig out session.

Yep.

Let's wrap it up there for now, but we'll see you on Thursday.

All right.

Thanks.

Bye.
