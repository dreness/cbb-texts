♪ I am walking here. Welcome to Comedy Death, right in New York City!

Oh my goodness!

Live at the UCB Theater New York!

It is Comedy Death, right? I am very pleased to be here in the lovely UCB Theater.

The New York edition, which I've been here once. It's fantastic.

A great New York crowd, about 150 strong. Thank you so much for coming out.

I want to introduce my co-host who's sitting to my left here.

He'll be here for the entire program. He is a master storyteller, first of all.

Yet he never does that in his act. Instead he tells jokes, but he's one of the best at that as well.

Please welcome Todd Barry, everyone!

Oh my goodness! An impromptu response!

That was crazy!

First I think I'm just going to be a guest and then you say, oh by the way, you're co-hosting.

This must be the best day of your professional career.

That's really good, and I guess I can't leave early like I planned.

How are you my friend? It's great to see you.

Welcome to New York City.

Thank you very much. I love it here. It's a little cold lately. It's snowed today.

Did it?

Yes, were you not up that early?

I'm just too busy riding. I don't know.

Take us through the riding process, Todd!

It's too intense. I'll start crying.

No, it's great here. It is a little too cold for me. I think they should build one of these in LA personally.

Great food in New York, though. What did you eat so far?

I had, you have a bit about Mexican food, but I'm going to ask.

No, but I had great Mexican food yesterday. A place called Chai Potley or something like that.

Only in New York. Only in...

Why are you so... Okay, I'll take that out.

Todd just took... I mean, if anyone described the scene for the homeless...

Oh my God, it's standing for me, right?

Todd, thank you were at my first live show in Vancouver to about ten people.

There's about ten people in a hotel conference here.

We have a better crowd today.

The pro that I am, I still, you never would have known.

That I was performing for ten people.

Except for the 60 times I mentioned it.

In a ten minute set.

So you have been a guest?

That was supposed to be five minutes.

You have been a guest on two of my bonus episodes, and I thank you for that.

And you actually helped out a lot here with some of the booking today.

I did the booking. I'm doing the co-hosting.

I ran a disc repair on your alarm.

Was that Norton's antivirus, or what did you use there?

I know that's technical.

I got these painfully uncomfortable chairs.

Now why is it that the theater has such uncomfortable chairs?

They actually call these theater chairs.

Like I ask them once because I do a lot of stuff at the LA theater, and they have these very same chairs, and I remember Zach Elle Finakis put his foot through the bottom of one during a performance.

And they're like $150 to...

What was he angry about?

Having a charmed life.

I was like, being a fat bearded weirdo who looked into fame.

Now these don't look like theater chairs to me.

No, that is the technical term for them, is theater chairs.

I asked them, I said, when you order them, what do they call it?

But to be fair, this doesn't look like a theater to me.

That's true.

Whoa.

A lot of people very...

Yeah, that chilled the room.

Can you delete that using your computer?

Yeah, I know, you've got it.

So, let's see, a lot of times on the show we start by talking about what's in the news, what's happening.

I'm too busy doing benefit shows to know what's on my news.

Oh, that's right.

What do you benefit in lately?

Earthquake benefits people.

Really?

Earthquakes.

What types of earthquakes?

I don't get into what types.

You say earthquake and show, and I'm there.

You're the first person people think to call when you hear the word.

No more than 10 minutes in material.

Now, I read this on the plane.

I don't know if any of you have this.

Oh, look at that.

But this is the new Rolling Stone with John Mayer on the cover shirtless as is his won't.

Showing off his beautiful tattoos.

He's got a sleeve, Todd.

Would you agree?

He does.

Yeah, the number 77.

Was that when he was born in 77?

No, that's his favorite Sunset Strip, actually.

You're a New York now, Scott.

Sorry.

These LA show business jokes aren't going to fly here.

No, but I read an interesting part of this which it said that he was shy growing up and that he used to have to cancel dates because of his horrible acne.

And I felt really bad for him for a second, but then I realized...

Yeah, me too.

Then I realized, well, first of all, I would feel sorry for you if you couldn't get the dates because of your horrible acne.

But now I feel kind of sorry for the girl in the story.

Like, here's a girl who's like, you know, John is a really sweet guy.

Yeah, he has horrible acne, but he's a good guitarist.

He's really nice.

I'm actually going to go out with this guy.

And he's like out there canceling dates saying no.

But didn't he know, I mean, did these women know that he had acne when they said yes?

That's what I'm saying, Todd.

See, I'm going to get on board with this premise here.

I'm not listening to you.

You're going to be a great co-host.

I think I'm doing a great job.

Who was it?

I haven't seen one person leave yet.

Who was it that said, uh, improvisers say yes and and comedians are like, I don't think so.

That's kind of your style as it goes, I have to say.

Yes, and I think that's a great expression.

That's more of what I want to see out of you here.

I don't have those rules, man.

Sometimes I yes and sometimes I no and.

How does one no and, by the way?

I don't know.

Let's try to do it.

Okay, I'll establish a premise as an improviser.

And you try to no and me.

Okay, here we go.

This is the first time.

Uh, it's almost sacrilege to do that here, isn't it?

To no and here?

Okay, here we go.

I'm, uh, hello, sir.

I know it's a Sunday, but our bread store is usually closed, but I saw you out there.

We're really wanting bread, so I, if I did you in.

This is why I don't do improv.

I realized very quickly that that was going nowhere.

Let me, maybe there's something better.

I didn't think it would be impossible to no and that.

Okay, there's something very simple.

Okay, so like, here we are.

Hi, Joe.

Thanks for coming over.

No, I'm not over.

And I am named Joe.

I'm not over.

Wow.

All right, the very first no and from Todd Berry.

All right, Todd, are you ready for our first guest?

I just reinvented the rules of improv.

This place is going to have to close down for a month.

I think they're going to have to dole clothes.

Everything they've taught me.

Anyway, way to step on my good joke with your fucking awful pun.

Fuck you.

I'm going to go get my laptop from my apartment.

I would like to host this show.

You don't have the proper notes.

Let's get to our first guest.

What do you say?

We have a packed show.

We have great guests.

And I have a benefit to do at eight o'clock.

Really?

What bit?

Tell us more about this benefit.

I'm so interesting the last time.

Just the usual I go up, tell some jokes, walk.

I say no, no payment for me.

They tried to give me the payment, even though it's a benefit.

I work at places that don't understand what a benefit is.

They have a check ready.

I know it's not supposed to be made out to me.

Make that out to Haiti, I guess.

You can slip me a 20 days for cab fare, but don't.

All right.

Enough.

Enough yimmer yammering.

Yeah, let's do it.

First guest.

Are they going to sit right there?

Somewhere.

This is kind of loosey gosy today.

I haven't really planned this out, but our first guest is an old friend.

Of mine, we worked together a good dozen years ago on a TV show.

Please welcome David Cross.

Now David is getting what we in the business call extra laughs.

Due to the outfit that you're wearing.

If you would describe exactly what.

Oh, all right.

What is happening here?

These boots.

Oh, dear.

The boots here.

Let me just say the boots are not exactly what we're talking about.

David seems to be wearing a knee length sweater.

It's a sweatshirt with a queen nephertiti.

Queen nephertiti.

And with a belt.

Or a cabaret, I do.

I can't tell which one it's supposed to be.

Or it could be scarface.

I can't tell from this because I'm looking down at it.

No, I was just in Sundance.

So.

No applause for Sundance?

Yeah, I went to, I got into some of the gifting suites.

It's all free.

Free swag.

I love that it's actually sort of a mock turtleneck as well.

That's the extra difference on that.

And you decided to disintegrate at the waist with a belt.

He made it his own.

I like that.

Yeah, it's called fashion Scott.

I have a strong sense of fashion.

I really, all I'm missing is some Virginia slims and one of those big floppy hats.

Cheryl Teague's.

Have you met John Mayer?

I see you eyeing that magazine.

Have you seen his stand-up comedy?

No, I haven't.

But wait a second, he's not the son of Bin Laden.

Is he really?

He really is, yeah.

A lot of people don't know that about Mays.

No, but he looks suckable in that.

Every part of him.

Yeah.

You know?

So what's going on?

What are you doing in New York?

I just came out for fun.

Vacation, you know?

Trying to get away with him while you're doing this.

I thought it would be, he's like Leno, man.

He doesn't take any days off.

I just live off, I live off the money.

I live off the money I make from this show.

Yeah, just having fun.

Thought I'd come out and do a show.

Thank you so much for coming by.

It's really nice of you.

What the hell, right?

At a moment's notice.

Yeah, I'm down the street.

I think I called you just like maybe three weeks ago.

Four forty-five?

Oh, yeah, three weeks ago.

Four forty-five, about three weeks ago.

How do you remember that time?

So, so clearly.

It was awful.

Because you called and I got in the wreck when I answered the phone.

And I wasn't going to.

It's on all the police reports.

Yeah, yeah, I wasn't going to answer it and pick it up.

But I was like, you know, Scott knows not to call me when I'm driving in my car.

Because you send out texts all your friends that you're driving when you start.

I have a different ringtone which appears to you, the caller.

Ring back, we call that.

Yeah, if I'm in my car and I know that you, I know you are, you're concerned about the environment, global warming.

So, of course, I'm just extrapolating that so you care about your friends.

I'm guessing.

It's kind of like strange connection to make, but it's sort of tenuous.

So, well, if you care so much about fucking, you know, not throwing away a goddamn plastic bottle, every once in a fucking two years and you start yelling at me and then posting the thing on YouTube about me throwing a plastic bottle, I assume you care about the environment.

If you care about the environment, I assume you be care about human beings.

If you care about human beings, you care about your friend who's driving a car in the middle of a school district.

Oh no.

With blind?

Oh no.

Yeah.

With blind.

Well, now angels. They're now blind angels.

Have a nice few more blind angels up there.

You know, God wants, God doesn't have enough blind angels.

Apparently, six.

He had six less blind angels than he wanted.

Now he's got him.

He called them two.

Not six yet. It's five, but it doesn't look good.

One's just hanging on.

Yeah.

Now David, the last time I saw you was Vancouver as well.

You, you know.

Vancouver, Canada.

Oh, that's how you have to say it.

Yeah.

We did a show together.

You were promoting your, we could still call it a new book.

Shut up, you fucking baby, right?

All my notes are wrong here.

Now what's the book called again?

I drink for a reason, right?

Yes.

And how's that doing?

It's doing well, but it's interesting because I learned the bar for doing well with books is much, much lower than you'd imagine.

Really?

I would think.

Yeah. I mean, it's what was shocking to me.

I mean, it's so low.

What I, what I pretty much know is like, you know, downloads and CD sales and, you know, movie stuff.

You're really into that.

I know.

We talk about that a lot.

That's the, but that's the, the, the reference point I had.

This is the first book I've ever had.

And, and my publisher called me and he's like, Hey, great news.

What?

Your book sold 20,000, your book sold 20,000 copies.

It's going to be on the New York Times bestseller list.

Well, 20,000 copies.

Now, to me, to me, this just, there's 300 million Americans.

Yeah.

20,000 is what is a success in the publishing business.

To me, it just sounds like you're bragging about selling 20,000 copies.

I'm not.

To be honest.

I'm not. I was hoping to sell.

If I may say.

I was hoping to sell, you know, I just went off of like record sales.

So I thought, Oh, it's going to be.

That was your way of showing you sold more than 20,000 records.

Yeah.

I think how many records have you sold there?

I think that's a given if you look at my own.

How much money do you make in any given year?

Can we ask?

Can we ask that?

In any given year?

Any year.

Just pick a year and tell me how much money you make.

You pick a year.

I'll tell you.

Okay.

1999.

$17 million.

Yes.

1998.

$4.

Really?

A lot happened.

You're talking about investments, right?

I'm counting investments.

Well, you invested in the Prince 1999 song.

Yes.

Right.

I thought he meant $19.99 when I first heard it.

I was like, that's a lot of money to charge in 1999.

And it wasn't even 1999 yet.

So I figured, yeah, this is going to be, I mean, and people love Prince.

So I'm going to be making a shit.

Well, I want to know.

But I was.

Yeah, I was.

But no, he had to do that.

Point charging.

999.

Yeah.

I look like an idiot.

Todd, what do you got?

Income-wise?

No, just you're the co-host.

Those answers, those questions you asked me, I will give non-joke answers.

Really?

You will.

Because a lot of people will not.

I've asked that question before.

I actually retired the question because of how much people make because it makes people too uncomfortable.

Which is how I like to start every interview in a very awkward place.

But if you will give us non-joke answers.

I just realized that I can't be funny with this because.

Because people are going to laugh anyway regardless of what you say.

No, because I don't think we need laughs.

Because every joke has already been made.

I don't think we need laughs.

I think people are.

I think people are actually really interested.

If I went in the middle and said like $600,000, it would be like.

Is that how much it is?

I'm a dot.

Wait.

How did you get it on the dot?

Do you like go out there and work a little harder?

Here's Eve gig.

And at that point I'd made $599,994.

And I was supposed to get like 20 grand for the last gig.

And I said, please pay me just six dollars.

Todd, see you made it funny.

I've never seen a promoter with that face.

You're asking for less money?

Yes, I'm asking for significantly less.

You're trying to chew them up.

In a sense.

I like that.

Now you guys are fast friends.

You're both New York comedians.

We met backstage and it's been really stopped.

Yeah.

And since, and between being backstage and starting the show, we went to the Hamptons for a weekend.

And we both enrolled in night school, learning annex.

Todd is going to learn how to make Tex-Mex, and I'm going to learn how to do pottery.

I think we're talking about moving in together.

And we're going to go in a case, in on a case of blush wine.

That's, let's, let's, I mean let's save some of this for ourselves.

You know, some of the, let's not air all our dirty clothes.

It's like a barber Walters integral.

We're going to be crying.

I almost had Todd Glass crying last week.

He was talking about his dead dog.

I'm so close.

So close to my first crying interview.

Did his dog die?

Yeah.

And he actually told me he would give me a hundred bucks if I made him cry.

And I was so close.

Did he tell you the bet we made when we run tour?

You know his bit.

He just, he just opened for you on your shut up you fucking baby tour.

Right.

Sort of.

Yeah.

No, it's called Bigger and Blacker.

And it's, he's bigger.

You're blacker.

And, but you know his bit, his great bit about the, the, um, chambwile thing about, they tell you what it, it'll pick up this and you know it'll do this and he, and his whole thing is like don't tell me what it does.

Tell me how it works or whatever.

And then he would go it picks up juice and soda and dah, dah, dah.

I know, I know what a fucking rag does.

I bet him, I mean, no, that's him.

That's what he said.

You know, and I bet him, I said I'll give you a thousand dollars if you do that for two minutes.

You just do a list of things you can pick up for two minutes and I'll give you a thousand dollars.

And he.

Who timed it?

Oh, we've made, there was a tour manager and there was another guy on this.

Was he giving like signals?

Did the crowd know what was happening?

No, the crowd did not know any time.

And he only, he finally got it on literally the last show.

Really?

And we would stand there with a stopwatch.

He tried before then, but he was not successful.

Yeah.

Because he ran out of things or because he ran out of nerve.

I think he ran out of nerve.

I think that's what it was.

And, cause it was also the kind of joke where you know it's, you laugh and then you stop laughing and then you laugh really hard and then you stop like is he going to do this forever?

And then you laugh again at the absurdity.

Then you're like, alright I get it, I get it.

And then you stop laughing and then you laugh again really quick.

This is nuts.

And then.

And that's all in the first minute.

And then the second minute is just dead silence.

The second minute is a review of the first minute.

Nobody finally did it though, Leschow.

Wow.

Yeah.

Sometimes you would get to like a minute 48.

Damn it.

It was pretty fun.

Oh.

$1,000.

No, you got even made $1,000.

So how'd that go for you?

Did you write them a check or?

Traveler's checks, you're out there on the road.

Um, I.

Yeah.

Man, does anybody, does anybody have those anymore?

Do they exist anymore?

I don't know.

Remember?

Ty is in whenever I go above 14th Street.

New York reference.

Remember Carl Malden would have the.

I don't know what you're talking about.

He's an actor from the old days.

Oh.

And he goes.

Never really told what happened.

Of course I know.

Carl Malden.

I'll say that for humor.

Yeah.

No, that is a lot of my style.

Dead pen awkward.

Uh, but yes, I do remember the commercials that he did.

I remember the commercials and you were in the middle of your impersonation of them, which you used to do.

I do an evening with Carl Malden.

And that was with him actually on stage watching your impression.

Yeah, it was just for him.

He paid me a lot of money.

He was a very wealthy eccentric man and I nobody else was allowed in the theater and he would, uh, the weird thing is he'd sit all the way up top in the balcony so I couldn't see him.

Was he on the street and then he would send, he would send an assistant to tell me what he was thinking how he thought of it as I was doing it.

Really?

So you would get notes during the actual performance?

Yeah, there wouldn't be like physical notes, but it would be, uh, they would play, he'd record himself saying, well, I didn't think that was very accurate and then they'd come up and play it.

Wow.

And you were expected to change your performance based upon those notes.

Uh, once a year.

Yeah.

And my choosing.

How many shows a week would you do?

Uh, 19.

19 really.

Yeah.

Seems like quite a lot.

I mean, did you take one day off Mondays, traditionally dark?

Um, yeah.

So three shows a day of the, some days you would do four?

I'm done with this riff.

I'm trying to.

I really am.

That's enough.

Enough's enough.

Honest to God.

Look at these poor people.

They came here.

When you say that you mean they're.

You mean they're, you know, look what happens.

You mean they're actually poor people when you say that.

Yeah, they're in New York.

Cause you judge people.

Let's get some audience salaries.

Yeah, it's very, yeah.

Let's find out.

Audience salaries.

Let's point to people and ask them how many of them I.

David, what's going on with what is happening with the chipmunks?

Is there a third?

Oh, oh.

I hope so.

No, and I, and I do not say that judging you.

You know that I.

I don't even care anymore.

Yeah.

So I'm so at peace with.

Yeah, you should be.

Uh, no, I, I, I'm, I made so much crazy money.

Yeah.

From that stupid movie.

Not stupid.

It's for kids.

Here's the thing.

Let's, let's be honest.

Let's do this.

There's no accounting for the taste of five year olds.

They are idiots.

They have the worst taste.

I, when I was five, I watched the bicycle thief.

I would go and see a passolini retrospective.

Sure.

Like most people of culture.

Yes.

So, cultured, real cultured children.

Jews.

You know.

But, Ashkenazek Jews.

Not Sephardic.

Um, they're, you know, they, they're, they're, you know, these, these kids today where they're, being entertained by animation.

Ugh.

And high pitched.

Everything's just kidding.

They're just in more ons.

These children are easily entertained buffoons.

There.

I said buffoon.

I was hoping I'd never, ever say that word in my life.

But yes, they're idiots.

And look, if, you know, if there's a five year old who's that retarded that he's going to like, he's going to be entertained for two hours by a singing animated chipmunk.

Hey, what the, well, I'll take his money.

I'm good with God damn.

How many, have you ever thought about how many children have to buy a ticket in order to pay for your salary?

Um, well, hopefully, I mean, if they're, well, disciplined, then yeah, they are paying their own money.

Um, as you would with the concertos and, and, and also, you know, keep in mind that, uh, I think, whatever the price of a children's ticket is these days, you know, 12 bucks, whatever.

Um, seems a lot for me.

I don't know.

Yeah.

I don't have kids.

We never have kids.

I'll have a teenager who's cultured, but I'm not going to have a child who laughs at cartoons.

Are you, are you into the adoption process at all?

Oh, God, no, not for me, not for anyone.

I think there should be, I think there should be an island.

And on that island, we have simply, uh, children.

Oh, and, um, and then, uh, shitty toys.

That was the wrong time for me to ask for your autograph.

I apologize.

I'm not going to ask for your autograph.

Uh, David, tell us a little bit about your background.

You grew up in hot Atlanta.

Yeah.

Um, yeah, I, uh, I grew up in Atlanta, yes.

That's all I wanted to do.

Hot Atlanta.

Thank you.

You know, here's the thing that people don't know about Atlanta is because it's so highly elevated in the mountainous region that in the, uh, fall and winter and early spring, it can get very cold.

And people think, oh, yeah, it's hot.

It's hot in those three months in the summer.

It's awful.

But then it, you know, it gets down.

It gets down there, like 38, 37, six degrees.

People don't think about that.

They go, oh, Atlanta, it's hot.

It's hot Atlanta.

So there's a little something for you.

If you're going, if you're going in, uh, you know, November, December, January, February, March, definitely take a sweater and a coat.

And that is a tip from me to you.

Chip at the top.

Hello, go.

Thank you.

Uh, David, I know you have to leave your, where, where are you getting to?

Where are you off to?

What's happening?

I am going to London, England.

Yes, that's right.

Tomorrow.

To do your show.

We should, we should talk about your show.

Well, I'm officially not allowed to.

Sorry.

But yeah, I'll be there till August starting in about 12 hours.

Wow.

I leave in about 12 hours.

That's great.

Well, I really appreciate you coming by before you had to leave.

It means a lot to me.

And it's great to see you before you're gone until August.

Yeah, yeah.

I always enjoy making people laugh, you know.

If I can get serious for one second, I...

Please, please.

Let's really, let's really Jerry Lewis this up here for a second.

Like, can we cue the music?

I'm trying to, as you know, there was a recent tragedy and I'm trying to raise money for the victims of the tsunami.

And, uh...

Seems a little late for that.

Well, you know what they say.

Better...

Death and Red?

No, no, no.

I was thinking, uh, big, big, big.

Wow.

And, uh...

Okay, um, yeah, so I'll be there until, uh, until August.

Great.

Well, uh, let everyone applaud you and you can hear that applause and it will tell you how much they appreciate you coming by.

David Cross, everyone.

Thank you, everybody.

APPLAUSE All right.

APPLAUSE What do you think about that?

That was a good... I think this is a good show.

You get... people are going to be talking about how good this show...

Oh, really?

You think so?

Is anyone live tweeting this show?

Oh, boy, that would be a dream, wouldn't it?

Uh, all right, well, we have another guest.

Whoa, I guess there's no one.

Oh, no, just people dropping by.

Yes, I had my little fucking moment in the sun, huh?

That's good.

You are free to interject at any point.

As far as I know, you've been killing with this crowd.

I've practically...

Everything you say, they're eating it out of hand.

But the media and you kill like I do are insatiable.

That is true.

We need to just keep killing us now.

That is the bitter irony.

There's no quitting while you're ahead.

It's just...

Kill, kill, kill.

All right, so, uh...

Here we go.

Here's our next guest.

He's another friend of mine.

He was gracious enough to drop by.

Straight from a movie set.

He's on.

Please welcome Zach Elifenek.

Yes.

A lot of big guns on the show tonight.

Big guns on the show tonight.

Big guns.

How are you, buddy?

Well, thank you very much.

Scott, hi, Todd.

Hey.

Is this still Todd?

You think at a certain level he'll just change his name because he gets so fast?

I tried every eight years.

I try a lot of different stage names.

Remember when you love me that message?

You're like, it's Brett now.

You just...

You just hung up?

How are you?

Hey, drink it a beer.

It's good sex.

Winding down for the weekend?

That's right.

Yeah.

Now, what have you been filming?

You just, I mentioned you came from set.

Are you allowed to talk about it?

That's what you do now, Zach.

You're out there filming movies.

You're a big movie star.

As far as I know, you had two number one movies last year.

What do you want me to fucking say about that?

I forgot my original question.

What set are you on?

What kind of movie takes place in a mental institution?

That is perfect for your comedy.

Can I just say...

Can I be in that movie?

Look, look, I'm crazy.

I'm just saying you can put in a word.

That's how...

Our last stage is on Monday.

Do you get a lot of that, Zach?

Do you get a lot of people asking you to be in the movies now?

I know you must be getting it from Brody Stevens, but are you getting a lot of stuff?

Are you getting a lot of it from people you don't know very well?

Yeah, people constantly coming up to me like, will you put me in a movie?

My family asked me a lot and I got to put my dad in a movie in the fall, or a lot of people call it Autumn.

And he was in the movie, but yeah, you have people ask you, and it's a little offensive.

I mean, you don't go up to a surgeon and go...

Not at the same thing, but...

They're very, very different.

I like to try that surgeon thing out.

I do that. I didn't know that was not cool, though.

Shut up. Shut up, Brett.

So, buddy, you're in New York. It's great to see you.

You are making movies. You're out there doing TV stuff.

Are you on the board-to-death show, still?

Board-to-death on HB.

Oh, yeah.

Board-to-death on H?

That's people who work on it can call it H, right?

Yeah, we don't have time for the other part.

We're so busy.

But yeah, TV shows and stuff. It was a TV show.

Yeah, stuff.

Todd, basically, I don't have a lot to ask you because we didn't do a pre-interview or anything, but is there anything you'd like to talk about?

Like, what's on your mind, the state of the union, what gets under Zach's skin?

You know, can we talk about that a little bit?

Like, the day-to-day things that just bother Zach Alifanak is that he... bother him so much he just needs to get off his chest.

He doesn't have time to answer that now.

Because your question was...

Uhh...

I don't like Chinatown.

Tell us about Chinatown. What?

It just gets on my fucking nerves.

Why is it?

No, I'm just kidding. I don't have nothing to get sh- Why would I hate Chinatown?

It's not the people. It's not the people.

What gets on my nerves? I don't...

Are you serious?

I don't know.

Do you just try to eat up time?

I just figure out what to talk about because...

Yeah, because we're friends and I don't want to do just an interview interview, so, you know, because that's boring, right?

Yeah.

One of the things that gets on my nerves the most is my friends being unprepared.

How am I supposed to prepare for...

Okay.

No. What really gets on my nerves?

I mean, I'll talk about what you're talking about.

What do you like out there? You're a big music fan?

What the fuck do you want to talk about?

Uhh...

Tell you what, tell you what, tell you what.

Let's turn this around. Okay.

You asked the questions.

Sure. Okay.

You're a skilled...

You're a skilled interviewer.

Okay.

So you asked the questions.

Umm...

I'm a 10 times 6.

As far as I know, 54.

Nope, they changed it.

Every year's they changed that.

It changed, that's right.

Umm...

But what gets on my nerves?

I don't like people that litter.

Really? Is that really a peppy move?

Yeah, I will tell people don't litter if I say them litter.

Really?

And now that you're famous, do people say...

Hey, man, I like that.

They still say, shut up, pussy.

I only need to go up to pick it.

Oh, this is a little bit on the subject.

I don't know this, uh, speaking.

I...

Oh, well, not too long ago, I was walking on, um, I was crossing Ludlow Street.

I was walking towards the Williamsburg Bridge to walk home.

I had probably, uh...

Anyway, I had a couple of drinks.

Always supposed to believe that you walk over the bridge to go home.

Not everybody has a Vespa Todd.

Fucker's good, he's going to tell it.

No, I'm gonna do it.

This fucker's good.

Um, so this is another thing against my nerves in the city, is that when people cut you off when you're walking, because it's a very, uh, anti-pandestrian city, and I don't mind it, like if a cab does it, but I saw this, uh, Jag, like a fancy Jag.

The star of Jag.

Don't...

Uh, this Jag-war, Jag-war, Jag-wire car.

I actually thought when you first said that you were saying a Jag-off, like, that's some expression that you start using.

No, no, no, no, the automobile.

And, uh, it was like a brand new, and it cut me off, and I hit it really hard with my hand.

Whoa.

And, uh, that was it, and I walked.

Luckily, I could buy it if he got really mad.

What's that?

You could buy it off if he got really mad.

Yeah, that's...

I thought that's...

I should've said that.

Um, really surprised that didn't get a big laugh.

Deserved mark, I have to be honest.

So anyway, um, these, uh, I had my headphones on, so I didn't... I just walked.

I didn't think anything of it, smacking this car as hard as it could.

And all of a sudden, I get a tap on my shoulder, and, uh, it was two giant six-foot-five guys, and I can't remember what they said, but they spit my face.

And, uh, I remember thinking I didn't know what to...

I didn't really know.

I was so embarrassed by getting spit on.

I didn't know what I said back.

But all I remember is running.

I got back in the car running towards the trash can and picking up a beer bottle in the trash can and saying to myself, out loud, nobody spits in that golf and acuses.

LAUGHTER APPLAUSE And this was before the hangover.

Oh, dear.

So anyway, that's another thing that gets on my nerves.

Anyway, I threw the bottle.

Did it hit?

No, it didn't hit.

I don't know.

Yeah, I am lucky.

That was really stupid to do.

It goes against my littering policy.

Yeah.

I hope you went back and picked up the bottle afterward.

At least you didn't take a taxi home.

That would have been worse.

Why are you walking around at night?

You guys not like me anymore?

What's going on?

What is fucking funny?

I would have highlighted this fucking show, like, ten minutes ago.

Why are you walking around at night, like, where, when giant, I'm assuming black people came...

LAUGHTER I just...

You didn't see that hesitation when he was describing them.

I was like, I'm not a man.

I'm a six-foot-five people.

LAUGHTER This all white audience noticed that as well.

LAUGHTER They were both wearing soul-trained t-shirts.

LAUGHTER That's what that was on, because it was 20, 20 below.

LAUGHTER Yeah, I walk around a line.

I walk around listening to music.

I just...

What's new?

Your tunes?

By tunes?

The Bible.

Todberry sets.

LAUGHTER That's why we email them to you.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER So now, Zach, this is a podcast, so people may be listening to it.

LAUGHTER What?

He gets up and leaves now, so I don't know.

We're fucking podcast.

People may be listening to this in the future, but it's almost...

Oscar nominations are about to be announced, I believe, Sunday or something.

Are you predicting the hangover will be nominated and are you predicting that it will win?

LAUGHTER It will win. It won't be nominated.

LAUGHTER And I don't know how that works.

It won't be nominated.

And if it is nominated, then something is really fucked up.

But you guys won the Golden Globe, admittedly in the musical and comedy.

I know, I can't believe we beat it. It's complicated.

LAUGHTER It was so complicated, too, wasn't it? Did you see the movie?

I haven't seen it, no.

Just everything about it was so complicated.

There was a woman who wanted a big kitchen, but she already had a big kitchen.

Buddy, I haven't seen it yet. I haven't seen it.

Sorry. Spilers.

Spilers.

LAUGHTER Do you think you're going to go out for the Oscars?

No.

No. They want us to perform, do a number, but...

You say perform, really.

LAUGHTER Excuse me, they want us to perform.

LAUGHTER What did I say wrong?

He said perform.

How do you say it?

Perform.

What?

Like a gentleman.

They want us to perform.

I miss...

No, I don't know.

Oh, really? I miss pronounce words.

Perform.

They want us to...

Well, you're just fucking jealous because they didn't ask you to perform.

Oh, I am so jealous.

Anyway, they didn't ask you to do a...

Sang?

Or song?

LAUGHTER But I don't know. I would rather not do it.

Not because it's not my scene.

Because you're not into this whole stardom trip.

LAUGHTER Right?

No, but you avoid the spotlight, the roar of the grease paint.

LAUGHTER Give me something.

Your real people is what he's trying to say.

No, I'm not at all.

I'm not real people at all.

I'm just telling you what he was trying to say.

You're like Fran Tarkingdon and...

You're real people.

I'm like an old, supportive people.

LAUGHTER I got it out.

OK.

What was this about? Did I miss this?

We were talking about John Mayer.

Have you seen John Mayer do stand-up comedy?

Nope.

I'm trying to incite everyone.

We'll say just nope.

No, is it bad?

Oh, I don't know. I've never seen it yet.

I got to tell you, and maybe this will go against the grain of the attitude towards him this evening.

I love it. You're always alternative.

LAUGHTER That's a terrible thing that he does with no shirt on.

But I've done something with him and he was quite funny.

What did you do with him?

I did a thing with a sketch.

Some people call him spoofs.

LAUGHTER And I thought, but this was like nine years ago.

Oh, 9-11.

LAUGHTER That's right.

We escaped Tower Two together.

LAUGHTER Why is that?

Two?

I don't know why that got to...

Yeah, why would that get to grow?

Yeah, you set it up.

LAUGHTER I got nothing. I'm just sorry. I didn't mean to...

Got nothing to add to the 9-11 talks?

No, I was just thinking about it.

Were you in New York City when that happened?

Oh, Jesus.

LAUGHTER Yeah, I was, and we're not going to talk about it.

You don't want to talk about your very personal experience?

Nope.

LAUGHTER Zach, can you stay for the rest of the show?

Can you stay out here?

Yeah.

It's great.

Yeah, okay.

What else is the show, though?

What else?

We have other guests.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

So then you can chime in and you can, you know...

Oh, yeah.

It's a lot like the last one you did.

Okay, very well.

Yeah, and we can have more of these delivered to you if you want.

We can even have them delivered to me.

Would that be weird?

Yeah.

Would that be something crazy?

Would you like a yingling?

Yingling?

Am I saying it right?

What are you asking me?

No, would you like...

This is what it is.

Oh, is that a beer?

Oh.

Uh, sure.

Yeah, did you bring these?

No, I fucking bought it like a gentleman.

I fucking bring beer into places.

You've never brought beer anywhere.

No, I just had beer.

Because I'm staring at your beard.

How can you make those kind of jokes?

Those are terrible.

I'm hoping a beer, a beard in breakfast.

No, I bought it over there.

Okay.

Did I tell you about my pilot just did not get picked up?

Oh, he did.

Oh, I didn't read the...

I didn't read the...

Oh, yeah.

It's about...

You know, there's an audience here, right?

It's about...

AHHH!

This is still a show, I think.

It's about unintelligent physicians who don't read at all.

It's called Doctors Without Borders.

Oh, my God.

Have you heard about that at all?

Uh, sadly, I've thought of that joke before.

Let's commiserate.

I'm not even joking.

Your red face makes me believe you.

All right, well, we're going to bring out our next guest.

No, we're not ready to do that.

We are ready.

First of all, Zach Alfanakis, give him a round of applause.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE How are we doing?

Oh, good.

Okay.

Our next guest is a gentleman...

I don't know, a gentleman is a wrong term for it.

I think you'll see why when he gets out here.

Someone I met on the street at a Rite Aid that I thought would be, I don't know, kind of an interesting change of pace.

One of those outdoor Rite Aids.

He's back!

He's back, I gotta say, the last 15 minutes you have been deadly.

I know.

But you're finally back, so thank you very much.

Please welcome to the stage Winnie the Whiny Baby is here.

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hi, hi.

Do you want me to move over?

No, no, no, you can go over here.

We have plenty of mics.

No, stay here.

Do you mean you want to move over to get away from him?

No, I thought it was just being courteous to the baby, that's all.

Uh, for the...

Cher, should I sit in?

Probably that one.

That's a good call.

Hi, Winnie.

Hi.

Winnie is...

Winnie is a...

Just to set the scene for the home listener.

Winnie is a giant baby.

He's dressed in a diaper with a bib.

What does your bib say, by the way?

It says I love my mommy.

Aw.

He also seems to have a ring of pacifiers.

Yeah.

Which I believe was Johnny Cash's follow-up.

Oh, he cracked a smile.

That's a good one.

That was a good joke.

It always feels good to make a baby smile.

Now, Winnie, I met you on the street and I just thought you were a fascinating person.

But to be honest, you seem...

You know, when I first met you, you were full of life, just full of Jwadowiv.

Ruh.

If I may...

Yeah, he just...

Parted my own French.

But you seem a little despondent today.

You seem a little sad.

Yeah, I feel sad.

Things haven't been going so well for me.

You want me to talk about it?

You know what?

It is your choice.

You can keep it to yourself, or you can error your grievances out here.

I'll talk about it if you want.

Well, a bunch of stuff.

First off, I moved into a new place, a new apartment.

Should I talk looking at you or looking out that way?

You know what?

If you're more accustomed to telling the nice people this story, then please do it.

I'll swing back and forth.

I don't like the sound of that coming from you.

I moved into a new place and I had to get the cable all set up and the cable guy, the company, said that the cable guy was going to come between 10 and 2.

And so I woke up at 9.45 in the morning, you know, because he came right at 10.

But then he...

He didn't end up coming until 2.30 in the afternoon.

And I just... when he showed up, he didn't have the modem he was supposed to have.

And so now he has to come back.

I have to wait all over again.

And I called up the company to complain.

And they said that they would give me a month of free DVR, which is only an $11 value.

And I just feel really sad and raw about it.

And I'm feeling sensitive.

And I just need somebody to give me a hug and pet me.

And I just want...

I'm standing up just going on to the crowd.

I just need somebody to...

What do you say you need a hug from these people?

Hug me and soothe me a little bit.

And I just want to pet...

Can you pet me as opposed to patting me?

Thank you.

What?

Oh my God, how many comedians are in this room?

Can you pet all the way down my bat, please?

The fine gentleman is doing great job petting...

Petting with me.

Thank you.

Well, do you feel better about that then?

I feel a little bit better, but I have more complaints to talk about if you want.

Sorry.

Might I say your first complaint did not seem like the common complaint of an infant?

Oh, you've spoken to a lot of infants?

That's a good point.

You think most infants are fine with waiting around for four hours?

Not...

Where are your parents in this scenario?

Normally they would be the ones to wait.

What do they do?

Well, my mother is dead.

Oh, I'm sorry.

When did that happen?

She died in childbirth.

Really?

For a viewer or a brother or a sister?

Me.

What ifs?

Well, I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to bring up such a horrible topic.

I just, you know, I won wonders.

Who's parenting the parents?

Are you asking about my grandparents?

Are they the ones who take care of you?

Thanks, Todd.

No.

They're dead too.

Really? How do they die?

In Haiti.

Now, first of all, when he...

I just want to be clear because you have kind of a high-pitched baby voice.

Did you say the 80s or Haiti?

You said Haiti.

Haiti.

Now, was this during the earthquake?

No, it was in the 80s.

Interesting.

So this is a fascinating family history.

Your grandparents gave birth to your mother.

Is this your maternal grandparents?

Yeah.

Okay.

Gave birth to your mother in the 80s, I would imagine.

Or the 70s?

How old was your mother?

When she died?

Sure.

She was 43.

Okay.

So now what?

You're an infant.

So...

I'm a newly born infant.

So I'm guessing that we're talking somewhere in the...

Somewhere in the 70s?

No.

In 1967?

Was she born?

Not to get into the...

Well, 43 years from now...

So 1967, she was born.

Yeah.

So she...

That's a very late birth, by the way.

A lot of women don't like to do that to get birth into their 40s.

It's very dangerous.

No wonder...

I mean, you know, I'm not one to judge.

But...

No wonder what?

What?

He can talk and has a great vocabulary?

The typical problems of late pregnancies aren't that the mother dies.

Why did your mother die, by the way?

I was too big.

You are a very giant baby, I have to say.

So now what are some of your other complaints?

You mentioned you have...

You have otherwise.

Other complaints.

Sure.

Because it seems like you have a long laundry list.

Last time I saw you again, to reiterate, you were very happy.

Right.

As far as I can tell, I'm the only one on this show who actually has prepared material.

Just fine.

You should have prepared the math in your little fucking when your mom died.

It's numbers did not...

Numbers did not add up for me, man.

I can't believe I left shot at a real baby.

I feel awful right now.

I apologize.

Thank you, Todd.

And that cable thing is a bummer.

That never ends, though, unfortunately.

Cable?

No, that waiting.

You're going to have a whole life of that ahead of you.

As long as you know, moving around.

If you're lucky, you'll stay in the same place, you know, for years and years.

But, you know, even cable systems change.

You'll update to HD.

You know, I've got HD.

And there's other like deliveries like that.

But they'll invent something down the road better than HD, and you'll end up waiting.

HD isn't really, you know, it's not a specific format.

There's lots of different types of broadcast...

Is this what you came to talk about?

By the way, or did you come to talk about your second complaint?

One, I'll talk about it.

By all means, let's slow down this bit.

My second complaint is I had a doctor's appointment, and it was all the way uptown in Manhattan.

And now I'm in Brooklyn, mind you.

So for me, this is like an hour on the train.

And when I got there, the whole doctor's office was closed.

And I don't understand why they would give me an appointment on a day when it was closed.

And I remember exactly the fat Puerto Rican woman who gave me the appointment.

And I'm like, these are the people who have a national pride day.

I don't know what they're so proud of.

Can't give me the right doctor's appointment time.

Are you sure that you didn't just write down the wrong day?

Yeah, I mean, that happens a lot.

Oh, she wrote, she gave me a printout.

Oh!

That's what they do. You don't write it down.

They write it down for you.

I've never been to your particular doctor's office.

I'm so sorry.

When you go to the doctor, they tell it to you, and then they hand you a pen and a piece of paper, and you write it down for yourself.

Well, to be honest, I don't have the litany...

I have to side with the baby on this one.

I don't have the litany fat.

I would say for what I'm paying, you're going to write down on my next appointment.

I don't have a litany of medical problems.

I have slightly high liver results.

And to be fair, you're a giant baby.

I mean, that doesn't just happen.

I mean, you're freakishly large.

Right.

Has your doctor ever told you exactly why that happened?

I mean, you came out of your mother's for China.

No, I had to be cut out of her.

Alrighty.

And it killed the poor woman.

She was a bloody mess.

She was already dead because on account of my feet were pushing me into her heart.

You know, I've heard of Kickstart my heart, but not quite like that.

That's funny, though.

Kickstart my heart.

Thank you.

The baby is really giving it up to me.

I really appreciate it.

Okay, so you feel bad about the doctor thing.

That is a bummer.

Were you delivered by the same doctor who was closed for the appointment?

It seems like I wouldn't be able to go back to that doctor knowing he had killed my mother.

You must have changed doctors.

Did you notice the audience missed a laugh right there?

Well, I don't blame the doctor.

It's not the doctor's fault.

A lot of people would.

Well, I don't see why.

I was just stepping on my mother's heart and mushing it in my toes.

Just squeezing my mouth.

Honestly, that did feel good, right?

Regardless of what the end result was.

It's like a nice, it's like a kushball or something.

It's like a stress reliever.

You're saying that my mother's heart is like a kushball?

Yes, I am.

If he's not saying it, I am.

Yes.

So now, do you have a third complaint?

What, uh...

Yes.

Okay.

I know these things usually work in threes.

I have a complaint now, I'll upset.

Okay.

Usually, after my second complaint, I need to get another round of hugs and pets, though.

Well, when...

We can go backwards, sir.

When you write a one-man show about this, you can do that.

You don't want me to get more hugs and pets?

Only if I can pick the person you hug.

Oh, I'd love to see that, Todd.

Who would you pick?

Who clearly doesn't want this to help you?

Oh, this guy right here is, like, looking down, he's covering his face.

Which guy?

He's touching his face, which is a sign.

No, no, the guy right in the front row with a black shirt.

He was touching his face a minute, now he looks kind of like he wants his nose.

There's another guy...

I don't know.

Now he's into it, I don't know.

Okay.

Go ahead, Winnie.

Oh, my God.

Are you talking about...

Are you talking about this guy or that guy?

You know what?

Hug him both.

Okay, make your laps flat for me.

They were just breathing on my back so heavily.

Can you hug me, please?

You saw it before, you know how it works.

You stupid shit.

Pet me.

So he's getting a double hug here.

These guys really stepped up, I gotta say.

They dove right into it, man.

Giggly guys.

Breathily giggling in my ear while they pet me.

He should rub your wool cap against his back.

Oh, that would probably feel good.

Is it wool?

Does it have a tag in it?

Look at the tag and see what my channel is.

Did you buy it on St. Mark's place?

Can you stop giggling for a second and read it?

Now, feel free, Winnie, to point the mic at his mouth when he gives you this answer.

100% acrylic.

Yeah, okay.

Yeah.

It's not acrylic wool, I don't think.

Can you read it?

I don't think the next word is gonna be wool.

35% polyester.

Can I read it for you?

100% acrylic.

65% olefin.

35% polyester.

I think olefin and polyester are probably both classified under the acrylic umbrella.

Todd.

I am a textiles major, so.

I would head around the crowd.

Thank you.

Winnie, is that you've been satiated with your hug or pats or whatever the fuck you're doing?

For the brief moment.

But as we all know, you have a third complaint and you want...

Let's hear it.

I am genuinely interested.

You want to hear my third complaint?

We have one person saying yes.

It's only 149 who could go either way.

My third complaint is, you know how there's certain orange juice containers that say some pulp on them?

Are you familiar with this?

Yes, we are familiar with this.

I live in Florida.

The court stipulates that we are familiar with this.

Thank you.

Well, I think some women should be required to have that saying over their vaginas.

On account of... no, because on account of sometimes you're eating out a woman's pussy.

And they will have just gone to the bathroom and they'll still have some little pieces of peeled up toilet paper in there.

And then all you wanted to do was just lick the pussy.

But you have to end up pulling out little pieces of toilet paper with your teeth and your tongue.

And then you have to make...

And so I think that will be a fair warning.

And that complaint also requires a hug and a pet.

But it doesn't have to be right now.

I just want to say...

I didn't quite get but that one I'm with.

Have you guys experienced it?

That one crossed party lines.

Go ahead, get your hug from someone in the crowd.

Who do you pick for your third one normally?

Someone in the back, someone... what are you doing?

Well...

How do you do it?

How do you ask her to get into your process?

I usually just, like Todd said, the whatever person looks like they most don't want to.

Which right now sort of looks like this guy.

The guy does have his arms crossed, his body language.

But then you know what? Oh, he reached out.

Oh, he thought he would just get away with his...

He's hoping to circumvent the whole thing by doing an impromptu hug pet.

Can you embrace me fully please?

Oh.

Come on.

All the way around.

Don't touch that, I put that in my mouth.

Pat me now please.

Pat me.

All the way down.

Pat me.

There you go.

Thank you.

How do you feel, winning?

Do you feel better?

I feel better.

I've noticed that your voice is still quite whiny though, although I must have...

Yeah, maybe he's got a fourth one we can get out as well.

No, I feel better.

It's gonna take me a while.

I just have been feeling really raw and sensitive, so...

You'll get over it. Bye.

Where's your father in all this? I assume he's the only one alive or has he passed on as well.

Who's teaching you how to eat pussy?

What I'm trying to get at?

Who taught you how to eat pussy?

That's true. It just kind of comes natural, doesn't it?

Right back at you, man.

Wait, are you actually asking because you need some tips?

Yeah, nobody, you just get there and you figure it out, but for everybody it's different.

Some women like the up and down rhythm, and other women like a side to side or a circular...

I was told once to do the alphabet to kind of...

Sam, Kimison told you to do that, right?

I guess it was my friend.

Okay, I'm not really a commsuer.

Anyway, my apologies to Sam to the late Sam Kimison.

Did he die with your mother and he...

Or with your grandparents in the 80s? In the 80s?

Yeah. Really.

He was driving his car in Haiti, and he got in an accident, and he died.

He actually... The car that he hit was my grandparents car.

Really? This is the untold story of Sam Kimison's death.

Yeah.

Wow, you must have a lot of just raw emotions about that.

I would think that you would be more sensitive about your parents dying and your grandparents dying, and you being all alone other than these, to be honest, just kind of commonplace irritations that seem to have brought you down into such a funk.

Are you talking to me?

Wait.

Are you just doing your Robert De Niro impression?

Yeah, I mean, it's been hard for me, but you know, I try to take every day as it comes.

Hey, one day at a time.

Wait, we're...

Exactly, one time.

It's all my AA friends, say.

Yeah.

Have you ever tried AA maybe getting into that, or the victims of, you know, I don't know why I'm extending this bit.

Yeah, I was...

Fuck's sake.

Thank you for that.

You clearly want it to be over.

You're looking at me like, what the fuck are you doing?

No.

I don't know.

It hasn't had quite that endpoint that we like.

I can think back to maybe ten endpoints.

That's the one.

All right.

Come on.

Winning the way, baby.

Thank you.

Our final guest is a great musician who has a new album coming out.

In April, I believe you told me, and he's a great guy, and thankfully agreed to do this.

Please welcome Ted Leo, everyone.

Ted, thank you so much for coming by.

Thanks for having me.

Thanks.

We got a little more to talk about.

Now, you're going to play a song from your new record.

Which comes out in March, actually.

March, and what is it called?

It's called The Brutalist Bricks.

The Brutalist Bricks.

With an eye.

Brutalist with an eye.

Now, is that a long player?

It is.

It's on the shorter side for my own long player.

Is it like the punk style 30 minutes and out?

I try to give it the one side of a 90 minute cassette.

Oh, I like it.

So, 45.

A little bit less.

Yeah.

Okay.

Sure.

We'll get to it.

How long is it?

I don't know.

43 and a half.

Okay.

I have time the whole thing.

I'm going to tell us the title of this song before you sing it or just when you get it.

Yeah.

This is a song that on the record, I sing it really low, which I never really do.

We weren't able to play it live for a long time until I figured out that I just sing it.

Do it not.

I can buy.

I only played it alone once before and I actually had to watch myself on YouTube doing it earlier so that I could remember how to play it.

But I'm going to go for it.

That's okay.

I love it.

This is a brand new song.

It's called One Polaroid today.

♪ One Polaroid today.

Perfect episode.

Go away.

I go in a little delay.

It's a hero I love.

It's a document again.

Yes.

Ted Leo.

You should have watched the solo a little harder.

It was closer.

Did that not come out exactly the way you wanted to?

Ted, do you want to come sit down?

Can you?

Winnie, do you mind moving over?

Next to Todd.

Next to Todd, yes.

♪ Ted, just grab that mic if you could.

You kept the same mic, right?

Yeah.

How are you?

Thank you so much for coming by.

That was a beautiful.

Thanks.

That's off the due record.

Yeah.

Kind of my most John Mayer song, actually.

Really?

You mean about his comedy, though?

Absolutely.

What does that song about?

Can you talk about it or do you not like to talk about what songs are about?

Do you really want me to talk about it?

Yes, I do.

Okay.

I don't know.

It's just about like, it's about, well, I do know.

Actually, I don't know why I said I don't know, but it's about the kind of the culture of immediate gratification and also the need to document an archive every day.

Instead of just actually being able to kind of just like, you know, participate in something.

Now, do you find it ironic that you had to watch it on YouTube in order?

I didn't, but I do now.

Yeah.

I just, live tweeted that answer, otherwise that.

I didn't hear the question.

Did you do this record with the pharmacists?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, great.

And that's been your band for the past, how many years?

A long time.

I've been playing with our drummer Chris for like 10 years now, actually.

And you know, other people have come and gone, but the band as it is now has been as it is for a few years as well.

That's great.

And you're doing a few shows coming up, right?

In March, yeah.

Do a new tour like a national tour?

Yeah.

Where are you going to be?

We can plug this.

We're going to- How do people find out where to find your dates?

I don't know.

Tedleo.com, is that what it is?

Tedleo.com is actually down right now.

Really?

What happened?

I don't know.

I have no idea.

Yeah.

I think John Mayer is there at a computer going to take down his mother record.

Yeah.

No, yeah.

It's the information's out there.

That's very cryptic.

MatadorRecords.com.

This is not an episode of the X files.

I'm actually just saying- I'm not getting it self-promotion.

It's there.

Tedleo.com, MatadorRecords.com.

Oh, Matador, right?

You're with Matador now?

This is your first record with them or second record?

It is first record.

Your first record.

How do you like it there?

They're very nice folks.

They're when I get quality operation over there.

I don't think you like them.

That's about like how Zach answered the black people question.

That pause told us everything.

No, I'm sure they're very great.

Now you weren't black.

They weren't black.

What were they?

It's a poet.

Oh.

It was a poem.

Todd, as co-host, do you have anything to ask?

Ask Ted?

Sure.

You guys know each other really well, right?

I'm worried why his website is down.

Yeah, me too.

I'm not that worried about it, actually.

Zach, what do you have?

It's really nice to be on this show.

Is it- are you rapping?

Are you trying to rap it?

I'm trying.

I'm saying like ask Ted a question.

This is a once in a lifetime experience.

Oh, I've said a question.

Ted- uh, where did you record the album?

Well, Zach.

Uh, we recorded it in Brooklyn at a place called Seaside Lounge.

What did you do?

I don't know that was kind of a boring question.

I don't know why you asked that.

I was curious, but that was not a great question.

Is Ted short for something?

Yeah.

Do you want to guess which one it's short for?

Wasted.

Totally.

I never thought of that one before.

That's a good one, actually.

Theodore?

It's Theodore, yeah.

Good guess.

Is Theodore short for something?

Uh, nothing I know of.

Theodore Leonardo.

You should get that domain name and actually get a working website.

Now you prepared a second song for us, which is a cover, I believe.

Yeah, yeah.

I love your covers.

You've done a bunch of great ones.

You did six months in a leaky boat.

Yeah, that's right.

Yeah, but this is something new you've been working on lately.

Yeah, I had this Twitter moment, actually, recently, where I was actually sitting there thinking to myself just stupidly in an early morning haze.

It's kind of funny that our secretary of Homeland Security is almost the same name as the singer from Concrete Blonde.

And right at that moment...

Right at that moment...

You realize you were the only person to ever think that?

Well, but this is the thing.

You may be familiar with Julie Clousner.

Yeah, great author, great comedian.

Very funny.

Follow her on Twitter as well.

She tweeted that.

And almost the exact moment I thought about it.

And so I took that as a sign that I need to revisit their catalog and play a bunch of their songs.

Oh, really?

That's what I've been doing.

So great.

So you have one of their songs prepared for us?

Great.

Well, Ted Leo, everyone.

He's going to play another song for us.

Why to treat...

Is that anything to add before he plays it?

Good luck with the song.

Can I get a little more guitar?

It was customary to say good luck to people before they...

More or less.

Yeah, okay.

Good luck.

♪ ♪ Julie, baby, don't get crazy.

♪ Details and fences.

♪ Again.

♪ Different sand.

I know you've heard it all before.

So I was saying it anymore.

I just sit back and let you find your secret walls.

And I used to walk away.

I used to cry and I was trapped.

Still sometimes I feel a strange pain.

They'd make some.

You can cut that for the podcast too, right?

Oh, that was beautiful.

Ted, thank you so much.

That was embarrassing.

Thank you.

Ted Leo!

♪ ♪ Alright, well, we have come to the end of our little show, but before we go, we're gonna get into the part everyone loves, which is the plugs.

Alright, Ted, anything to plug other than that?

Never again.

Alright.

Zack, what do you wanna plug?

I'm doing a podcast at 9.30 tonight.

Eight minutes.

I know you joke a lot.

Tell me that's not true.

No, I'm not.

I don't have anything to plug, but...

I'm sure we'll see it on billboards.

Todd, what do you have to plug?

Todd, someone tried to get the chat going up.

You must have a lot of listeners in Seattle, right?

Yes, I do.

And you guys all have friends in Seattle, right?

So one guy nods now.

No, wait out.

February 11th, a big show.

You say February.

February.

Did I say that correctly?

Yes, you did.

You wanna cross, you wanna check that with the baby, see if that?

The 11th, you said.

A big show at the Moore Theatre.

With me, Tim Heidecker, Eugene Merman, Tig nothutto haro, Natasha Lijeiro, Neil Hamburger, music from James Mercer from the Shins, and Isaac Brock from Mottos Mouse.

Moore Theatre, cancer benefit, I'm hosting.

That's it.

APPLAUSE Winning anything to plug, being a baby.

Anyone else dying in your family that we need to know about?

I hope not.

I'm gonna be taking a nap later.

LAUGHTER And I hope to, you know, snuggle up and just take a nice nap.

And Ted, you're gonna be filming that for YouTube, right?

That's my next job.

All right.

It's gonna be my next job.

Well, I wanna thank also David Cross.

Thank him.

Thank all my guests, Zach Alifenakis, Ted Leo, Winnie the Winey Baby, John Gemberling, Todd Berry.

And I wanna thank everyone here.

Thank you so much for coming out.

It's been great here in New York.

I'll see you again sometime soon.

Thank you very much.
