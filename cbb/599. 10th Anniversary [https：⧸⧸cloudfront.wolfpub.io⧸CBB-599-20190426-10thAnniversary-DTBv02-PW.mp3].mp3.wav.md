♪ Comedy Bang Bang ♪ Sprinkle me with jimmies while I tinkle and I shimmy, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Hey, wait a minute.

That... I think that's the one.

I think that's it. I think we found our permanent catchphrase.

Bingo Boy sent us that and that...

I really liked how that sounded coming out of my mouth.

That is very akin to the old catchphrase, What's Up Hot Dog, that took us through the first couple of years.

Ever since then, I've been on a continuous quest to find the permanent catchphrase and...

Let me just say it again.

Sprinkle me with jimmies while I tinkle and I shimmy, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

That's it! I found it!

Oh my god, it just took ten years and I found the permanent catchphrase.

Wow, what a day. Congratulations Bingo Boy.

Something special coming out to you.

I have no idea what that would be.

I wish I hadn't have said that as a matter of fact, but...

Bingo Boy, thank you so much and welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

And this is a very, very special week.

My name is Scott Aukerman, the host. I've been the host of Comedy Bang Bang Low these ten years.

And if you've noticed the runtime on whatever podcast app you happen to be listening to...

for this very special tenth anniversary episode...

No, it's not a dream. It's not a hoax. It's not an imaginary tale.

The episode is ten hours long for ten years.

That's right, I decided to do a ten hour episode today, the longest podcast episode ever, I believe.

Call Mr. Guinness! Or Mrs. Guinness. The doctor's a woman, it could be Mrs. Guinness. I don't know.

I don't know who this Guinness fellow or woman is.

But call them, whoever they may be, and let them know that the world's longest podcast episode...

has finally been dropped here on April 29th, 2019, ten years after the very first Comedy Bang Bang podcast episode.

We have a very special show today.

Basically what happened was...

I started this show ten years ago.

It started out as a little tiny radio show on a local radio station.

And we would tape record it and then we would put it up as a podcast.

And it started out with very humble roots and humble beginnings.

And it grew into a show that quite a few people seem to like.

If you've never heard the show and are taking it upon yourself to listen to it for the first time...

Enjoy these ten hours.

I don't know why this would be your first episode to ever listen to, but welcome to you.

Basically what the show is, is it's the show where...

Gosh darn it, I talk to interesting people.

And that is the only connective thread between all of the people I'll talk to is...

Hopefully by gum they are interesting.

And as far as today's episode is concerned, I do believe some interesting people will show up.

Here's what I did.

When the show started ten years ago, it started out as a very straightforward comedy show...

where I was talking to comedians.

And then a few episodes in, suddenly people started barging into the studio and just coming on the show.

And I'll be honest, a lot of these people who did that were eccentric weirdos.

As I'm sure you can understand would be the case.

They have no sense of politeness, no sense of decorum.

They're just barging into a room and started talking on mic.

But that started something that we called our open door policy.

Really, that's what the show is.

Anyone who comes into the studio, who wanders into the studio and happens to open up this door into this tiny podcast studio...

They can get on mic and they can talk to me.

And that's what the show is all about.

Sometimes I have guests that I've booked, and sometimes I have guests who just wander in.

So today, what I thought would be really special is if I put out the call to all Comedy Bang Bang guests.

Every single person who has ever appeared on Comedy Bang Bang got the call and said, for these 10 hours, I am recording the very special 10th anniversary show.

Feel free to drop by at any time.

And so today's show is a true open door policy where I don't know who the guests are going to be.

I don't know what they're going to say, but they're going to just open up that door and they're going to wander in and we're going to talk to them.

And hopefully that'll be very interesting for you people for 10 hours.

And I know that some of our old favorites are going to drop by.

I don't know who they are, but people hopefully who have been on the show ever since the beginning, recent favorites.

If you've only been listening to the show for the past, I'm going to say three and a half weeks, let's just say.

Well, don't worry. I think maybe someone from those three and a half weeks will drop by.

Probably. I don't even know.

But and if you're one of our old, old listeners who have been listening since episode, a lot of people come up to me and they say, I've been listening since episode five or I've been listening since episode three.

Even people who have been listening since episode one.

And if you know, if you're a person who listened for a couple of years, then dropped off, then want to check back in.

And with this 10th anniversary episode, welcome back.

You're going to hear some of those old favorites and you're going to see you're not going to see anything unless you're looking at something very, very interesting.

And I pray that you are.

But you're going to hear some of your recent favorites.

You're going to hear some of your old favorites and you're going to hear some of those favorites from right in the middle, I believe.

So that's what we're going to do on this show today.

We're going to have a lot of fun and 10 hours, put on a pot of coffee and talk to your family and your wives and children.

Let them know you'll be gone for a little while.

Ten hours is longer than a lot of people's work days.

So I know a lot of people listen to this at work.

You will not even be able to listen to this episode at work in its entirety all the way through.

Hopefully you can you can, you know, listen to part of it.

Dip out for a while.

You know, save it over the next 10 days.

Listen to an hour for 10 days or, you know, if you want to listen to it all in one sitting.

If there are people out there who listen to it continuously, all in one sitting, let me know.

And a special salute coming out to you and to people of our all stars and stripes across this wonderful country in which we're recording and the countries that are wonderful outside of this country where podcasts are received.

So let us Terry know further.

I am Scott Aukerman again, and this is the podcast that started as a radio show and now has become a podcast for 10 years, was a TV show for a little bit for about five years in the middle.

Those were fun years and now has returned to being solely a podcast.

Let us pause no longer and let us get to whoever our first guest is.

So if there's someone out there, feel free to come on in here and.

Hey, hey.

Oh, my heavens.

What's going on here?

Oh, it's the Hainong Manzukas himself.

Jason Manzukas is here.

Lookie lookie here.

Lookie lookie.

Who's got a cookie?

Did you bring cookies?

Yeah, I brought it.

I brought a bunch of egg free cookies.

Jason the Ookie Monster. Oh, come on.

Yeah.

Egg free.

Because you're sterile?

Yep.

Yes, because I when I produce sperm, it's full of eggs.

Welcome to the show.

One of our oldest guests.

What a thrill.

What a thrill to be here.

How dare you?

As you are older than me by barely months.

I believe.

Yeah, I think.

Yeah, we I mean, we could be related.

We are.

How so?

Well, I well, you know, I was born in 70, but I believe I was conceived into 69.

So.

Hello, what do you mean?

Hello, how could you be conceived in a 69?

I don't know.

You know, stuff gets squirted out.

It gets all spread around, but it doesn't get spread in the right place.

Like you can if someone if your father and mother were 69 in picture it.

Oh, shit.

Picture your father and your mother just going to town.

Sixty nine style.

I'm going to picture my father and your mother.

OK, OK.

And this is what I'm talking about.

We could be related.

And she and it just wouldn't work because the sperm would not fertilize the egg in your mother's mouth.

Well, maybe if the dad was look, I don't want to get into it.

You don't want to go down the rabbit hole of how this works.

It's not that kind of a show.

It's very early to be saying that kind of a show.

I'm not that kind of performer.

Friend, happy anniversary.

Thank you so much.

Happy 10 year anniversary.

10 year anniversary.

Look at what you've done.

Not much.

I know.

I've sat here in a chair for a long time.

I you were on the first year.

I know because you were at the radio station.

I'm sure.

Yeah.

So you've been around since that was my first appearance was myself, Natasha Leggero and Bob Duker doing a ship of hope.

A ship called a ship called Hope.

Of course, Bob Duker doing a ship called Hope at the radio station.

That was my only radio station.

Bob is these days.

B.D.

Yes.

Big dog.

Oh, woof woof.

T-shirts available now in the gift shop.

Guys, snag that swag because it's fucking good.

I'm getting one of those shirts.

My only criticism that I told Scott before we started talking into these mics.

I want a long sleeve option.

Long sleeve option.

We'll see what we can do for you.

I may be able to sew some long sleeves on.

All right.

From another shirt.

Exactly.

Do you have any by the way?

Yeah.

Are you ever going to wear it?

You primarily wear white button down.

Yeah, I'll wear it on a hike or something.

Oh, OK.

I'll wear it like when I'm working out or you know.

Let's go hiking together.

Absolutely.

You know what I mean?

We don't live far from each other.

We should be hiking together.

We should be hiking every day together.

Shame on us.

Shame on us and shame on you.

Shame on me.

I will talk to you.

Shame on us.

And we've reset.

Oh, man.

Looking back on these 10 years, so many catch phrases.

You've been such a wonderful guest and so many T-shirts have sprung out of our conversations.

You have by the way is hang on man still the greatest selling T-shirt you've made.

I would say so other than the base, which is, of course, the logo.

Sure.

But hey, don't man.

Very, very popular.

Probably more popular than all joking salad.

But I would assume so.

No, I don't know.

It's a good one.

I mean, hey, my man is like I still am getting hang on man constantly in the world.

Of course.

It makes me very happy that that now an episode that is many years old is still reference is still valid in fans is still at the forefront of fans minds when they see us.

I think it's got about maybe two or three more years left.

Oh, I mean, our careers.

Oh, Jason, I mean, so many episodes you've done with so many wonderful people on them joining us.

Oh, yeah.

You mentioned Bob Duka, of course.

And we I remember we did some episodes where we were talking about how we were we were both I mean, I'm not telling you anything that you don't know, but we were both childhood actors on the same show on the same show.

And that's how we.

Yeah.

Here's what's true about us.

We are lifelong friends.

Right.

We've spent so much time together from childhood to adulthood talking to our to each other and to interesting people we've met.

That's all we like to do.

This was the show or and just recently we met Caitlin so fresh.

Caitlin.

Oh, so incredibly fresh.

We met as you were referencing now, Chip Gardner, the mayor of New York, the wannabe mayor of Hollywood.

Yes.

So many great people.

And of course, was who was the who was on that show that we did that when we were kids?

I don't really recall.

That was Chip.

Yeah, it was some weird mental block when I tried to think.

Yeah, no, it's very foggy.

It's very foggy for me, like the specifics of it.

I remember Chip Gardner.

I do remember Chip Gardner, a real character.

We met Dalton Wilcox.

Oh, Dalton Wilcox.

Amazing guy.

The cowboy poet, the cowboy poet or poet laureate of the cowboy West.

I feel like it's the poet laureate of the West.

The poet of the West, the Western poet.

Is that what it is?

It doesn't matter now.

Yeah.

Who cares?

We met the mailer Damon, the mailer demon mailer Damon.

Yes.

Right.

Yeah.

We met the real kooky people.

But right now it's just you and I. And that's the way I like it.

And this is what I wanted.

This is what I said to you.

I want 30 time uninterrupted minutes.

And you said, Jason, you got it.

Of course I did.

And there will be no, I would know that anywhere.

The world famous water skier hot dog.

That's right.

Thank you very much for recognizing my famousness across the world as a water skier.

What's going on?

You guys great to see you.

I'm excited to be here.

What did you know?

Jason and I would be here.

I know.

I just came in.

I just walked in.

They told me you guys had changed floors and I came to check out the new digs and whatnot.

Yeah.

Well, you're here.

It's so good to see you.

I mean, we haven't seen you in about a year, maybe it's been a least a year.

I don't know.

It's been a long time.

It's been a while.

We're getting them all in for the 10th anniversary.

What is the 10th anniversary or what?

Oh, this is a podcast.

Do you know we've been recording your voice?

No.

You know, you sign a release at the end of each of your appearances, allowing us to put your voice on the air.

I figured that was just a water skiing fan.

Do people ever approach you in the wild?

Like out in the world, do you ever people ever approach you in reference?

I don't know what a hot dog even looks like.

How would they recognize him?

Oh, that's, have you ever described yourself?

I have described myself.

I have incredibly powerful legs.

So sometimes, which is okay when people like do what they do in 80s movies where they start down at the feet and look up real slow.

That's right.

You got that opposite bodybuilder's body of like really big legs, really small torso.

Yeah, the opposite of those, what do they call the murder ball bodies?

All I did was mind one thing.

Hot dog is a reverse murder ball.

I'm a reverse murder ball.

Yeah.

I'm a reverse murder ball.

Bring them back to life ball.

But yeah, people, sometimes people do recognize me.

They'll recognize my voice.

Now that you mention it, cause that's funny and they'll say, wait, what's up hot dog?

Do you?

Oh, that's my old catchphrase.

Of course.

We can catch phrase now weird Al has, which, oh man, if I ever see that guy, I got to talk to him about that.

You should, but yeah, so they'll recognize.

Are you out there saying did do do do?

Why is that why they recognize your voice?

Uh, yes.

I'm walking around saying I practice, you know, I'm, I'm practicing.

Oh yeah.

I'm always practicing.

I was practicing singing.

Cause you know, as you know, as you guys know, I do know I am still my lifelong dreams to become a member of Shana and I, the number one interpreters of old time American rock and roll, which has a rotating membership.

So it has in some sense, I mean, they've been around for over 50 years and some people have come and gone.

And so it is not inconceivable that the very definition of a rotating membership.

I'm not sure why you're, are there any original members left in Shana?

Not at this point?

Are you kidding me?

Of course there are.

John Bowser Bauman, one of the original members is no longer, no longer part of Shana.

He hasn't been a part of me for a long time.

He was the glue.

Is he passed or is he real out there?

He tours with another group.

I don't know.

What's that group?

Not Shasha.

No, not Shasha was my group.

And that was man.

I've said, I've talked to you guys.

I've been on the receiving end of a very, very nasty lawsuit from Shana.

They sued me right into the ground and back.

I, in fact, I lost my water skis.

Oh no.

They specifically sued me for my water skis.

That's all they asked for?

They know they would incapacitate you.

Yeah.

Did you represent yourself?

Oh yeah.

I would not pay a lawyer.

You had a fool as a client.

No, my client was me.

Can I ask you a question?

Are you allowed to buy new water skis?

I suppose I can, if I could ever get the scratch together.

That's part of why I'm here.

You could just be, go back to being on sausages or whatever it was.

Yeah, no, I'm a big lung sausages.

Yeah.

I was the first guy to ever water ski on meat.

And a lot of people know that, but I could do that again.

I could probably do that again, but I, but I just very specific reason that I'm looking, I need water skis right now.

So you're here to need water skis right now.

I'm here to talk about a couple of different things.

So one of them is, has to do with, but let me ask you a question because shoot.

Yeah.

We're open Scott, Jaco and Donnie are still in the group.

And they were originally there from the sixties.

They played at Woodstock and everything.

Well, yes, they play with now you're speaking of.

Yes.

This is the other thing I'm here to talk about.

I got two big things to talk about.

I don't care what order I bring them out.

That there is going to be a Woodstock 2019.

2019, which would be the 60th anniversary of the original Woodstock concert.

That's incredible.

They must be getting all the old acts back.

I've had, well, Jimmy Hendrix is no longer with us.

Who else was there?

Oh, Crosby, Stills and Nash were there.

They didn't make it right.

They sang the song about it because they couldn't make it.

Oh, is that what happened?

They were there.

Oh, like Joni Mitchell wrote the song.

Joni Mitchell wrote the song and she was not there.

She was not there.

Maybe Neil Young didn't go.

Yeah, but they must be getting everybody back.

That's exciting.

Almost everybody from the original lineup.

The Killers, they're coming back, right?

Green Day?

Almost everybody from the original.

Green Day was at Woodstock, yeah, 94 or whatever.

Oh, 99.

99.

They were like the mud throwing of the mud, I remember.

Is Puddles of Mud going to be the guy speaking of?

I don't see them here.

I have in front of me the list of absolutely everybody that's going to be there.

Let me say, first of all, that almost everybody that performed in the 1969 Woodstock is dead.

Almost all of them.

Rightfully so.

I mean, I'm talking about the new ones.

I think that's one of the top things that people know about you.

When they think of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Cats is right up there.

I mean, I'm talking about the new ones.

So, in order to bring the stage production to the cinema, what they have done is they have come up with this technology.

It's a computer and it generates an image.

And the idea is that it will take actors...

You're talking about CGI? Is that a computer-generated image?

So I say that's a time saver.

Yeah, that is, yeah. Ever since Terminator 2, the Judgment Day, I believe it was...

That's a time adder.

I believe they created it for that movie or the Michael Jackson...

Oh boy, let's not talk about him. Black and white video.

Will you see my new production, Time Adder?

It's about a snake who controls time.

I might, I might.

How long is the show?

It's approximately three hours, no intermission.

It's a real Avengers endgame.

Pee before you walk in there, otherwise you might miss Thanos snap.

It's very important that that film be three hours because these things actually happened. I'm assuming.

I don't know that it's a historical document of actual events.

I just assumed with a running time of three hours, there was nothing they could cut from the story because the story all happened.

Well, there's a lot of characters they got to meet. I haven't seen it yet. It's out by now.

Howard the Duck.

Well, he was at the end of Guardians of the Galaxy, so maybe he gets in there.

Why didn't they show him turning into Pepper when everyone else did at the end of that one?

Did you say turning into Pepper?

Yes, everyone looked like they turned into Pepper.

I don't know that it's Pepper. I thought they were like sort of ashes that were blowing away.

Is that what you thought?

This is what I thought.

Well, you're incorrect.

You think it was Pepper.

You think like the opposite of Lot's wife, everyone just turned into Pepper?

Exactly. I assumed it was a biblical illusion.

And also, tip of the hat to Marco Polo.

I think there would be confusion with Pepper Potts, you know? I mean, she'd be like, hey, why didn't I? Why didn't it happen to me?

How many people are named Pepper?

I think three.

Including the fictional Pepper Potts?

Yes. And then two real people.

It would be a fun name to have.

It would be a fun name to give.

Better to give than to receive.

I'm going to call you Pepper.

Okay, thank you. I will be known as Pepper.

All right.

So, computer-generated images.

Yes. They're going to take the actors and computorially shrink them down to the size of cats.

So when you see them on the screen, you're seeing the world through the eyes of cats.

Everything will be sized as to a cat's perspective.

I see. So all the actors will be approximately two feet high and we'll see them, you know, next to a garbage can which is twice as big as them with fish bones in it and all that kind of...

Now you've got it, Pepper.

Those garbage cans will be overflowing with fish bones.

I hope so.

Everywhere you look, rubbish bins piled high with the skeletons of fish.

Will other famous cats be in this movie?

I think if you have a movie called Cats, it can't just be about your cats.

Like, it's all cats, right?

Well, yeah.

Heathcliff.

This was not my wish, but I acceded you to the producer's demands that famous cats shall be seen in cameos, much like Stan Lee.

So just one of the cats will be on the train and then they'll look to their left and Garfield will be there?

Every cat, there'll be many famous cats. Anytime you see a cat reading a newspaper, don't blink because that cat will lower the newspaper and say something like, he really tugged my rub-dumb.

And it'll be Morris from the Night Live's cat food commercial.

So we have Morris, we got Garfield, we got Heathcliff. Try and think of other famous cats.

Do you understand?

I saw recently on Twitter, someone had discovered Morris the cat after many years.

Had discovered him?

Well, this was a younger person who had no idea that Morris ever existed and found a calendar devoted to Morris the cat.

Right.

People need to understand, he was hugely famous.

Wasn't he? He was the cat that chased the covered wagon?

No, that was a dog.

That was a dog? Which dog? What am I thinking of?

You're thinking of the dog that chased the covered wagon.

But what was the company?

Purina? It was...

That's how effective advertising is. We cannot remember.

And those were everywhere.

Obviously I was an adult when those commercials happened, but as certain people were children, I know they were fascinated by the tiny covered wagon.

The tiny covered wagon. I remember the colors, the red and white checkered, but I don't remember what it was selling.

It was, was it Gainesburgers? I remember there was a brand.

I don't recall.

A brand branded the dog food.

I thought you meant branded the dog. That would be a terrible end of that commercial.

No, no. The dog was very much in control.

Morris the cat was about nine lives, right?

Cat food. He was a finicky cat.

That's right. He didn't like...

Oh, I wish I had written him into the musical.

I'm Morris the cat and here's what I'll say. I'm finicky and I don't care what you say.

If you give me cat food that I don't like, I'm going to make your life miserable.

Hmm. First rhyme that came to mind? Unacceptable.

What do you think? Like?

Nope. Don't think about it.

Okay. All right. Will not.

Don't think on it at all.

What an incredible movie this is. The three famous cats, Morris, Heathcliff and Garfield.

And I can think of no other famous cats.

Top cat.

Top cat. Oh, okay. Yeah. There, I guess there would be some cartoon. Is Tom or Jerry a cat?

The two racist Chinese cats from Lady of the Tramp.

It could be in there. Is Tom a cat? Tom.

Tom is a cat. Jerry is a mouse.

That's right. Yes. So he's in there.

Yes.

Wow.

They're all in there.

What a movie this is going to be.

The cat from apt pupil.

Wow.

What about the cat from outer space?

The cat from outer space has returned to his home dimension.

Oh, you couldn't get him?

He was unavailable.

Oh, terrible.

I'm very pleased for him, of course, that he gets to see his family once again.

But a loss for us.

Sad news.

Too sad.

Terrible stuff. Terrible, terrible stuff.

Terrible stuff, Elliot.

So this is incredible technology that and this movie sounds like a winner, a dynamite, but it still hasn't answered the question of why you are incredibly small.

They wrote. I thought it would be a lark to see myself shrunken down to cat's eyes.

Unfortunately, the technology is too good.

This is the technology they're using for the movie is what happened to you?

They're not just making the actors appear smaller to save money on sets.

So they wouldn't have to build giant sets.

They're not going to use sets at all.

Oh, wow.

They're going to film it out in the wild.

Wow.

And they're not going to CGI anyone.

Well, they're going to.

It's computer generated.

Infantilizing?

Infantilizing, yes.

Wow. So they actually are shrinking all of the actors.

Well, not now. They just did it to me.

Just as a test?

They realized it was a mistake.

I volunteered to be the first.

I wanted to see what I would look like a little kitty cat.

Did they ever say that they had the technology to put you back to your normal size?

They haven't said.

And believe me, I've asked.

They haven't returned these emails?

They have.

I should call them.

I've been I've been doing all of this via email.

First do an email, then do a text and then actually leave a message and we'll see.

Oh, when they get that message.

Because the text is next.

The text is, I don't know if you got my emails, but am I stuck at cat size forever?

Day after dentist?

Yes.

And so there I will call them and say, what's up?

I saw I saw my red receipts. I know that you read my text.

You can say my emails went to spam.

Oh my gosh, he's writing a musical right in front of us.

But I'll know that's just a piece of ham.

How dare you refuse my text?

What's next?

My hand around your necks.

Threatening them with murder.

I mean, that's a way to raise the stakes in a theatrical production.

It's a massage.

Ah, I see.

Neck massage.

Neck massage, of course.

Yes.

Well, I guess that explains why you're this tall.

No further questions?

I rest my case.

That's the only thing you wanted to know.

Well, I look, I always want to know every single thing about you.

I mean, I assume that you'll be going to the premiere this size and...

Oh, I hope not. That's yards away.

Do you understand I'm sleeping in my own top hat?

Why don't you sleep in your own house in the bed?

It's just, it'll be bigger than...

The bed's too big now. It's terrifying.

What's the biggest bed you ever slept in?

California King.

What if it were a little bit bigger? You'd be terrified.

I guess it would be like an alien wasteland of just, you know, all...

Oh, Wasteland, T.S. Eliot.

Did he write Wasteland? Wow!

He certainly did.

Incredible!

Did he write Westworld?

Why are you asking that?

I don't, well, I'm just throwing out things that he may have written.

I have no idea who wrote Westworld.

He did not.

Okay.

It was Michael Crichton.

Oh, good. Okay, great.

Oh, good.

Great. Good for him.

Oh, good. I'm so glad Michael Crichton wrote Westworld instead of T.S. Eliot.

I'm good for him.

Good for him.

He got to it first. Great.

The most eloquent giant, Michael Crichton.

Probably the most literary giant we've ever had on this earth.

Is he a giant? Really?

He was.

How tall was he?

Rest in peace.

How tall was he?

Six nine.

Wow! That is tall.

I wonder how he would ever imagine characters shorter than him.

Like in Disclosure?

Well, I think that's all he did.

He positioned himself above everyone else and said, look at these little people with their little lives.

Now Jurassic Park makes sense because he was as tall as a T-Rex.

Exactly.

And he wanted to see the screams.

He wanted people to live in terror of him.

He probably wanted to bite people's heads off, just like those T-Rexes did in the movie.

Well, who doesn't?

Well, that's true.

Haven't you ever, haven't you ever, Scott Rigg, if you're honest, Pepper, haven't you ever wanted to bite someone's head off literally?

I mean, you are looking like a snack right now, I gotta say.

Two feet high? I mean, I don't know what the...

I don't believe that's what that expression means.

I don't know what the rules are.

I don't think looking like a snack means I would like to, I would like that person's entire being to sustain me between meals.

I'm just saying that I think there must be something in the rule book that they call laws where, you know, if someone is a certain height, you can eat them.

I know this. I am allowed to play baseball.

Good. Yes.

There's nothing in the rules.

Nothing in the rules says that you cannot play baseball.

However, there is the law of nature that says...

No, that's not a good example.

The laws of morality.

Do not eat me, Scott Rigg. Please.

I don't know. You look so tasty right now.

Do I? I just look like me, only small.

I know, but you're sweating almost like you've been over an open flame.

Do you have a certain rosy color to you?

That's what you love is hot, is just wet meat.

Piping hot, wet meat.

Piping hot? Piping hot, wet meat.

Wouldn't that be a treat if I could see you on a spit?

I'm really fascinated what plot you're going to use to weave all of these songs that you've been writing together.

Well, I mean, you saw what I did with Cats, right?

That's true.

Plot not necessary.

Well, Andrew Lloyd Webber, or Lord Webber, if I may be so bold.

You should be.

This is a terrible situation for you, and I'm sorry it happened to you, and I sincerely hope that the next time I see you, you won't be looking so tasty.

You'll be full grown, and I'll say, eh, too much.

I suppose I hope that as well.

And I definitely will not eat you right now, because we're old friends.

You've been on the show for as long as we've been doing it, you've been on the show.

We've been the best of frenemies.

You can't eat me now.

I am very, very hungry today, but I will abstain.

Yes, eat something not alive.

As a favor to the queen.

Oh, the queen.

I just remember the queen's corgis.

What's wrong with the queen's corgis?

What if they see me in this state?

They won't know me as a friend.

They'll think that you're a cat?

I don't know what they'll think I am, but they will think that I am smaller than they are.

Right! They'll chase you around!

They will chase me around.

Make me their plaything, their vicious plaything.

They'll bat you around like a cat bats yarn around.

They'll bite into me and then shake their little fat heads.

Oh, no! You have to stay away from the queen then.

I'm... but... I do so love the queen.

I know you do!

She is my sovereign.

I need to see the queen.

Be careful then. Ask her to lock up her corgis before you get there.

She'll never do it.

Those corgis run the show.

Really?

Perhaps her wizard, the court's wizard would turn me back into a man again.

This is a good plan. I didn't know the court had a wizard.

I guess they've had one ever since Merlin days.

Of course they have.

Oh, okay. Well then this is the way to go.

That's why you here in America, why don't you have a wizard?

I don't know. I mean turn not to science.

Turn to magic instead.

Turn not to science.

Turn to magic instead.

If you'd like to have a silly old giraffe on your head.

And you're tired of sleeping in that big old bed.

Turn your thoughts to science instead.

Wah wah. This is good. I want a writing credit on this.

You'll get one for the wah wah.

Has this been good?

This has been a good visit. I appreciate you dropping by.

It wouldn't be a 10th anniversary special without Andrew Lloyd Webber dropping by.

10th anniversary of what?

Oh, did you not know that it's the 10th anniversary of this podcast?

That can't be so.

Because it's too long or too short?

Too long, obviously.

No, you, I would.

10 years!

The show is in its infancy the first time you drop by.

Ugh. And it's still going.

Still chugging away like that roller skate train.

Why?

People like it?

Why?

I, look, I don't have the answer to that really.

It's one of those unknowable questions.

Ms. Godric, I feel terrible. I haven't brought you a gift of any kind.

I will say congratulations to you.

Give me just a little bite off maybe one of your fingies or...

Ugh, my fingers. I need them.

For what? Composing?

If I hold a teacup, where does the pinky go?

How about at one of those toesies?

No, I don't want to lose my balance.

Then I don't know what I could eat off you. Maybe a bit of the shoulder?

All right.

Ugh!

Oh, it hurts.

You broke the skin.

Those nooks. Those crannies.

I've got to get out of here.

It's too much. I need more.

Aaaah!

Thank you Andrew Lloyd Webber!

I'm running away as fast as I can. You can't catch me. I'm Andrew Lloyd Webber man.

Ah, Andrew Lloyd Webber.

One of our oldest, oldest friends.

Him and his topping hat.

Oh, so good to see him.

He's been around since the very beginning.

And, uh, wow.

I mean, this is a blast from the past.

A true blasting from the pasting.

Wow. And, uh, I think that, uh...

Happy birthday to you.

Wait, who's this?

Happy birthday to you.

I know the sound of that voice.

Happy birthday to Scott, my legitimate son.

Uh oh. Oh, I know who this is.

Happy birthday to you.

Hello, Scott.

Bob Duker.

How are you?

I'm great. It's not my birthday, but, but, uh...

Well, in a sense it is, because I understand that your radio program is 10 years old.

It's not a radio program anymore. It was when you first came on it.

I, I, I, I want to, I, okay, I just want to get off the, right off the bat.

I will never understand the difference between radio and podcast, so I want you to save your time.

Okay, thank you.

But, Scott, I thought this was a wonderful opportunity for us to reconnect.

I have not seen you in, in quite a bit of time.

Many, many, many, many months.

Many moons, as they say.

Many moons. Yes, yes.

Have passed over, uh, overhead.

That's right. And, uh, for those people who don't know, I was married to your beautiful, beautiful mother for a brief period of time.

Brief period of time. A matter of months, as I recall.

A matter of months. Six, six profound months.

And it was later in your life, you were already a beautiful, fully grown man.

I think I was in my thirties, as I recall.

You were in your thirties, but you'll always be my little boy.

However, I never got to spend time with you when you were a ten-year-old boy.

So I thought, what better opportunity now that your radio cast is ten years old...

Podcast, sure, yeah.

...that don't understand, that I could use this as an opportunity to make some of the connections that fathers and sons do when the young boy is ten.

So I, I, from what I'm understanding, you're using my podcast birthday of ten to now try to interact with me, me personally as a ten-year-old.

You are a sharp little tool in the shed, my boy.

Not so little, maybe not so sharp.

You are just adorable.

What were you doing earlier today, your rascal, catching bullfrogs?

I was out there trying to make some dandelion wine.

Yeah, there you go, putting some pennies on train tracks.

Sure.

Watch out for that hobo jungle.

Bob, for those of you who don't remember you, you're one of our earliest guests.

You are a man of certain maladies, and you are currently wearing a neck brace, several arm guards.

Yes.

What looks to be a makeshift cast or two?

It is makeshift, yes, yes. I had, I had, I'm a traditionalist.

I like plaster casts. I don't like these plastic things, these newfangled.

I go for analog casts, but I refuse to cover it up when I go in the shower.

So, my casts will disintegrate, and what I do is use chewed up newspaper to create a binding adhesive, so that's what you're saying.

Sort of a papier-mâché effect.

A papier-mâché.

You look akin to a pinata.

Thank you.

Not a compliment, but uh...

That's how I'll take it.

Okay, great.

Life is a matter of perspective.

So, how do you want to celebrate me as a ten-year-old? How do you plan on doing this?

Well, some of the things that we never got to do during your formative years, especially your tenth year, why don't we play a game of catch?

Oh, uh, sure. Do you have some sort of a ball or...

I have a ball right here. You ready?

Yeah, okay.

Here we go.

Oh, god. The arm on you is not strong at all.

Not very strong.

And you weren't using your right arm for some reason. Are you a southpaw?

No, no, no, but I do have ball dyslexia, so...

Okay, let me throw it back. I'm going to try not to do it too hard, but you know, I was... maybe you don't know this about me, I played triple-A ball, so I'm going to try not to throw it too hard if that's okay.

Okay.

Ow. Okay. Try this again.

Yeah, you were able to dribble it approximately six inches.

Let me try it with my other hand here. Okay? Here we go.

Ow!

Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

No wonder you have ball dyslexia.

I'm sorry. Hold on. You know what I think the problem is? I can't properly throw with this brace on. Let me just get this.

Oh, it's been a while since I've taken...

Ow! Ow! Sorry! Those are wrist nets. They live... they thrive on moisture.

They all tried to get into my mouth.

Oh boy. Oh, you know what? It's a good source of protein.

Don't worry about it. You can just open your mouth like a whale and eat it like krill.

You know what? Why don't we leave that for a moment? I feel satisfied that we've gotten a place in the past.

Yeah, one back and forth apiece.

This is one of the many ways that fathers and sons bond.

You're ten years old and you're starting to notice that things are happening with your body.

Not much happened to me at ten years old, as I recall.

Well, if you're like me, you had a foul thicket of Brillo pad-like hair.

I don't know how many people are actually like you, Bob. I think you're very unique.

You are one of a kind as well. But you're probably wondering how the bees and the birds work.

Birds and the bees. Sure.

Here we go. I just wanted to let you know. So, when a man likes a woman, he asks her out to dinner for a strip mall Indian food buffet.

They split a bottle of warm white wine and if all goes well, one thing leads to another. And he places a penis pump onto his penis.

Now, when the pump can be run by hand or by batteries, you place it over the penis. You pump air out of the cylinder so that a vacuum is created.

Now, the vacuum draws blood into the shaft of the penis, which causes it to swell and become erect.

Don't be shy! Come on! This happens to everybody. This is just how nature works.

Now, once that penis is erect, with the help of lubricant, you painfully slide the retaining band down into the lower end of the penis.

And then you remove the pump after releasing the vacuum.

And at which point you have a limited time to shove that fraudulent erection, this nature-defying phallus, into the hopefully moist enough postmenopausal yoni of the reciprocant.

Much like I did to your mother.

Postmenopause? I don't know if that's relatable to every 10-year-old child, the postmenopausal part.

This is just how things work, my boy.

Okay.

You know what? I feel like you're not really understanding what I'm saying.

I've never necessarily needed the pump action at this point?

You will. You will.

Okay. How early did that come for you?

Seventeen. Yeah.

And you had no interest in sex before that?

Oh, I did. Yes. Yes. I was a furious masturbator.

You were mad that you were doing it, or you did it furiously?

Both. Both. I was raised Catholic, so I just hated every second of it.

What are you now? I don't think we've ever talked about religion.

I'm an agnostic pagan.

I don't know how that works.

Well, I mean, it's an ever-evolving thing. I'm a very spiritual person, as you'll see, actually.

One of the things I've been working on since I last saw you is, you probably know that I've read the book jackets of well over a thousand self-help books.

I thought you actually broke open those books and read something that was on some of the pages.

They usually chase me out of the bookstore before I can get to the actual books.

But I've retained a lot of this information. I've applied it to my life.

And not only that, but after 60-some years on this planet, I've acquired a lot of knowledge that I feel excited about passing on to other people.

So I've been working on a book.

You are writing a book? Oh, a book title.

Well, a book title, yes. And then once I figure out a title, then I'll write the book.

I guess that's a good thing to kind of think about what you're going to talk about before you actually start writing.

Absolutely. Absolutely.

You know, if you're building a house, you start with the paint job and then you build the foundation. That's how it works.

Okay.

So, you know, maybe the game of catch didn't go quite the way I wanted to.

Maybe the sex talk was a little overwhelming for you, though it will be extremely applicable to you in just a matter before you even know it.

I'm definitely going to save this podcast for later.

Great.

But I just thought I would read off to you a list of the potential books that I will write. These are autobiographical and self-help in nature.

These are titles that you've brainstormed?

Mm-hmm.

And you're trying to ascertain which one you're going to use?

Yes. Yes.

Okay. Great.

Let me just- So this is a- oh, okay, this is a list.

Yeah, I wrote it on various scraps of paper and bits of my cast. Some of it's pretty soggy.

Yeah. Okay. Hopefully it's readable.

Okay. I think I can- I think I can- All right. This is Bob Duker's list of potential book titles.

Please.

This is Bob Duker's list of potential book titles.

Great. Wow, that's so many to choose from.

Yes.

I think you might have more than one book in you.

Do you really think so?

I think if you can expand on any of those ideas.

Let's get together and brainstorm.

Oh, I don't know.

I can come over.

It sounds like you've done the majority of the brainstorming.

You just simply need to get these ideas on paper.

Well, you know how hard making decisions is for me.

Or paper mache.

Right. Mache.

Mache, sorry.

Yes.

Yeah.

I can't tell you how incredibly proud I am of you.

Bob, thank you so much. It means the world to me that you showed up on such a special occasion for me.

Yes, it was, you know, I came here from Great Peril.

Where's Great Peril?

Great Peril. It's near the spearmint rhino over by that mall, that Egyptian themed mall.

Oh, is that what they're calling that neighborhood now?

Yeah.

Okay, yeah.

Is that just because you started living there?

Yeah. Yeah.

I somehow, in my late middle age, I secrete a hormone that attracts feral dogs.

So there's been a problem there.

Well, Bob, thank you so much for making the time.

It's like a dark Wes Anderson film over there. All the dogs chasing me.

Oh my gosh.

Thank you.

Thank you for making the time and the journey as well.

Absolutely.

How did you get here? Did you walk the entire way?

I took a couple of buses and then I walked. And then, yes.

So you took a couple of buses and then you walked and yes.

Yes.

That's it. Okay.

Well, Bob, thank you so much for being here.

Actually, I did take, I did take, have you heard about the bird scooters?

Yeah. Oh, I've seen those. Yeah. They're just lying around everywhere now.

A friend of mine is starting a program like that, but it's for coffee can stilts.

So that's how I made a big part of my way over here.

Which friend of, which friend is this?

That's my friend Odell.

Odell. What is his last name or first name?

Cigarette.

Odell Cigarette?

Yes. Yes.

Oh, Bob.

So if you see, if you see those, it's, it's, it's a, he's not hooked up to the internet yet.

So you just leave cash on the ground.

You take them.

And hopefully at some point he picks up the cash.

He'll come for you.

Okay, good. This is a good business plan.

It's a great business plan.

Yes.

Bob, thank you so much.

Thank you.

Please don't, don't make it so long before the next time you come back.

I will hang out with you any time you even start to think about it.

I don't necessarily mean that, but I, I think let's split the difference on the, an error on the side of never coming back.

All right.

I, but Bob, I love you too.

Oh my God. I have waited so long to hear that.

Don't say another word.

I want those to be the last words that I hear from you until I see you seconds from now.

Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.

Quiet.

Sorry.

Don't speak.

He's still here.

The door is over there.

If you.

Oh, thank God.

He's gone.

Don't speak.

We need to soundproof this better.

Bye, Bob.

Okay, look, we need to take a break.

We are just a little bit of the ways through our 10 hour show.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

More of your favorite guests will be right back after this.

Comedy bang bang.

Welcome back.

And wow, what a show already.

I mean, we're just a fraction of the way through the show.

Already. We've had three of our favorite guests.

I wonder who else could be coming through that door next.

I who's this.

Hi, Scott.

It's me, John Ham.

Oh my gosh.

Jonathan Ham.

That's me.

Hamilton.

Is Hamilton about you?

It's it's a musical based on the story of my life told through Alexander Hamilton's life.

Oh, I see.

I wondered why they have that extra M in Hamilton.

Hamilton.

Right.

That's actually how you pronounce it.

Mmm, molten.

And you have to rub your stomach while you do it.

Ham.

That was the original review.

Ben Brantley's original review was.

Mmm, molten.

How are you, John?

John, whatever.

Happy anniversary.

Thank you so much.

One of our oldest friends on the show.

You did one of the earliest episodes and you've been on so many times.

I remember when you were on Terrestrial Radio.

That is right.

That's how the show started.

And you came into the old radio station.

Indie 103.

That's right.

And you've been a great friend of the show.

You let alone the podcast.

I thought I would come by just to help you celebrate.

That's great.

So what are we going to do?

Do a lot of the characters that I'm known for on the show.

This show does not have characters.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Well, I'm just like, mostly that's what I'm known for.

I come on and I do a lot of characters.

I believe you did do Chupacabra's brother.

Chupacabra's brother, Chupacabro.

Which was literally just me stealing Kroll's bit.

So, anyway.

Right, yes.

And you've been on the television show.

And when I say that, I mean the comedy bang bang television show.

Because everyone knows that you've been on other television shows.

Kimmy Schmidt, not a television show.

No.

A Netflix offering.

A piece of content.

A streaming, streamable content.

I love content now.

You're, do you like starring in content?

So much content.

We sling so much tent out there.

So much content to contend with.

Content.

It should be, it should be contend.

Content.

I'm content with all this content.

That I have to contend with.

We should just call it content.

There's a continents worth of content that I have to contend with.

And it makes me incontinent.

Incompetent.

Yes.

You have to be incompetent not to be on content at this point.

You have to be incompetent not to love all the content, all the sweet, sweet tent that John Hamm.

Sometimes I watch so much content, I will get incontinent.

That's right.

And I have a mess to clean up.

That's true.

What do you do when you're incontinent, by the way?

Well, you wear a diaper.

Yeah, are we selling, do we have a diaper sponsorship yet with this show?

You sponsor?

Yeah.

So, if you've been reading this copy, I guess we have a diaper sponsorship here.

Hi, I'm John Hamm for Depends Adult Undergarments.

When do you wear Depends?

Depends.

That's the whole point.

How you feeling?

Well, it depends.

You got like a loose splatter, then I'd throw Depends on.

That's prime Depends.

Prime Depends time.

Yeah.

That's great.

Thank you so much for reading that.

I appreciate it.

That was very short, but it was just basically me pitching it.

I noticed you didn't do the personal endorsement.

The story where I- Where you talk about how you wear Depends.

The first time I needed a Depends, and that is the proper way to refer to them in the plural, even if you're talking about one Depends.

One Depends.

You do not say that.

One Depends.

Oh, interesting.

One Depends on when one needs Depends.

What was the first time that you ever needed one?

I found out I was in the deep end.

Oh, how did you find out?

Well, all of a sudden, I realized I needed a, I was in the deep end, I needed a Depends.

And so the good news was box of them right there.

Just box, that's- If you're having a pool party- The weird thing is, it's part of the Emmy gift bag is a box of Depends.

If you're having a pool party, I think it's great to have just like a dispenser.

You know what I mean?

Grab one.

Like, I'm in the pool.

Hey, I think I need a Depends.

Because first of all, peeing in the pool, not cool.

You know, I used to see those signs up at people's pool of like, you know, welcome to our ool, of course.

There is no pee in our pool.

Or we don't swim in your toilet, so why do you pee in our pool?

But yours is better.

Peeing in our pool, not cool.

I would love to, can we make some of these as swag of just your face smiling with that as a quote?

Absolutely.

Okay, great.

Peeing in the pool, not cool.

But I do like the idea of a Depends dispenser.

A Desp- A Depends- Penster?

Something like that, where you're just like, oh man, I'm going to need three of these.

And then you're ready.

Also, by the way, better than a towel.

Throw one of those on, it just wicks it away.

Exactly.

Why are we, why is everyone using towels these days?

I'll say this, fashionable.

They do look good.

Have you seen the new styles of Depends?

They're slimmer.

They are, yes.

They have a nice slim cut on them.

They have a nice slim cut, a European cut, I think I would say.

Because they hired, this is very interesting, I know his name has been in the news a lot, Masimo Giannulli.

Oh yes.

The husband of Lori Loughlin.

Lori Loughlin, yeah, of course.

The owner is a designer.

He is responsible for the new- He did the new Depends, really?

The new Depends look.

Was it due to the fact that when he saw the indictment, he shit his pants and he was like, I should get involved in this?

I think it was pre-that, but fortunately, again, he had the gift box right there.

He had it on.

And he had to throw that on when the feds come and knock it.

When they served the subpoena to him.

There's another- Let me, hold on.

Hold on.

Let me just throw these on.

Let me get my Depends on.

Sir- I think if anyone knocks on your door, you should throw Depends on.

Just in case.

Just in case, because it depends on who it is at your door.

You don't know if you're going to shake your pants.

Depends.

You said it right there.

It depends.

Right there.

They're going to be thrilled with this endorsement, by the way.

By the way, this is still all- I'm reading all from the copy.

This is still, yeah, this is a long, long ad.

It's really longer.

It's much longer than it looked.

It's scripted between you and me.

It's very odd.

But we're so good at playing it, it just seems off the cuff.

It seems very, very natural.

Yeah.

You are, of course, one of America's great, what am I trying to say?

Actors?

Sure.

I'll take it.

You were on the Maddest of Men show, where everyone was- it was like a contest between you guys of how angry can we get?

That was part of it.

That's how it started, right?

It was going to be a game show.

You took all of the people's blood pressure.

And it was like, whoever's maddest wins.

And then all of a sudden, weirdly, they found this narrative.

They were like, what if it was more about, instead of a competition, like a reality show, what if it was a little more scripted?

Yeah.

So it was a hybrid show for a while.

For a while.

And then once they kind of gave into it, they were like, you know what, this is the most interesting part of it.

Let's just keep this, and then we'll get rid of the rest.

By the way, that's the creative process.

That is the process.

But all that stuff on the cutting room floor, John.

We could do a whole eight more seasons.

I would love to visit the cutting room floor one day.

It's filthy.

It really is the filthiest place in Hollywood.

There's so much stuff.

Just pick it up.

Pick it up.

Pick it up off the floor.

No one says it has to be, it says stay there.

No, it's called the cutting room floor for a reason.

Yes, it has to go on the floor.

Sure.

Yes, but pick it up.

Pick it up.

It's infuriating.

It almost makes me want to cancel out all of the Emmys that you won for that show.

Just all of the one?

All of the one.

And it was almost like, oh shit, this is the last season.

We got to give this guy one.

Isn't Cranston nominated?

All right, he's not fine here.

Oh, finally.

Cranston.

You and Cranston.

Cranny.

All those nooks and crannies.

What if he teamed up with someone like John Nook and they came out with a show, Nooks and Crannies.

Nooks and Crannies.

On CBS.

I mean, talk about content.

Talk about content.

I mean, solving crimes.

Solving crimes.

It's like Rizzoli had aisles.

Mm-hmm.

Cranny's got nook.

Yeah, of course.

I mean, and they wouldn't even have to solve crimes sometimes.

They could just like- I think a road trip.

Solve the crimes of the heart.

Sure.

Sometimes.

Talk about who did you wrong, Nook?

Do a big sideways type road trip.

Absolutely.

Exactly.

I would watch that.

But with white wine.

Yes, exactly.

White wine doesn't get its due.

I would watch the literal shit out of that.

Wouldn't you?

You would watch that until it had no more shit in it?

No more shit.

Until it was just spent.

Just shit free.

Right there in the depends.

Right.

Just filled up.

Depends full of nooks and crannies.

Those new depends, by the way, with the little gauge on it of like how full- When it's full.

Yeah.

Those are- Genius.

Very, very helpful.

Genius.

It was weird how it went off on a bright, crancy tangent.

On a tangent about Mad Men and stuff.

But this is, look, depends.

They're expert marketers.

They know what's up.

By the way, that's the tagline.

We're done reading it.

It's like, depends.

They know what's up.

And that is the end of the advertisement.

Finito.

It is weird that the advertisement is still- Has that.

But it's also still continuing.

Yeah, it's very strange.

It's strange that this is still part of it.

They do a fake out.

It's so strange.

It's almost like a Marvel movie where there's something at the end.

The really weird thing is that the whole 10th anniversary, 10 hour podcast is really just an advertisement for- Just an advertisement for it depends.

If we don't land this depends account, by the way, I know this is all on spec.

And you have a lot of experience in the Mad Men thing about- Yeah.

Or we're going to get bought by McCowan and Rogers or something.

Yeah, exactly.

Do you even remember any of the details of the show that you were on?

I remember some, but it was a long time.

Let me test you.

All right, go.

What was the name of your character?

David Don Dick Whitman Draper.

Okay, great.

I think that might be right.

I have no idea.

Some of them are.

What is the name of the company you worked for in episode one?

Depends.

Yes, exactly.

And what were the names of your children?

Jean was the youngest.

Jean, mean Jean.

Mean Jean, tiny Jean.

Tiny, tiny Jean.

Tiny Jean, his full name, but William Jean.

William Jean.

Named after his maternal grandfather.

Okay.

Then there was Bobby, the middle child.

The middle child Bobby.

Famously played by, I think over the course of the show, six different actors.

Six different actors, really?

Yeah, we had a lot of Bobbies.

Why is that?

Because they would have aged- They kind of grew too fast or too something.

They got hired on other shows because they didn't really work that much.

And then the oldest, the apple of Don's eye, played by Kiernan Shipka, Sally.

Sally.

And, and there were no more children?

I can't remember.

Not that I know of.

Depends.

Not that I know of.

Good, good ad.

And what, who's the dude, you know, the dude with the white hair, what was his character's name?

Roger Sterling, I think you're talking about, but there were several men with white hair.

I need to know the names of- Bertram Cooper.

Yeah.

If you have all of the white haired characters, could you just run down the list of all of them and all their character names?

There was Roger Sterling.

Okay, sure.

He's the most famous white haired.

Silver Fox.

Bert Cooper.

The titular Sterling, there was Sterling Cooper.

So two white hairs running the show.

Two white hairs in one company.

Yeah.

Weird, right?

You think they would like battle it out.

Who can, who's the whitest of them all?

Do you think that you will remember these details about the show until the day you die?

Or do you think at some point they will just slip away from your brain?

I remember doing some thing, they had a trivia contest about the show and I did really well.

Because that doesn't happen a lot of times.

If you were to ask me any comedy bang bang trivia, I would not, in fact, I was looking at a script the other day for a sketch that I knew we wrote for the show and I was like, this is pretty funny.

Did we ever do it?

And I had to read, it was five pages.

On page four I said, oh, I remember filming this scene.

But I remember seeing you at some point talking about something over the course of the show, the TV show.

And you were like, oh yeah, that was the second season or whatever.

Oh yeah.

There are certain things that I know because they were like, we put them into certain episodes like season one, episode 10 was the green screen episode because it was the finale.

Like I know certain things about that, but I could not even tell you.

I'm kind of the same way with the Mad Men stuff.

Like I have a pretty good recall of most of the general beats of stuff.

There'll still be ones where I'm like, oh right, I forgot about that one.

Because they've rerun it kind of out of order on like the audience channel on DirecTV.

Interesting.

Why would they do it out of order?

I don't know.

Just because they don't, I mean, it's not like it's got a regular time slot or something.

So it kind of just pop in.

So just pop in and it's like, hey, if you like Mad Men, just watch one episode.

There was one on last night that I caught up like 10 minutes of because I was like, wow, I haven't seen that one in a long time, but it was from season one or two.

I can't remember two, I think the jet set one where he goes to Palm Springs and kind of, of course.

And I was like, I remembered shooting it because we shot in this beautiful mid-century house that apparently was owned by Frank Sinatra a long time ago.

In Palm Springs?

In Chatsworth, believe it or not.

I believe I may have been to that house.

It's a really beautiful, like classic mid-century.

Right, right.

And there was like a whole pool scene and all this stuff.

And I remember it being like a couple of really long days featuring, there was a big dinner scene outside and we're all shooting with all these like fancy guest stars and a giant, like tarantula, like crawled across somebody's foot.

Whoa.

And how did they know?

Were they looking at their foot?

They felt, they felt like a thing on their foot.

Look down.

Tarantula could be crawling across my foot right now.

And I would not know.

We have shoes on.

Well, yeah, they were barefoot.

They were barefoot.

This is the part of the story.

You buried the lead.

So here's how you tell the story.

You say, everyone's barefoot.

You know, Mad Men, someone was barefoot during one scene.

Right.

Okay.

And then you go backwards.

And then you go, you know, Mad Men is about tarantulas, right?

So anyway, when you're barefoot, you got to keep an eye out for him.

Anyway.

No, the place like freaked out.

Everybody literally like jumped on seats.

And then we had one guy on the crew who was like the weird bug guy who was like, oh, it's fine.

He randomly grabbed it, picked it up.

And he like, do you think it was one of these things where the actor could have gotten superpowers from this?

I would hope so.

That's what I would do if I were.

I would just be putting myself out there for spiders to bite me.

You know, I was a little bummed that in the spider verse, they didn't have a Don Draper Spider-Man.

That's so weird.

Isn't it strange?

Draperman.

Yeah.

Some established that Mad Men is about tarantulas.

Yes.

It's so, it's so weird that there were, you know, just, and you would have played it, right?

Absolutely.

I mean, you're not, you're not so high and mighty that you're like turning down calls to own supply.

Of course not.

By the way, did you bring your own supply?

I did.

And I I'll give it to you so you can get high.

Okay, great.

Thank you.

So I would, I love getting high.

You know that about me.

On someone else's supply.

Don, I mean, John, we're talking about Mad Men so much.

I just want to call you Don.

Cause that was your name.

Other than Dick, you had Don and Dick.

Born Dick Whitman.

Born Dick.

And these are spoiler alerts.

If you haven't seen the show, stop listening.

The main character has been to Korea.

Sorry.

I'm not going to say that, but yes, people go to Korea, not North Korea.

So get it right.

Yes.

The regular Korea, Korea prime.

When it Korea classic goes to Korea goes to Korea back.

Yeah.

Don Draper.

It's so crazy how that happens.

The old, we called it in the business.

We called the old switcheroo.

That's right.

I love, okay.

Anytime that I'm there in a, a script meeting, I'm always saying like, when are we doing the old switcheroo?

Time for a switcheroo.

You know, can't this character go to Korea and then come back someone else?

You know, it's it's it's it always works.

Yeah, exactly.

Because no one expects the old switcheroo.

No one expects the old switcheroo at any point.

No.

John, are you working on anything else now?

Or I mean, I know you can't talk about projects that are coming up, but give us a taste.

I can talk about whatever I want.

Yes.

I have agency.

This is what I'm talking about.

Like so many people come into this, this program and say, Oh, I can't talk about the thing that's like six minutes.

What are you doing?

Scott?

Let me just say I'm doing a little bit of everything.

Fuck.

Right.

Yeah, bro.

That's what I'm saying.

Like I got, I got my fingers in a lot of pies.

Oh shit.

Yeah, exactly.

What pies you got in there?

A little pie called Top Gun 2 much?

Top Gun 2!

Boom!

Flying around.

I'm on the highway.

To the...

You know where it goes.

It goes directly.

It's a highway.

First of all, no stopping.

No stop.

No stop lights.

Don't worry.

Yeah.

Also the quickest way to get breaking the speed limit on this highway.

No, because the highway goes to the danger zone, bro.

The danger zone.

Right to the DZ is, do you know, can you, let's break some news regarding this project here on the show is Kenny Loggins involved.

Is he doing a remake or a part two of his song highway to the danger zone?

Tell us.

I don't know.

Fuck!

But I'm going to say, because I can say whatever I want.

Absolutely.

Absolutely he is.

Will it go to number one as well?

What do you think?

I mean, it is number two, Top Gun 2, so it might go to number two.

Just to be cool.

It might go to two.

Depends.

Wow.

Okay.

And that is the end of the...

Finally.

That is the longest...

Might go to two.

Depends.

That is the longest ad we've ever done on this show, but I appreciate you coming by to help me out with it.

First of all, they are going to love it.

I know it's on spec.

Please, let's, anyone listening to this show, please...

Just wrap it up, send it over, tell them it's a 25 minute Depends ad.

Whatever millennial is in charge of the Depends Twitter account, they're going to want to hear about this.

John, I appreciate you coming by to help me celebrate and to help me read this ad.

It means the world to me.

You know, when you want somebody to read an ad, I'm your go-to guy.

You are, because I mean, you do it for those, uh, Mercurys.

What are they?

Mercedes Benz.

The best or nothing.

I'm going to choose nothing.

Well, that seems like an odd choice.

I cannot afford the best.

Yes, you can.

No, I can't.

You're a man of independent means.

Sure, but I can't afford a Mercedes Benz.

I guess I just get nothing there.

Here's the thing.

What do we have?

A ride around on a lime scooter?

You absolutely can't afford it.

What?

Yeah.

How's this financing?

Starting at 32,000, the GLA.

What?

The best.

But how's the fast?

What's the APR?

What's the...

Oh, you get like a 1.9 APR.

What?

Total cost $3,600.

$279 a month for 36 months with $2,600 due at signing.

But what would I, how would I write it off on my taxes?

The whole tax thing is very, very difficult for me.

You use it.

You drive here to come to work.

I know where you live.

You don't live here.

No, of course.

You drive here to come to work.

Sure.

Business expense.

But who would help me with these taxes?

I don't have a...

I got these two guys, Henry and Roger.

The Block Brothers.

Right.

I call them H&R.

Oh, okay.

They go deep into your finances and they'll get you some money back.

Wow.

So they go deep?

They go deep.

Depends.

So that is the, now that's the end of the ad.

Weird that there's another fake ending for it.

They had a couple fakies.

Very strange.

And you know what they did in the middle?

Switcheroo.

The old switcheroo.

John, thank you so much for being here.

Scott, it's my pleasure.

Thank you for having me.

Please come back in the next 10 years.

At least once.

I will promise you I'll be back at least once.

At least once and no more than two times.

Okay yeah.

Okay.

See you then.

Bye.

John Hamm.

My gosh, the matting man himself.

And I got to tell you, it's so good to see him.

He's one of our earliest guests, probably the most famous early guests that we had.

I mean, maybe Weird Al Yankovic.

Ben Stiller showed up for approximately 45 minutes in those early days, but wow.

So good to see him.

He's been such a big supporter of the show.

And uh- Oh no.

Oh yeah, right.

Oh no.

You're thrilled.

Thrilled?

I just left you at home.

You thought you did?

I hitched a ride under your car.

Oh wait.

No.

Indiana Jones style?

No, like that fakie monkey from Simpsons.

Okay.

I don't know.

I think our references are very off.

Who's on the side of the bus?

All right.

Somebody knows.

I'll take your word for it.

Take my word and throw it up your ass.

Take my word, please.

Take my word.

Cecil.

How do you know what Cecil is?

You're too young.

Because you talk about it in your sleep, begging for it to come back.

Okay.

This is my nephew, Todd, who lives with me.

Who lives with you.

He's been on the show several times previous to this.

What's several?

Four?

Something to that effect.

More like a million times.

Yeah.

I wouldn't say- I'm always here.

And if I'm not here, I'm in the twinkle in your eye.

Todd, look, I'm trying to do a show here.

I don't need interruptions like this.

Are you?

Yes.

All I see you doing is shuffling papers, pushing pens back and forth.

That's a lot of what I do on this show.

It's bullshit.

I see you writing questions down for your future guests.

What is your name?

Good start.

What is your name, by the way?

Todd, idiot!

Oh yeah, Todd.

That's right.

Todd is- Your very own sister named me.

Yeah, my sister.

This is my sister's boy who, long story, lives with me, made a wish on a- Long story, my parents abandoned me, you adopted me.

You won't- Didn't adopt you yet.

You won't say it's adoption yet, see?

Very informal adoption.

Happening, happening.

That's a step in the right direction.

You've never said yet.

So anyway, that's the long story.

Everybody ready?

Also, you made a wish on a wishing machine that made you an adult, a grown adult.

One time!

I wish to be big.

Most people don't even do it the one time.

Well, I'm special.

One time.

One time, one time.

And then you went back to now your normal age, which is- Middle school.

Middle school, and yet you still have a fully grown penis.

My penis stayed big and my body got little.

Do a wrap.

Wrap!

I'm not gonna wrap for you at the man.

I don't know what rhymes with little.

You only do wrap with an E at the end.

Oh, come on Todd.

Oh yeah, you hate wrap.

I forgot.

Look, you can't make jokes like that.

I can't?

In this era.

What era?

The Mr. Met-oo era.

The Met-oo era?

Yeah.

Never heard of it.

Yeah.

I'm not even allowed to see a hashtag.

You won't let me do anything.

You stay away from those hashtags, young man.

I've clicked a hashtag.

Which hashtag did you click?

One of your faves.

Which one?

Big bottom bitch.

That's not, I've never clicked.

I will see your explore.

Oh no.

Your explore page is all big asses.

We know what you like.

Okay, look, you know, I mean- Well, when you double click, that's what you get.

It starts to know what you like.

You know, it's an algorithm.

Oh, you know what an algorithm is?

Yeah, for my homework.

Are you doing your homework?

I haven't kept up with your studies.

I know you haven't, by the way.

And I did learn how to forge your signature so I could get out of all my detentions.

Are you going to school?

I don't, you know, Todd and I don't actually like make a lot of eye contact.

We keep very different hours.

I try to look you in the eye and your eyes will go anywhere else.

It's just, it's hard.

It's tough.

Cause you can't handle the real emotion of family.

You know, it's a lot for you.

Admit it.

I heard you begging and crying in your sleep.

Mommy, mommy, mommy.

Why are you listening to me when I sleep?

It's hard not to hear when I'm sharing a bed with you.

Well, that's true.

I don't want to see you admit it.

Put in some earplugs or something.

I can't put in earplugs cause my ears are closed up.

What do you mean they're closed up?

What's happening?

Do I need to take you to a doctor or something?

I semen too much.

Well you have a full grown adult penis.

I mean.

I sperm in my bed and I got the monkey ear.

Oh no.

What is the monkey ear?

Well you spank the monkey too much and your ears fill up.

Oh, okay.

Look.

Can't hear a word.

Is that what you're shouting?

Yeah.

Well, here's me whispering.

Here's me shouting.

You slightly elongated the vowels when you shouted.

That's about it.

Here's me whispering.

Todd, you have to stop doing that all the time, especially when I'm trying to sleep.

I don't care about your precious 15 hours.

Look I need my beauty sleep.

What's never going to happen?

You're only ever going to get a solid 15.

Well you gotta try.

I've gotten close.

I've gotten 14 and 58 seconds.

So now you think people should try to follow their dreams, huh?

You really think that.

You think you gotta try and see what happens.

Because whenever I have a dream, you're always telling me it's never going to happen, short stack.

I think my sister probably was pretty wise to follow her dream and abandon you.

Was that the extent of her dream?

No, she's got a much bigger dream that hasn't come true yet.

I don't even know what she's doing.

She just- You should call her.

She might want to know what I'm up to in school and stuff.

You could send her my new picture.

It's really not my responsibility to call her.

Send her my nude picture.

You do not have a nude picture.

Yes I do.

As far as I know.

Where did you just take a nude picture, young man?

On your digi cam.

My digi cam?

The one you got from Best Buy for all your secret nudes.

You said you didn't want the cloud to know?

Look please don't mess with my digi cam.

Those are my nudes.

And you have your printer in your bedroom for your digi cam.

You gotta print them out if you're gonna pass them out and send them to people.

See ya.

Okay everyone underneath me, my uncle Scott made all his nudes into business card sized photographs.

He cuts out with jagged edge scissors that make it look like a craft project.

They're not business card sized photographs.

They're more like school picture sized.

Okay fine, even more perverted.

And then you use those, what are they called?

Pinking shears to make the edges all jagged and cute.

And then you glue it to a piece of pink construction paper on the back you say for a good bit of time suck?

Well look you know I mean.

What?

You're trying to justify it?

Yeah.

You know I can't be sending them around on phones you know.

I mean that's how things get uploaded to the internet.

But don't, well here's what you don't know.

You gotta go to hashtag aukermannudes.

People have been taking pictures of the picture and putting it on insta.

No you're kidding me.

I swear to geez.

And this hashtag is trending?

Yeah it's not trending it's just a hashtag.

Trending poorly?

There's ten images.

It's not a trend.

There's no trend.

Look I want you to stay out of my private room okay?

It's you know I lock it for a reason.

I don't know how you're getting around the lock.

Well first of all the problem is you locked me in there.

Oh.

And you got all those dominatrix costumes made just your size and the label says just my size in it.

What's up with that?

What's up with what?

I mean just stay out of my room.

I don't need you in there looking at my hobby.

Why do you need a ball gag for when you're just playing online?

Okay look.

It enhances the experience alright?

This is sick.

I shouldn't be hearing this.

This is sick.

I don't know why you're talking about this stuff.

Just stay in our bedroom.

Our bedroom?

Finally I get some credit.

My bedroom that you.

I do clean it.

That you are there yeah and you do a very poor job of it young man.

Well I need more than one of those fake vacuums that just rolls back and forth with a little roller in it like a little kid uses.

You know what?

I'm gonna take some extra effort.

What you think I'm not strong enough?

I don't think you're strong enough.

What have you been doing?

I can do push ups and pull ups.

Okay do a push up right now.

Drop to the floor and give me 20.

Not 20 that's a lot.

Okay one.

Okay how about half?

You want to go down?

I want to go down and then lay.

No I think start down and go up.

Such a horrible guy.

Alright here watch.

Did it.

No you didn't.

Prove it!

This is a podcast.

For all they know I just did a hundred.

Why can't you be so nice it's to give me a little more credit.

You have not been working out.

Let me see those arms.

They made a noise as the muscle reversed itself instead of going up it went down and made a bew noise.

I know what I'm gonna do.

What's that?

I'm gonna get a birthday cake I'm gonna make a wish to get big big muscles as big as your head.

You remember what happened last time you made a big wish?

Yeah I got big results.

For life.

Not even needing a dick pill.

I don't even need a single dick pill.

Don't you want to enjoy your adolescence?

Not really I want to skip ahead.

Isn't it so much better to be a grown up don't you always love it?

Every night all you scream is I don't want to be a kid again.

What are my dreams like if I'm supposedly screaming all these various random things that have no tethered connection?

And when I say scream I mean scream not yell.

Wow.

What do our upstairs neighbors think?

I still can't believe you make me live in an apartment.

You know you got more money than that.

Yeah but I have a house that I don't want you around.

What?

I have a separate residence.

You have another house?

Yeah.

This is crazy.

On our 10 year anniversary you told me this?

That's where my man cave is.

What kind of reveal in our marriage?

This is not our 10 year anniversary.

This is my program's 10 year anniversary.

Why'd you give me that ring?

I did not give you a ring.

Yeah you did.

On the phone.

I did I called you on the phone to tell you to stay out of my office.

It's still a ring.

And I don't know why I keep all that stuff in the apartment instead of my man cave at home.

Probably because you got another relationship you're hiding and you're trying to keep stuff from her or him.

Have I told you about cool op yet?

Who op?

Who op did what?

Okay don't worry about her.

I'll get to the bottom of this.

We have a very fun time at the apartment.

At the Apollo.

To some that you're gonna say that.

Showtime at the Apollo is what you.

Well you always make me do show time at the Apollo and then bring out the cane.

Yeah I bring out the Sandman who sweeps you off the stage.

Look Todd.

Who is that guy?

He's my friend.

I think it's Horatio Sands.

Yeah the Sandsman.

That's what I said.

Oh I misheard you all these years.

Look Todd what are you gonna do with your life?

I don't know I guess my plans are to graduate middle school go to high school.

How many years is that by the way?

Well it should be three but I feel like I'm in a time loop.

Yeah I don't know what's going on with you I feel like you never get older.

I don't feel good.

I feel like ever since I made that big wish my body doesn't feel right and all my organs are spaced out.

And then you came back at the age you're at and maybe you're never gonna get bigger.

What if then you'd have me forever like your little personal Webster.

You'd be so glad.

Is that what they were doing with Webster they just wanted to keep him around until he was 80?

Probably.

Or I don't know what else but there are things like that where people keep him young.

Yeah.

Like a little pageant kid.

Yeah that's true but you're I mean you're decidedly not a pageant kid.

No but you did make me wear that flipper in my mouth.

That's true.

Look Todd you have to have goals you have to have a- Name your biggest goal.

My biggest goal I'm just trying to get through to the end of life I mean when you're- That's pathetic.

You're just trying to get through to the end of life?

I'm trying!

Yeah.

You know I mean when you're at the age I'm at and in 10 years doing a show you know you're at this point I'm just coasting.

Yeah so wait you started the show when you were 60 which means you were actually thinking gay.

No I'm not.

Some people would have been done at that age.

I'm not that old Todd.

You're not?

No how old do you think you really think I'm that old?

Well counting by the rings in your asshole you're 70.

Okay.

Todd you think you're so funny don't you?

Stop laughing at your own jokes.

I'm trying on new laugh.

I don't like it.

Have you tried it on any of your friends?

I don't have a single one to call my friend.

Well that's why you need to go to school.

Your dumb dog that you brought over.

Yeah the dog I brought over that one day.

Rocky.

I have some bad news about Rocky too.

Why what happened?

Don't worry about it.

I'm gonna worry.

Just you know I know I don't allow you to have a phone just don't check Instagram if you ever pick one up.

I do go on Instagram.com it's how I see all the hashtags.

You're logged in you know on the shared pad.

I am?

Oh no.

On the shared pad that we have.

No the pad is not meant to be shared.

It's my pad.

It's a shared pad.

I'm doing a lot of stuff on there.

Have you opened the photo booth?

No what is on there?

Check it out when you get a chance.

Why don't you open it right now?

All right.

Let me see.

Oh that was your muscle again.

I was doing a gym shot.

What is this?

The photo booth?

Oh what you don't like wiki feet?

Is that what that is?

I have a 10 out of 10.

They say I have beautiful tips.

Your tips look frosted.

Yeah that was frostbite.

That was when you kept me in the shower all weekend when the heat was out and you said I just sleep in the tub.

Well sorry.

I got frostbite on my my tips and all my whole wiki account went down.

So you're just uploading photos of your feet to wiki feet?

Yeah the people love it.

You know you I mean you know fetishes really intimately.

Do you know what fetishes are though?

Do you know what people are doing when they look at pictures of these feet?

I can take a wild guess.

Okay go ahead.

Picturing like sex in them?

Yes.

And picturing like sperm in them?

Yeah I mean that probably.

And picturing like picturing like semen on them?

You just yeah you said a synonym for the thing you said previously.

Wait what's the cinnamon for sperm?

Sperm and semen are the same thing.

The same cinnamon?

They don't taste like cinnamon if you haven't tasted it yet.

That's just yours and I'm not saying I've tasted it.

I'm just saying whenever you do that and go yuck.

And your own?

You shouldn't do that by the way.

It's not right to get high on your own supply.

Look Todd.

I know that's why I have to steal my drugs from our neighbor.

What drugs are you stealing?

Come on man open your peeps.

Are you high right now?

Yeah I'm stone as a bone.

I don't even care anymore.

I just got baked in the middle of this conversation and didn't even notice.

It's been ten years we've been together.

Todd you have to stop doing drugs.

You have to go back to school.

You have to get your life together.

Then I have one humble request.

Alright Todd what is it?

Live from New York it's Saturday night.

Okay that's not this show.

You don't get to say that.

What?

Look Todd go back home okay?

I don't know what hour we are in this show but I'll be I'll wrap up soon and I'll come back.

Fine wrap up soon and on that note live from LA it's Comedy Bank Bank!

Alright thank you Todd see you later.

Oh Todd.

Oh I hate when he shows up.

I hate him.

God I wish he would never come back but that's the price of having an open door policy is sometimes people like that will show up and speaking of open doors this door is closed right now but perhaps it'll open in a second and uh.

Oh I know that sound.

Look out loser!

Hey it's Power Wheels Beth how are you?

Pew pew pew better than you always.

I don't know if that's true it's my 10th anniversary I'm so excited.

Oh man I can't wait till I'm 10.

Oh yeah how old are you?

I'm 8.

By the way for those of you who have never heard Power Wheels Beth you work you work upstairs here.

My mom works upstairs in marketing and uh well I ride around on this Power Wheels.

All day every single day.

That's right.

And occasionally she do you I've never uh got it clear with you do you go down the elevator in the Power Wheels or down the stairs?

Well I used to go in the elevator but now that I'm 8 I go down the stairs like a real rebel!

Yeah how do you get back up?

Do you have enough pow pow pow?

No then I take the elevator back up.

Oh okay right.

And I have to be like can you hold that door I have to zoom my little pew pew pew.

You're in a tiny I guess tiny is uh you know tinier than a real car but uh.

Red Jeep.

Red I thought you said Reggie.

I was just like is Reggie here?

Is he here?

Red Jeep yeah it's a tiny red Jeep yes of course.

And you did you just turn 8?

Yeah turned 8 recently.

Congratulate when is your birthday?

Um March 3rd.

March 3rd!

A great date.

Yeah I was like my mom said that she was hoping oh please don't be born on the Ides of March that was her only request and I came early.

So 12 days early?

Yeah.

Great.

Um so what's been going on with you Power Wheels Beth?

I mean it's our 10th anniversary I don't know if you knew that or if you just wandered down but we've been doing this show for 10 years now.

That's so cr- you're this show is older than me?

Older than you if you can believe it yeah.

I can't and I won't?

Older than even the day your parents did it.

What do you- To conceive you.

Scott tell me what you're talking about right now.

That was 8 years and 9 months ago I believe or 10 months ago by now.

What are you talking about?

Oh so your parents haven't- okay I guess it's up to me to have the talk with you.

I choose you Andy Richter good bye!

Wait uh- Choose you to leave!

Who is it?

Oh yeah Dash Grabham!

Hello Scott!

Dash Grabham the Pokemon trainer.

That's right I get Pokemon and I capture them and I subjugate them and I train them for battle but not Andy Richter he is gone forever for me now.

And you let Andy go?

Last time Dash was on the show he captured Andy Richter into his uh uh Pokemon what do you call it?

Pokeballs!

Your Pokeball yes.

There are many kinds.

Great balls, Ultra balls, Master balls.

Well that's punk as hell!

Oh.

That might be punker than me!

What?

I don't know if you know Power Wheels Beth here did you ever meet I can't recall if you've ever been on the same show.

Nope.

Okay that's something that I heard someone say once in France when I was capturing a Mr. Mime.

Well speaking of France I was just about to have the sex talk with Beth here uh.

Oh hell yeah I could do it for you if you want.

Oh yeah please do.

Okay.

This is a good way for me to learn I'm convinced!

For sure so when two Pokemon love each other very much.

Okay.

They battle and one beats the other one into the dirt until it's in submission and then that Pokemon becomes stronger and grows and then lays an egg and then you leave that egg with a stranger for like 12 months and then it's a baby!

That sounds like how I'd be brought into this world.

Thanks what's your name again?

Dash I'm Dash Grabham I'm gonna be a Pokemon master!

Oh.

Dash is from the Kanto region?

That's right.

Uh where there are no restaurants?

Not a lot.

Just a lot of inns?

There's one big Italian restaurant.

No one goes in to eat.

No it's not for eating it's for crime mostly.

That sounds like mostly what you need a restaurant for.

Hell yeah that's a sweet ride.

Thanks.

I wonder if you combined uh the the power wheels car with your Pokeball boy that would be an exciting kind of situation.

Yeah can you evolve my jeep into a big jeep when I'm 16 in a thousand years?

Whoa that sounds like a really good idea.

We have to get your jeep to battle first.

How does a jeep battle?

Well my I saw someone on the street who said something that was called vehicular manslaughter.

Oh.

Wait you saw something on the street?

Yeah.

You saw a vehicular manslaughter?

I'll recount the event for you.

There was a police officer on a motorcycle.

Another man driving a car I did not catch his face ran into a man crossing the street then the man rode away and the police officer shouted that thing I've seen is vehicular manslaughter.

So you witnessed someone witnessing vehicular manslaughter?

What did you say?

Yes that.

Okay so yeah.

I think that's how a jeep gets experience in battle.

Oh wow Scott can I vehicular manslaughter you in my jeep right now?

Oh I don't you know I don't think so I think I think we want the show to go on a little longer than 10 years although this could be the final episode.

Winner the jeep.

Now you have to give her a badge Scott.

Wait a minute how did she?

She defeated you in battle with her jeep.

All she did was circle around me.

It was super effective Scott give her a badge.

I don't have a I don't necessarily have a badge.

Make up a badge for me Scott.

I want to be in Girl Scouts for the cookies but my mom says no.

Why won't your mom let you be in Girl Scouts?

No one will take me to after school.

Well your mom works a lot is she a single mother I can't recall.

We tried to solve the mystery of my dad once but it didn't go very far.

Well look I can make a badge with just I guess I have some paper here if you have some scissors as well and a little bit of gold glitter and some glue and this is very crafty.

Scott this is very good.

I also have some a little bit of quick dry paint.

Wait Scott you know I think you're a vomit garbage man but that is very good.

Whoa look at it.

Here this is just a little something I made.

Whoa you defeated the gym leader of the comedy bang bang gym.

Did I?

Oh that's what this badge is.

That's what this badge signifies.

Yeah this is beautiful.

It's like three dimensional.

It has like a dragon head.

Great job.

Thank you so much.

It's like origami covered in glitter paint.

And if by the way if you ever leave the building I'm going to have to ask for your badge and if you have a gun as well.

Oh huh.

I don't have a gun.

Okay good.

That's good to know.

Do you have a gun?

I wish I had a gun Scott.

You don't even.

My weapon of choice is Pokemon.

Yeah you don't even battle anyone yourself.

You let these Pokemon do the battles for you.

Well well well well well well no.

That's wrong.

Have you ever actually physically assaulted anyone?

Yes.

A man who told me to stop sleeping under the bridge.

I threw a Pokeball at his face and then the Pokemon fought him for me.

No you didn't do it.

I threw the Pokeball Scott.

Does the man who pushes the button to drop the bombs over the foreign country has he not committed murder?

Is that just the is that the bomb the bomb did a murder Scott?

Some would say his superior officers are more responsible or the government itself.

Well I'm I am both the man and the superior officer and the government in this scenario.

Can I battle you right now in this jeep?

Oh heck yeah but I will warn you I have Pokemon that are strong against jeep type Pokemon.

Okay I don't know I've evolved to beat the leader of the comedy bang bang comedy gym.

That's true.

Okay what type of jeep type Pokemon do you have in that ball?

I mean I don't have any jeep type Pokemon.

Were you just bluffing?

This is the first jeep type Pokemon I've ever seen.

I assume it's an electric type so I should use a rock type.

Maybe you just hold on hold on freeze these no gozies yet.

Maybe you freeze these no gozies for how long I'm giving you 10 seconds 10 seconds that's all I need is there a water based Pokemon maybe for the electricity that'd be bad against electricity electricity strong against water I need a rock type Pokemon.

I thought that like your water would short out the electricity.

No what conducts it out.

Geo dude I choose you.

Dude dude Geo dude.

Okay this guy's just saying his name.

Geo dude.

Okay oh I like him.

Yeah yeah yeah dude yeah dude.

It's an epic battle Scott.

Okay so Geo dude is basically standing still and just saying his name.

Meanwhile Beth is there now petting petting geos now giving him a noogies.

Oh wait hold on he put on a jacket.

Hold on he's going over to the jukebox.

Hey dude dude Geo dude.

He's hitting the jukebox now trying to get a song to play.

Now they're just dancing.

Beth is dancing in her actual.

Do it and she's but she's pointing her fingers up and doing that kind of dancing when you don't know how to dance and you're just pointing at the heavens and alternating fingers.

That's a good dance.

I like this Geo dude.

Now they're friends I guess.

He does that a lot.

Is it a tie what happens?

I mean me and Geo dude are gonna get our mom to go make us Italian sodas.

That's really just soda water that you put some flavoring in.

I know Scott but I like seeing how the sausage is made.

Like I'm so happy I know how I was made two pokemons fell in love.

They battled one into the ground into the dust and then a Beth was born.

That's truly how your bread was made.

So what do you do in this situation?

They're just gonna go off together and you let them go?

I mean not usually I would recall the Pokemon but my sort of MO is that whatever Pokemon I have I just sort of throw to the wind whenever someone else wants them or whenever I can't remember which ones I have.

So this guy is like my little buddy now?

Hey man you take that Geo dude and you take care of him.

He's never had a mom before.

Oh wow you're a mom now.

Babies having babies.

Not you I thought you said you were gonna go get our mom to make us Italian sodas.

Oh I'm sorry I assumed Geo dude had a mom and like our moms would be friends.

He fully does not.

I'm fully I'm trying to set my mom up over more friends her own age.

Oh yeah?

Yeah I feel like she's at where she does marketing she like only has coworkers who are older or younger than her.

How old is she?

My mom.

Yeah.

I can't be friends with her I'm only 12 Scott.

You're double-didge lucky.

Heck yeah when I crossed that threshold I was like whoa bam there's another guy here and it's another numb.

Yeah I know this guy over here he's this show is 10 this show is full two hands.

What?

Oh no man I'm older than this show.

I know you have you can't even do it on your hands.

I'm gonna be so sad when I can't do it on my hands anymore because I'll never be able to do it ever again but also happy that I'm double-didge.

I lost that privilege when I turned nine.

What are you missing a finger?

I'm missing two fingers.

Oh that's right you only have four on each hand.

So when you were my age that was when you were full hands?

That's right.

Oh that's tough.

Wow well I'm glad you guys you guys seem to be friends I mean you're so close in age although.

Everyone on your show is usually so old Scott.

It's honestly nice to be around someone who's like vaguely in the same age.

I mean you were on first I think with Jon Hamm who's like you know he must seem like a grandpa to you.

Oh god.

Well guys this is great you've made friends and I feel like this show was responsible for it.

Yeah thanks for giving me this geo dude Dash and Scott hey great job on double-didge.

No problem.

Your show's full hands and no one can ever take that away from you.

Instead they cut your show's hands fingers off.

You watch them.

You protect them Scott.

You watch your show's hands.

You watch it.

Okay all right all right guys I don't know exactly why you're so upset about this.

Just worried.

It's just once you lose them you can't get them back.

I have asked and tried.

Are you guys going off together or what are you gonna do Dash?

I'm not sure.

I'm not supposed to be under the bridge anymore.

Yeah your Pokemon is going off with her.

You can have an Italian soda with me and my mom if you want.

I choose you peach soda if they have that flavor.

We do.

Hell yeah.

That's great.

All right guys thank you so much for dropping by.

Really appreciate it.

Okay.

Oh wow.

Power Wheels Beth and Dash grab them.

Just grab them I barely have any idea what he's talking about.

Anytime he's talking.

Speaking of talking is there.

I'm hearing a little feedback in this in this microphone.

I wonder if maybe engineer Devin if there's something that.

Sound speeds.

Wait a minute.

I know those two words sound speeds.

Let's roll it boys.

It's our current intern.

This is Gino.

Hello.

Yeah hi what's going on Scott.

Yeah.

I got a report that you're you need someone to like press I forget it was press record press pause.

We've been doing this show for a long time at this point.

But I just I you know the the light went up you know like hey interns Scott needs a hand.

The intern Gino signal is that what you mean?

Yeah yeah it's weird it's just an Italian sub that they shine up in the air.

Gino is our intern he's been working on the show for now at least half a decade decade.

Yeah it's been over it's been since my second or third year at NASA and I'm in year nine at NASA.

You don't seem to be graduating.

I'm in no rush though you know everyone tells you that college is the best time of your life.

So why would you want it to end of course.

Also I meet all these like real people that work here like you and shit and doesn't seem that great.

How many units do you get for working on this show?

And I got one unit like a year ago.

At least put it away by the way.

No I see okay you mean like credits.

You're Canadian so it makes sense.

Yeah no I get three credits per year that I do but then they realize I only do like three to four episodes a year or whatever.

So it's it's working out good for me.

By the way you should be doing every single week but you're commuting from Long Island.

It's very difficult I know and you know it's until they build an airport that goes directly from New York to Hollywood California.

Long Island to Hollywood California.

I'm fucked I'm on the railroad to fucking Jamaica transferring there for the air train.

What are those stops by the way?

Going back out?

Well if I jump on a Babylon which is the end of it.

Oh wow saying them backwards is interesting.

Are you drunk right now?

No but I took like 24 Zenedrine this morning.

Why so many?

I just wasn't you know I needed a little wake me up and I had a couple of cold brews and then I just went through you know they they banned Zenedrine a few years ago but I have like a palette of it for my buddy who works at GNC.

Do you know do you know my buddy Tall Ronnie?

I don't know Tall Ronnie he works at GNC the one here in town or the one in Long Island?

He works at the one at Roosevelt Field Mall.

No of course I don't know him.

How would I know?

I usually pop in there grab some bourbon chicken and some creatine and get out of there.

The bourbon chicken is not for sale at GNC it's at for food court.

Okay yeah wouldn't that be weird if like suddenly you went to GNC and they gave you the chicken and vice versa.

Oh I mean chicken is a protein.

That's true that's a good point.

Hey it's nature's protein.

I wonder what's in that protein powder I've never quite figured it out.

Whey isolate which is some sort of derivative of milk.

Whey isolate.

I thought you were telling me to isolate something like isolate.

Isol is now a verb.

Brother you need to isolate man before you do and that's the organization that I joined when I was.

No you didn't.

Yeah no I did I signed up for isole now I give them like x amount of dollars a month.

No do you know what isole is?

I'm not sure but I get to feed what looks like an adult man with a beard.

For the climbing on monkey bars?

Yeah for the cost of a cup of coffee a month I can keep this guy fed.

Oh no Gino you don't want to be doing that.

And I don't know what AK-47 stands for but I just I got him I started a Kickstarter to get him one.

Yeah well let's catch up after the show.

Okay yeah I miss you man.

I miss you too it's so great that you drop by to I mean presumably you know it's our 10th anniversary of the show.

Uh yeah no I definitely knew that.

You didn't Gino you're our intern this is one of your main responsibilities we've been planning this show for months and months.

I can't keep track all this I'm still trying to- You've been at the meetings!

Okay I've been at the meetings but to be fair I have been reading a lot.

Before or during or after the meetings?

During the meetings I find myself reading a lot.

What are you reading?

These assorted books and magazines.

You don't need to say assorted books we know that books come in an assortment.

I've been reading well because I used to read the same book over and over and over again.

Which book was that?

It was the William Friedkin memoir.

The William Friedkin memoir?

To me I frequently write that was the issue.

So I called it the frequent Friedkin.

Because I was trying to have my own- You're a Friedkin flyer as I recall.

I was trying to have my own uh what are these uh what's it called?

Memoir, diary, book.

Where you talk on microphone and you record it.

Podcast!

You work here!

Yes that's what I was trying to do I was trying to have a podcast called the frequent Friedkin where I talked about the Friedkin's memoirs.

The frequent Friedkin?

Yes the Friedkin.

Welcome to the Friedkin.

Like this is how let me do the introduction for my Friedkin.

So it was welcome to the- because it came out on Friday night Thursday at midnight which is technically Friday.

So I say it's the freakend time for the frequent freakin' frequent Friedkin.

It's the freakin' weekend baby.

It's time- He's cancelled by the way.

Is he?

Yeah R Kelly?

Oh no.

Oh I thought you were talking about freakin'.

Oh no no.

I haven't even pitched it to fuckin' Hal and now it's already cancelled.

Yeah Hal's gone sorry.

Hal's gone?

What happened?

Did he open the pod bay doors?

Well uh look you're supposed to be here.

I don't want you reading during our meetings.

We've been planning this show for a long time.

Sorry I'm just tired.

What are you reading now?

You've been doing assorted books?

Yeah I switched books up big time which has been nice.

Big time meaning you went to a different one.

Yes yes and I'm reading the novelization of scenes from Italian restaurant.

I knew they made novelizations for movies.

I didn't know they did them for songs.

I didn't know that either.

But it's a rich extended universe.

Oh it's huge yeah.

You got all kinds of- and they kind of pull from other stuff you know what I mean?

There's a whole chapter that takes place in Mr. Cacciatore's across from the medical center.

Is there an anthropomorphic bottle of red, an anthropomorphic bottle of white?

Yes yes and it's weird because they like- Is one sad when one isn't chosen?

Right well they're sort of like the devil and angel on the main character whose name is BJ.

I'm pretty sure we know who that's supposed to be.

He has a bottle of red on one soldier and a bottle of white on the other.

And then there's- and this is the fucked up part because you know you think songs are a lot of like imagery and similes and metaphors and whatnot.

And if they correspond to the music it can make you feel the same you know a certain way.

Right but then when you read it as a novelization you're like oh there's more literal stuff.

The book opens with a guy fucking a gin and tonic.

What?

But he's calling it a tonic and gin.

Tonic and gin?

This is I mean- He's straight up cumming in it and he's like- Wow.

It's insane and that's what- it just caught me.

It just hooked me.

Yeah well that's a great opening scene.

I wish there was a way that you could listen to books.

You work in the audio medium.

I don't know why you don't know this but yes there are- Actually I'm in audio small now I was told.

The mediums are baggy.

You're very tiny.

You seem to be losing weight.

I think it's too much zenadrin to be honest.

I'm running a constant body temperature of 106.7.

We play the greatest old days.

You seem to have lost about three pounds since you've sat down.

Yeah I'm vibrating.

I truly am.

My teeth are rattling.

It's easy like how much does a tooth weigh?

An ounce?

You lose four from lack of nutrition?

Sure.

Dropping LBs baby.

Quarter of a pound.

Yeah.

The original quarter pound there was four teeth that fell out of a skinny person's head.

And McDonald's is like this is a good idea.

We can weigh it against a burger.

They put it like a blind lady came out with a blindfold and she had these two scales and they put a quarter pound of burger on one and then four human teeth on the other.

And they were like it's even.

And then it was like- This sounds like- This industry is out of order.

This sounds like an ancient caveman trial.

Oh now that's a good idea for a book.

Ancient caveman trial?

Ancient caveman trial.

Well I think ancient caveman you sort of hat on hat at that point.

We know.

That's true.

Yeah we know.

Yeah exactly.

Well cause you just want to make sure you're not cause like caveman lawyer that's a fun movie.

Those are two different things.

You're wearing a hat on a hat right now by the way.

What is going on here?

Because my body temp is so high I'm- You're trying to trap it in there?

I'm trying to trap it cause I'm blowing legit steam out the top of my head.

Right yeah.

I'm a football player sitting on the sideline in like December or whatever in Buffalo.

Great wings by the way.

Buffalo Wild Wings?

No the episode of Wings that's playing behind your head.

Oh yeah sorry.

It's a great wing.

I keep the TV on to sort of occupy me while I do the show.

That makes sense totally.

But Geno- How have you been?

I'm talking about- Don't worry about me.

Is this the 10th anniversary thing now?

Yes we're doing the 10th anniversary right now.

Thank God you made it.

Then let's roll sound.

We have been recording the entire time and this is not your job anymore.

What is my job then?

I don't even- first of all you're supposed to get waters.

There's water right in front of- Oh thanks for the reminder.

I'm fucking dehydrated.

Holy shit.

No I need some water.

Oh alright yeah we can get waters for everybody.

Yeah free.

Kevin can we get some waters in here for everybody?

No this is your job.

Oh okay my bad.

You're supposed to be doing it.

I thought Kevin was an intern's intern but it turns out the kids are producing now.

I don't know what he does here.

You part of yours- what about one for me?

One for you?

One for me, one for you, and one for the Holy Ghost.

One for me, one for them.

This one's for the studio, aka Occaman, and the other one's my Irishman.

Alright thank you for that.

I am gonna take a sip here.

Where have you been since- I mean I don't think I've seen you since December, maybe the Ace Hotel show that we did?

Oh yeah I did that one.

That was fun flying in here and doing- I didn't know you guys could do this in front of other people because it makes no sense to me to buy a ticket to see people talk on microphone when you can listen to it in your apartment with your cock in your head.

You're blowing up our entire business model here.

You don't want to be doing that?

No?

Okay I'll drop it off.

Okay.

Your entire business model is based on the PCAS blast?

Yeah exactly.

We did not have a good year.

Let's go back to the drawing board.

By the way you brought some drawings I noticed here.

Oh yeah.

Speaking of the drawing board, what are all these?

This is what I'm calling American hentai.

I've never seen bodies in those positions before.

These are some classic Kama Sutrik positions that I drew.

See this is me blowing millhouse.

So I call this American hentai.

Very good, very nice.

I'm thinking about doing like a weekly show where you record you and some friends talking about it and then you like put it up for people to listen to.

These are podcasts.

You keep describing podcasts.

Well whatever they're called.

I'm sorry I can't remember the name.

I employ you.

It's the same shit as- I mean in the form of credits and exposure.

Hey exposure man I'll tell you what.

I could use a little exposure at 106.7.

Well take off your two hats.

Well if I take off my first one then the second one will inflate.

I have like a tinfoil jiffy pop thing underneath the Rasta hat.

Were you trying to keep people from reading your thoughts or something?

Well I was on a plane one time and a kid hit me with a pencil and it got stuck in the top of my skull for the entire ride and I didn't know about that.

And when I got off the plane I hit it because I'm a little tall.

Not fat but tall.

And I hit my head and the pencil went in another inch deeper.

Just brutal.

So now I always wrap my head in tinfoil before I jump on a flight.

It's hell at the gate.

I don't know how you get through the sensors.

I'm like let me go through again.

They're like do you have a bracelet on or something?

I'm like I don't know what it could be.

I just keep going through the metal.

Did they take off your Rasta hat?

And then eventually they're like sir I think you gotta take off the Rasta hat.

And I'm like that's for religion.

Oh they can't do anything.

They can't say shit.

So then they scan my head with the little wand and it's beeping and stuff and I say I already had my brain replaced with a Pentium processor so that's why.

Okay do you have some sort of friendly doctor who gave you a card regarding that?

My doctor Andre 3000 the Seal is his name.

The Seal?

Wait he's a Navy Seal?

No no no.

He calls because he says he's named Andre 3000.

Everyone goes like the guy from OutKast and he goes no like the Seal.

From Andre the Seal.

I don't know Andre the Seal I guess.

I'm pretty sure it was a Disney movie from someone's childhood.

Maybe someone older than me's childhood.

But I don't remember.

So he's correcting people.

He hooks me up.

He's gonna be a weed prescription, a DMT vape pen and he gets me green tea extract and guarana and all the other like foundational ingredients.

Guarana is that lizard poop?

What is that?

Yes that's iguana guarana is what you're thinking of.

And it's not the 80s band iguana guarana.

This is guarana is an accelerant a human accelerant that is found in assorted gecko and Nile monitor and other kind of.

Komodo dragons guess what don't have it.

They don't have it.

That's the thing man a lot of people assume Komodo dragons have guarana in their poop but that's like the main thing I'm constantly telling people.

Yeah I know.

That's the thing that's always coming up.

It's come up during several of our meetings by the way.

I know well that's me.

You put the book down finally.

I'm like alright the Friedkin connection let me pause for a second here I can't wait to hear about him slapping a woman on the set of Exorcist but for now.

Which woman?

Ellen Barkin.

Oh really?

Yes.

Wait Ellen Barkin or Ellen Burstyn?

Ellen Barkin was there?

Ellen Burstyn was there but he smacked her because she had been barking.

Oh okay.

And they were trying to get room tone and they were like let's get room tone and Ellen was like.

She might have actually been possessed.

Yeah and she's barking up a fucking storm chewing on a bone so Freakin has to go over there and go do you love me do you trust me?

Bat and slaps her right in the face and Ellen Barkin becomes Ellen Burstyn because the blood vessels in her face be bursting.

What an incredible Hollywood story.

Hey it's not mine it's the Friedkin Memelas.

Well you know it so well because you've read it so many times.

It's the only book I have possession of.

There's two books that have possession of me though.

Oh really?

Okay.

The Bible and the Torah.

Of course those are great books.

Two of my favorites.

Best Sellers.

I only read Best Sellers.

Has there ever been a year?

William, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, the usual.

Has there ever been a year where the Bible dropped down low on the list and people are like we need to buy more Bibles?

Yeah that was the year Sorcerer's Stone came out.

Okay right.

I'll tell you what George R.R. Martin if he ever fucking finishes a book he's gonna be popping off.

Fuck the Bible.

He'll be more popular than the Bible there.

Finally.

Yes.

Oh yeah more twins fucking in the Bible though.

That's true yeah.

Because Cain and Abel 69 I don't know I only read a novelization of the Bible.

You read a novelization?

I read the Cliff's notes.

Oh how is Cliff?

He's good he's good he moved out of Boston.

Is he still mad about losing Jeopardy?

Him and Weird Al.

Oh right yeah.

Yeah he lost on Jeopardy.

Two of my favorites.

Yeah he might be on the show.

Uh yeah can you see into the booth from here?

No I can't.

Yeah then I'll be there.

Okay don't worry about it.

Okay.

What they don't tell these fucking engineer guys is that you could just put a fucking little weight on the record button and the shit just records.

You don't have to hold down the record button the entire time have you been doing that every time you've done the show?

Wait what are you talking about?

You press it once you depress it and it records the entire time until you press it again.

Are you fucking kidding me?

Yeah you've been bad guy I wondered why one finger is huge on your right hand.

Yeah well that's from uh you know the male g-spot is real um so.

You've said that many times that's the other thing you say when you put down the book.

Well because it's uh it's constantly coming up in the earwolf you know Colin Anderson's like the male g-spot's not real and I'm like boom freaking memoirs.

I don't know why he's coming out swinging it's the UK and I'm like hey are you okay UK?

Because the male g-spot is fucking real watch and then I do like you know the whole demonstration.

So it's a combination of pressing the button and sticking your finger up your butt.

Oh I call it pressing the button.

Right.

Oh and the record button yes that's the one.

You're pressing wait you're not pressing the record button with the finger that you've kept up your ass have you?

No I have a little cup of water I dip it into like in beer pong.

I wondered why the control room smells like shit.

Does it?

Yes.

Okay okay.

And yours in particular.

Yeah well I I'm starting to think it might be my fault they make those uh rubber gloves you know so I'm gonna.

Yes I know they make rubber gloves.

I'm gonna buy rubber gloves cut all the fingers off and that's five for every one I purchase and then I could use that as like a little fingy condom.

Don't do a dickens with the.

Is that called the dickens?

That's called the dickens that's called the yeah everyone in dickens novels has the gloves with their fingers cut off.

first episode of the show ever let's talk to this person first you know him from MTV's human giant he played the bad guy I think in the film I love you man yeah I mean he was a bad guy he played a man with a different point of view from the protagonist I guess okay okay you played the tan guy pardon me and you can see him on the upcoming medical police on Netflix is that correct yeah playing another bad guy another tan guy pretty pale okay pretty pale in this one welcome Rob Hubel hello thank you thank you for having me Scott Aukerman this is um this is yeah this is exciting this is so exciting yeah I just want to get a little bit straight about what the show is about it's a 10-year anniversary but yeah but is the show gonna be funny or do we just talk about stuff that's funny oh no no yeah we the show is just deadly deadly dry and so we just explain why we explain why something is funny we're gonna deconstruct that's all it is that's all that's all we're gonna do don't worry about it okay look I mentioned you're a part of human giant right you're one-third of human giant yeah yeah or you're one-fifth I don't even know how you guys divvy it up yeah does Aziz get more on this or does yeah yeah Aziz gets more it's done by height so yeah so I'm four-thirds that's as many yeah no we do the show and it's uh yeah are you still gonna are you ever gonna do the show again is that the number one question that you get yeah people keep asking us that um I think we probably will do some more stuff right now we're all just kind of doing different things like um yeah sure that's what happened to bands all the time I mean they do different things yeah yeah we have solo projects they always get back together yeah we're all doing solo projects and then we're all gonna get addicted to heroin probably well how is that going well it's going you know what it's uh it's way easier to get addicted to heroin than I thought really yeah yeah because see I didn't know about it but what I what I didn't anticipate is that heroin is really fun it is so fun it's like super super fun if you're out there and you have not tried heroin by the way if there's one message that Robin I don't know if we can no I mean pick it up I mean I don't know if we should actually be telling people that look here here's the thing I don't know if we should be spreading the word about heroin because I think people probably heard about it by now all right well I I want to turn to our next guest he he also was on the very first show that we ever did he's here from Reno 9-11 hey uh Scott yeah real quick timeout we try not to say 9-11 when we say the name of the show oh that's it really yeah okay yeah why is that uh yeah yeah why don't you call it Reno 9-11 Rob we try not to invoke the worst history basically in the history of the United States okay yeah I don't know maybe Pearl Tarbird death count was that higher how about Reno I don't think so what if it's like Reno September 11th no I you know what I I Rob just did exactly what we're trying not to do right yeah actually you weirdly made it worse yeah I see where you're going I see what it is so let's try not to invoke Osama 9-11 wait what did I just say hang on a second Reno 9-11 in no way related to the greatest American tragedy that ever happened when you created the show did you actually maybe think of calling it Reno Pearl Harbor or no we did but we felt like that one was a little bit you know like kind of from grandma's attic it's confusing yeah exactly that one was a tragedy was a little tragedy plus time a little too old time to hold time sorry have we even finished the introduction have we even said that his name is Tom no it's Tom Lennon my two my two guests from my first show hello guys thank you so much for returning thank you so much sometimes I feel like we come on the show and I just feel like we're rehashing things we've said before no I don't think so I think this is a brand new conversation that we never very weird take on stuff anytime we get together of course we gotta talk about old things but it's all about the new stuff there's a ton of joie de vivre but we're not gonna go over stuff that we went over never never long time no I feel like whenever we get together we talk about something that's new the three of us we get together we talk about doing exciting things I love talking about Reno 9-11 I never stop talking about it guys thank you so much it means the world to me that you would drop by I mean 10 years ago 10 years ago do you remember that day I was 17 I was 17 years old you're now an old old looking 27 thank you you had that feathered hair and you had a playboy earring I remember yeah you came in a trans am and you came in a trans am yep and I was full of full of young dumb and full of cum where did you get your cum I'm still full of cum I'm so filled with cum you gotta release some of that I saw you at the whiskey that night trying to get rid of some of it yeah yeah yeah and I remember I left after the first 40 minutes I was like I don't think he's gonna cum no wait so you're trying to get rid of it through your penis just open your mouth and spit it out oh that's a good idea guys do you do you literally remember that day I remember it very vividly but for you it was probably just a blip in your show business career I remember thinking that you ruined the name of the live show because we've been doing the live show doing the live show at UCB and I yeah I exported it over to the podcast you thought that was a brand breaker I thought it was a brand breaker I thought you ruined the name I still think you ruined the name I'd be surprised if we literally did ruin the name yeah so if this catch is on good luck but for the first episode of this I remember it very vividly because I was nervous and you guys were very nice to drop by and and and do this for me and I also remember burning the episode on a CD and listening to it later going was I okay did I do a good job and what did you think I didn't think you were that great yeah not good not good I mean it filled an hour you called to me a little ethnic which ethnicity I don't know I don't know but whichever one it is it's too much right it's just I wish we could go a little less I think with the host I claw and scrape to everything I get and I'm never anything but really bummed about my career pretty much every day well I mean so that makes two of us in you know I'm bummed about your career thank you very much Ian I love you man I auditioned for Rob's part oh you did all I ever wanted was to play that guy who had and look where it got me who had a bigger part doing this podcast see Rob had a more memorable part I think I but I wrote I only remember you in it I barely remember Robin it yeah you have a great you have some great stuff in that movie the short version is that everyone's unhappy on the end everyone is unhappy on the inside Hollywood in Hollywood but not while they're listening to this podcast because you have brought great joy I mean I don't think this ever would have happened without your support Tom I remember you were very kind to me afterwards and said I believe there was an email where you said I killed now I'm hearing that you apparently didn't feel that way but you're a good liar I just thought you were very very ethnic but without you guys agreeing to do that first episode and honestly your star power that you brought to the big star power what about our don't like our financial contributions finance I mean you sent me your taxes before I before I booked you on the show and I took a look at those thank you and why did you have to check our tax returns you know of course you know appearing on the show is a tax deductible act and so and we have a lot of conflicts that's right yes yeah you have a lot of conflicts not only with just timing oh yeah you have conflicts with a lot of performers who were on the show I'm in some fights I'm in some fights with a lot of kid comics I've been following a lot of kids really a lot of the up-and-comers you do like videos no no like little kids like YouTube comedians yeah like five and six year old stand-ups and stuff they know that if they cross us we'll murder them yeah and like I've been to like a lot of little strong you know do you know Tyson Bradford oh yeah really funny he's really funny he's really good he's like seven he's about seven years old yeah and so you you have a feud with Tyson I yes because I think that I just don't think he's funny does you do know does he know that the human giant family is protected by the state family which is a subdivision of the UCB family exactly yeah the state family and the mr. show family very very different families heads of the five comedy families not a lot of overlap not a lot of overlap and sometimes there's a Bob yeah Bob has a little bit of overlap where what what overlap does he have Bob directed a Bob Rockwell's ever and then grant movie oh you were going to prison yes ended up being called let's go to let's go to prison yes so there's a little bit of and there's little overlap there's a ton there's you wrote that movie apparently I always forget that on top of your of your acting career you are a gigantic Hollywood so unhappy I don't know why I think it's a combination of your personal life next with your you know your professional achievements did yeah most of my days are spent wondering how the fuck did he will get that but you came in here on a gold hovercraft that's true I mean and I like you're one of the richest men in Hollywood I've noticed you hovercrafts don't exist as far as we know and yet you came in we were like oh I guess they did and it's even last year's I gotta take it to turn it in at Jim Falk hovercraft in Beverly Hills she's a hovercraft dealership yeah it's weird it says Jim Falk hovercraft of Beverly Hills but it's actually just on Wilshire really okay he started cheating really yeah he's told ya Beverly Hills post office maybe post office yeah exactly Scott who is not gonna be on this podcast in a 10-hour podcast well I had to make some cuts so that you guys could go as long as we're going right thank you you know but yeah look who are we bumping yeah you can't have every single person who's ever been on this weird out yeah he's gonna show

what episodes in dollars or in Bitcoin oh in Bitcoin well how much is a Bitcoin now it's like one Bitcoin I remember when bitcoins were $150 and now they seem to be $1,200 and then sometimes they don't exist and then sometimes there are a million dollars yeah I think I've made depending on the market I've made approximately 4,000 bitcoins off of this yeah not bad so $16 somewhere around there it depends on the day but yeah so you you guys shouldn't complain about your career so look at me I'm trapped in this room for 10 years oh god you haven't in this room for 10 years I have it smells

possibly the very last guests on the very last episode of the show if no one else shows up and we still have six hours to kill oh boy wow so good to see them and I think that who's this now oh my I'm in shock I cannot believe it it's our old friend the Icelandic singer-songwriter Bjork hello welcome back to the show I haven't seen you in so long welcome back to life Scott I don't I don't know what you mean by that welcome back to life I'm very confused I overcome with emotion I thought you were dead you thought I would you thought I had perished yes I I got the email from your wolf and I I'm speed reader with me with my emails why is that why do you speed read your emails I get so many emails and they pile up so I like to speed read them how fast can you read an email would you like me to speed read out loud yeah please do yes oh my how long was that email I would guess maybe less than a sentence or no it's about a paragraph about six sentences wow that is incredibly quick I don't know how much you know about speed reading normally people don't do it aloud exactly but it's a radio show you only read like every six word is they trick oh I see now I always thought it was you look for the subject and then you look for the noun in the verb and that's all that you retain I even look for less I'm faster than a I'm one of the fastest speed readers in the world actually it sounds like it you introduced me as a pop singer but there's a whole other segment of society that just knows me as a top notch speed reader next time you're on the show I definitely will introduce you as the top notch speed reader I promise you so how did you what words did you read I just read did you read Scott and dead I wonder why those would be special and Scott and I assumed you were dead it was just they wanted me to show up and do something special and I'm so sorry to disappoint are you upset I'm alive or you're upset that you got the speed reading wrong no I'm upset that you're I'm upset just I'm overcome with emotion you're upset I'm the very thought of me being dead yes it's wonderful that you are alive Scott now why am I here well it's the 10th anniversary of the comedy bang bang podcast which you've been on for so many years but what's the I but what's the big deal like why I know it's not ending it's just I guess a celebration of an amount of time a decade of comedy bang bang and that's it I mean yeah just just 10 years yeah I mean and and maybe a few more after that it's not 25 that'd be special I realized that the Motown 25 special was an incredible television event where Michael Jackson oh by the way he's canceled moonwalked across the stage but unfortunately we haven't been on the air for 25 years that's why I thought when I spade read you you use intuition too and I must have seen 10 and gone I can't be just that so he's Scott 10 and special those were those are three words that I you were died 10 days ago or something I worked it into another logic all right well I I'm so happy that you're alive I appreciate you dropping by what the theme the show is but I'm happy to sing I what did I die I'm so embarrassed I I was set to sing a song special well that I would still like to hear it I mean you know this I feel like Tom Sawyer at my own funeral but I would love to hear what you were going to sing about me so yeah are you I see you brought a guitar here and yes I you know this I do the Elton John song that he wrote about Marilyn Monroe updated for Princess Diana yes after princess die I believe she died in a car chase scene fast and the fear is she think she was a stunt person on fast five I don't remember actually I remember she died you don't have one of the world's greatest memories she died in a car crash I remember were you speed reading movies as well yes I only watch subtitles subtitles yes well it was it was about Princess Die the last time he sang it I maybe there's been an update since then I don't really know she died Princess Diana she was in a car that crashed into something I don't know what it crashed into another car a telephone pole I really have no idea it's not important okay yeah I didn't think it was is that is there any lyrics about Princess Die dying in this no I sped read those lyrics too but the point thing is that I rewrote the song again to be about you that's fantastic I kind of you know I don't know whether Elton John would take umbrage with the fact that you're rewriting his okay okay I don't I don't give a shit about Elton John York I have worked with him you worked with him I don't I have we've been in the same concerts I've done at least four live with him if I see him again I will take his old hands and put them I'll take that the lid of the piano and I'll lift it up I've lost a whole one of his hands there now smash it down that is the worst thing you can do to a piano player okay I know they think they always go oh my fingers my feet surgeons and piano players go for their fingers I wonder if surgeons ever play the piano for fear of that thing coming crashing down on their fingers or vice versa or I wonder if they ever open windows you know in case the the window comes crashing down and crushes their fingers on the sill and do piano players ever do surgery probably not probably not themselves with the scalpel well I would love to hear this song Bjork okay it's you've come down I didn't know that that I'd ever be singing it to you Scott so I might be overcome with emotion okay well this is Bjork singing her update of Candle in the Wind Goodbye Scott Aukerman though I never know you at all some of the words are very close to the original just like the first read by you so far I think Scott Aukerman is the only difference but I don't know you at all beyond most people don't a few interactions yeah yes so far it holds up so far the original lyrics hold on goodbye Scott Aukerman though I never know you at all you had the grace to hold yourself while you scratched your balls underneath the table in the podcast studio we all knew what you were doing because your eyes would glaze over as you worked your nut sack and it seems to me you lived your life like an asshole who did not care never knowing what the guest was saying while your hand was in your underwear I would like to have been interviewed by you with your arms severed off but the last time I was on your show I saw you sniff your fingers right after you scratched your balls I'm so sorry it's so weird to do it in front of you and it seems to me you lived your life like an asshole did not care never knowing what the guest was saying while your hand was in your underwear and I would like to have been interviewed just once by you with your arms severed off because if your arms were severed off then you wouldn't be able to scratch your balls I understand the premise right unless you had like a I guess you could do it with one foot with your arms severed off and your feet and not to the train the mouse to scratch the balls but the last time I was on your show I saw you sniff your finger right after you scratched the balls right after you scratched your balls every guest has seen you do it right after you scratched your balls it's all so quiet shh shh shh I pictured that being the end of the memoriam as I transition it to it's so quiet that's the end of podcasting as we know it so it's like shh shh to podcasting world wow to a moment of silence in podcasting it's oh so quiet I'd like to think that if I stopped doing the show all podcasts would have to stop that's a nice sentiment that you would assume that sentiment I don't think anyone would buy it beyond that day of the memorial but we could all go yeah I get it Bjork that that was uh I can't say it was a moving uh I mean it definitely did move me to uh certain emotions not necessarily uh grief for sad uh think of you as Ted it is it is promise me if I do die that you will not show up to my funeral and play that why I well it'll be old by then you know it's you know it'll be an old song and you're not embarrassed about scratching your balls I don't think I do that that's why we admire you it's the truth look this is a very high table this is very low chairs the fact that my hands are underneath the table is not necessarily mean that I'm I'm I'm doing that particular but there's always a sound too like a scratching sound and there's guests on that side of the table we all please don't deny this I really don't think you have lice or crabs or something if I'm doing it it must be involuntary but uh I I don't think I do it I always saw it as like a power move like I don't care what the answer to your question is like man spreading I I don't think I do it but Bjork that that was that was very nice I appreciate it and please tell me you'll come back on the show more often I mean we haven't seen you in so long and don't do anything to Elton John he's he's a wonderful treasure if I see that little I will make him eat his oversized glasses and then I will take the piano lead and take out his little tiny old gray balls and bam and done again okay please don't do that to to Reg I won't mention his name but but Reg uh don't do that to him don't do that to me I will stick a candle up his fucking asshole that would be a terrible ironic way for him to go yes rewrite those lyrics now especially because you know the asshole is where the wind of the body comes out of all right Bjork it's great to see you thank you so much for dropping by goodbye it was an honor for me to be here for you okay we need to take another break but we will be right back with more of your old favorites and new favorites we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this comedy bang bang scott ockerman here and we're hearing from a lot of our old favorites and hopefully that will continue because I love the old favorites and oh I'm sorry did that did that actually did you pick that up on the mic oh yeah it's okay sorry sir we're I'm in the middle of a program here I I am actually uh I'm here from buzzard and I'm writing a little piece on you so I'm just I'm gonna shadow yeah I'm not sure what do you mean buzzfeed is that uh no it's a it's a brand new website we kind of cover uh sports entertainment politics a comedy fashion art and uh and kind of popular tourism spots you know we're kind of you know we're the buzzard we're we're picking at the carcass sort of hovering above uh the carcasses of everything that's out there actually that is our slogan yeah oh okay yeah including the sort of we put it in there because we want to feel like we're fresh and we're interesting and I'm so excited 10 years under which banner of those things that you covered does comedy bang bang fall under tourism art and uh and we're gonna put it in the comedy category we're gonna we have like a matrix yeah we do do me any small favors no no we're uh we're experimenting with a whole um kind of listicle thing about podcasts and so we're that'll be coming up in a couple months we're just kind of kind of tech checking out the technology okay thank you I guess tourism there are a lot of uh tourists and people new to Los Angeles who are on the show so I guess it makes sense to wander in here it's a stop you know it's a stop and uh you know I just feel like it's a it's one of those places you see the uh man's Chinese theater uh the capital records building the earwolf studios the Hollywood sign you know it's one of those things those staples on the uh one of the top four in Los Angeles I mean it has to be you know and it's a you know they always say it's a shame the Hollywood Walk of Fame doesn't translate all the way down here and then I found out it's on sunset that's why it doesn't even yeah exactly yeah I it's almost like it should just continue downward a little further and have like podcasters on the I would love that maybe uh you then maybe you call it like a podcast street or something I and again I'm an idea change the name of the street to podcast street I well I like I just look they do it for uh celebrities they do it Obama Boulevard that was something uh Chevy Chase Maryland uh right that they named almost the whole place in Maryland after this guy on Saturday Night Live and he wasn't even there for a long time I guess I was thinking of the streets in Glendale but again that's more of yeah that Bob Hope uh who was a great war hero I don't know but um anyway I'm excited to be here with you getting in your mind sir but what we're doing here is we're having a lot of uh older guests uh kind of returning it is an open door policy so you're you're certainly welcome to rest your feet a little bit but uh exactly what do you think you're doing here I'm doing a an article on you uh about the 10 years of comedy bang bang and I'm just gonna kind of just I would love to ask you a couple questions I want to just pop it in I'm gonna do one of those things where I just interview you and whatever you say I'm gonna put it in the article and that will be like a little Q&A style or uh thing yeah it seems to me like uh these days that's really all interviews are is they tape record the interview and then they transcribe it yeah just keep everything in there your um's your ah's and just slap it right in slap it right in yeah so that's what you have in mind uh yeah just so but if I can actually get this tape and that's that was the thing my tape recorder is broken so I figure if I came in here this will be a podcast and no problem don't worry about it transcribe it and get it all done great yeah okay wherever you get podcasts oh love it um first question what is a podcast oh okay so we're going back that far yeah let's get in let's get into it so you're one of the only people with a podcast oh no that's not the case anymore uh it may have been in the in the beginning yeah okay yeah so okay okay well uh podcast is uh sort of uh an ipod broadcast uh you can keep it a little bit shorter it'd be great shorter than that our audience once again have those quick hit and you know those quick okay okay sure I'll try to keep it shorter um uh program uh sorry yeah okay content love it okay great that's great good question one done love this this is great okay so you have the world's first podcast no I wouldn't say that there were plenty before me never not funny with jimmy parto yeah I'm gonna put it in there because it's gonna be a little bit more clickable for our audience okay I can see that yeah okay so I think that that's as long as you put me disagreeing in there you know it will we'll figure out we'll we'll suss it out in the mix you know we'll just yeah you know I kind of just I give my tape to my editor uh and he actually doesn't even live in los angeles he lives in cleveland he runs the whole site out of his uh this house was that named after the cleveland show I think it was and that show wasn't even that successful you must think that the state is so upset because they banked so much on it I mean you know Springfield obviously makes sense the Simpsons are very successful when are they going to change massachusetts to just family guy I mean I've signed the petition online numerous times I mean how many signatures do they need to get yeah I think you can only do one yeah per well I do change my name and I do have multiple email address what is your name by the way we haven't even gotten to that oh chip garvey chip garvey yeah very nice to meet you my dad was uh malcolm garvey oh no no oh steve garvey the bait yeah no who's malcolm garvey uh he actually works in plumbing oh why would you mention who your dad is I you don't find me introducing myself and mentioning who my dad is as if that's an explanation for my name I just you know I just thought you know it's always nice to have a little bit of uh you know we're in that kind of game of thrones era where we need to go backstory and everything oh I see okay so my dad did work in plumbing and that's what I don't know I don't need to know your backstory I think that you're asking me about my oh right okay yeah yeah but I think we do share some similarities was your dad into plumbing he was as into it as taking you know two or three shits a day sure that's very healthy uh you know and that's actually gonna keep uh according to my dad the more you flush the better off you are you may lose some of the the valve stickiness in the toilets but you think that it uh you know forcing the water through those pipes actually cleans it up going yeah that's a good tip from a plumber's son yeah you know and uh and you know uh they always say uh you know uh my father is mr garvey I am chip you know sure sure why are we talking so much about you you know what I honestly I just got lost in the whole thing all right so this is the 10-year anniversary of okay um sorry I gotta get through my notes here I can say it was never not funny uh no that's a different program although they're great you could maybe do a listicle about them oh I love that okay this is a comedy oh god I got that guy calm your bum bum bang bang bang I mean really it's no different what do you think about guns you're saying a lot of stuff about guns you know this is like a thing I mean I want to I want to get to these issues uh yeah I don't know that this is the place to really have this sort of debate okay I'll ask the next question thoughts on louis ck I don't I know this isn't the place all right I'll just go to the next one never been a guest okay all right all right great great great um not for our lack of trying to get him uh especially in the earlier years okay all right great these are just kind of popping these questions I have I have to ask a couple of these questions okay sure yeah I know that you're trying to to ask these provocative questions in order to get clicks so who was the worst guest that's a classic um yeah who did you hate I think uh there's there's a tea girlfriend there's this guy chip garvey who's kind of annoying me oh okay I'm gonna write that down chip wait a second that looks like my oh was there somebody who had my exact name there is someone who has your exact name who's a very annoying guest all right all right I'm gonna I'm gonna google that um okay okay worst guest got that okay talk to me about process the process of making the show how do you get all right so you come up with the idea for podcast and you have to like figure out where does it air on Netflix does it go uh on tv how do you get it from yeah a podcast uh uh it's actually something that you can get uh you know anywhere you can get it on uh stitcher you can get it on apple you can get it on spotify but the stitcher app is terrible though that's what I hear yeah like I tried to use that I could barely understand it yeah this is a podcast I have no horse in the race at this point so I don't really that's okay that's fine I just you know sometimes I mean I did review a couple of podcast apps and that was like that was a bad one I was like I was like it's funny look I've never been on it I have no idea what the ui is like oh yeah well it's the ui is bad believe me okay I'm a tech guy too I do you're a tech guy oh yeah I did like a you don't know what a podcast is wait you did a vacuum what I did a vacuum cleaner the the best vacuum cleaners you can buy on sale at amazon and I did like a kind of what was the number one uh you know what you're you're kind of putting me on the spot I think if I remember you should be on the spot if you're writing that article about it that's you know I guess the spot that you asked to be in I based it on pictures because uh they always say a picture's worth a thousand words so I put the three pictures of vacuums up there and that was your word count for the whole article yeah it was like I think that's three thousand words right there compare and contrast yeah I'd love to see that invoice I think I am still not paid I wouldn't pay you if I were them so I understand I have to turn around 15 articles a week oh wow that's like two a day plus an extra one on sunday I know and I try to do I mean the sunday one is but I call it mass and I kind of just go and I just kind of talk about what we're thankful for and stuff like that I do they're gonna change mass to family guy I wish I wish um so Scott yeah chip garvey okay tell me who is your favorite guest wow there's been way too many we've done almost 600 shows at this point anyone ever get killed on the air yes actually several people wow yeah constantly I don't know why it's happened I think wasn't my cousin Todd dead for a long time I don't even remember yeah the bodies were piling up for a while I'm actually I'm sending uh one of our interns he's uh right out of high school right now he's gonna listen to every episode consecutively I'm sorry binge it we're not gonna let him sleep and we're just gonna have him write a review of the entire the entire thing the entire show yeah that's gonna take a while I mean that's a probably a thousand hours worth of content no but you know what uh a doctor avoid it said don't do it and we said get out of here you're a lame old man and uh we're just like kind of putting on the headphones and just not gonna say no sleep till that article is written yeah I mean that's 40 days uh without sleep so uh jesus did it in the desert yeah that's true and we're and we have so much more technology let alone the nights yeah exactly 40 days 40 nights oh my gosh and hache never better than in that movie oh man and then adam sandler with the eight crazy nights oh my gosh and how about blind uh what is it uh uh ray ray charles I love the movie ray ray is great and jamie fox is a talent because he's more than just a mimic in my opinion he got into the soul of the character I mean when I did my recap uh I did I did a recap of every jamie fox uh sitcom every episode of the sitcom that he was on right what was that one called it was uh the it was on was it on fox I think it was called the jamie fox show not on fox not on fox yeah more on the cw or upn and again I write so quickly and I watch all this stuff it comes in one year and out the other because I'm kind of watching the jamie fox show in front of me I'm writing an article there but I'm also then listening to uh you know youtube video because I gotta write that article sure yeah your life sounds really really bad hey well you know what I love journalism I love I work for buzzard and we get paid uh by the article that's 15 articles a week that is 30 dollars a week that I pocket you get paid two dollars an article yeah I mean don't don't tell the people who work for free but yes I get paid 30 this is bad this is a bad system you need to uh I mean you need to tell buzzard is it you uh no I don't who owns buzzard I mean are they owned by a bunch of rich people no well look we are we are a company under jeff bezos uh jeff bezos himself yes uh so he bought the washington post and he bought buzzard okay um and he's keeping us organic or what he said we're still in the house in cleveland uh and right you know that's where the base of operations is and he doesn't want to interfere with us you know okay no he's he's the richest man alive I mean and he's oh there's so many ads he's so rich he's giving a ton of his money to his ex-wife and he doesn't even give a shit no I know oh by the way speaking of ads I have to do an ad right now oh yeah go ahead need a jacket of course we all do the best jackets come from a jacket maker all the way from ohio that's right it's chips jackets chips jackets are made from uh locally sourced jacket farmers uh all the way are you are you making jackets on the side I have to I go to the salvation army and I you just pick up jackets and say is that your jacket I cut a hole in it and I sell them online for a hole in it where look in the sleeves or something like oh okay distressing yeah you know michael jackson style oh no we can't talk about him he's canceled oh okay well uh well I don't know if you've been watching HBO recently I don't have it I bothered my my my dad's login but then my dad said you know what I can't just like you know I can't just get on the dole all the time you know so I have to yeah I can't watch it anymore that's too bad you should really uh keep up to date with things that are going on in pop culture if you're gonna work for buzzard well I mean if I if I look sometimes I'm just on art and I know a lot about art now a lot about what do you know about art and this is what I'm confused about well I did a piece on this guy who only used captain crunch for his art okay that doesn't sound like art to me that sounds like it was in a gallery in a subway in a subway sandwich shop yes okay I don't think that this is a gallery as much as they just have like they're popping up all over the place believe me I'm I'm out I'm crushing the beat uh you know I'm watching improv and laundromats uh I'm seeing it all yeah some of the best new improvisers are in laundromats oh I'm sure yeah you know uh wash fold and say yes okay and that's what it was yes and yeah okay wash fluff and fold and yes fluff like a fluff and yes and fold I don't know we're not gonna figure this either way I'm gonna use that as an article title because I do need one for that one yeah you're you've been writing the entire time you've been here by the way yeah I just actually published two articles while we've been talking not about you uh one was on the best jackets you can get that are locally sourced from Ohio okay you were just reading back your own article then for that ad because uh 90 percent of our site is ad driven uh yeah I would imagine almost all of it is what else would drive it I guess content but I mean yeah yeah so it's 90 ads 10 I thought you meant to where you get the revenue oh no no no no it adds it's like the page when you go on the page sometimes it's hard to figure out oh really just a lot of pop-ups or yeah are they just embedded right there in the games and stuff like you can shoot like a penny at like the like Lincoln's head and if you do it enough time you get like a free amazon card but it doesn't really work you just get sent to the site that kind of steals your credit card information oh okay that sounds cool yeah it's cool I mean look Chip I would get out of this business I mean this is draining your soul no no no let me ask you a question any spoilers for the upcoming season of comedy bang bang no we haven't recorded them yet I have no idea I'm still trying to finish this one if you would maybe you know again this interview I'm not here I'm just you are here watching I'm just a fly on the wall I do need these tapes I think the interview is going good um all right let me ask you a couple uh let's go to the phones we no we don't take phone calls no wait why would you want to go to the phones okay all right that's you're not the host of this show okay I just you know I thought we may have phones um I'll just ask why are you on your phone right now by the way I'll ask you a quick question um okay friends or Seinfeld meaning friends it's part of a larger quiz where we're asking a bunch of different celebrities friends or Seinfeld I wish Seinfeld was my friend I worked with him once but uh I wouldn't I would you work with Seinfeld we're friendly we were friendly to each other that day maybe so you like you like Seinfeld over friends well I'm trying to think if I've ever met any of the uh the actual friends yeah oh Jennifer Aniston I guess I met her uh who else never met Courtney Cox I just did a big feature on Courtney Cox here's what I'm wondering and I've asked this on the show for so many weeks and no one will tell me how did the friends know each other before the first episode of Friends because we know Jennifer Aniston came in and was was uh you watch the flashback episodes no that's the thing no I would watch them if someone would point me to them or like let me know like what the situation is but I keep bringing it up I keep asking and no one will ever tell me it's like twitter is a wasteland out there no one no what AA they all met at AA AA their friends at build w yeah exactly that's so that's why the show was so popular is because it showed how they respect the code they never talk about it wow that makes sense they're all in AA uh and and and I think that's what gives them this kind of edge you know they're they're trying to find happiness now that they have to stop now that they have to restructure their life around they have this meeting in a coffee shop all the time or that's why they drink so much coffee exactly okay this all makes sense all right yeah and that's why and Phoebe's sister on the show is an alcoholic still so they kind of shun her a little bit yeah I would too yeah why wasn't she one of the friends because she's an alcoholic it all makes sense yeah I mean there you go there she blows well thank you I finally got my answer and no thanks to any of the listeners out there yeah all right so we got the Seinfeld Friends we got that that's a piece um we'll put that out tomorrow okay I really hope you don't I mean rank your season complete rank your episodes there are no I've done almost 600 episodes I can't rank every single okay top four episode what 318 got it okay um I don't know 96 yes okay great oh that's a good one fan favorite yeah I guess uh 212 oh Andy Sandberg and uh 528 okay wow that's great that's a great list right that's another article put that on the side okay sure anything anything else I can do for you yeah this is great we're getting breaking these up into tinier articles because they don't seem sustainable we've seen that uh the average length of a reader on our site is um 15 to 35 seconds so what we try to do is try to put it in an infographic so you can kind of just get the gist at the top and in the first sentence if you we try to have a three sentence rule on all articles so right now no longer than three sentence yeah I mean we do put like um like a dummy text underneath it so it looks like the article's longer but it really is those first three so you just you know so it looks you know I actually don't mind that because anytime I see an article linked on twitter and it has the headline I'm like I got it from the headline well yeah you've read my thing um cute celebrity babies who grew up to be old ugly old people uh who were that is really mean who did you pick though it was uh there was a baby in a Coppertone ad there was a baby in a pasta commercial and what we did was we um this is actually the most investigated journalism I did I found those people knocked on the door open up you don't have to give me the sound effect of the knocking I appreciate it well some places had doorbells I refused to ring them because I just don't like robots uh you don't like robots made them made them wait this is a whole side part of your personality that I think is very explorable well that's why I don't work for the other things I don't I will not cover robot stories at all okay all right yeah so I uh I knock on the door and I just grabbed a picture with my cell phone camera and I put them up and I said ugly you know ugly and cute baby ugly person you know so it's okay you know gives people hope if they were cute or if they were ugly babies they'll be uh cute later on Coppertone baby wasn't that like Jody Foster or someone or what drew yeah did you go to Jody Foster's house I just take a picture of her and put her online saying she's ugly honestly Scott I'll tell you them I didn't really do that much research I just I saw people at a local mall that I was at and I thought oh it looks like the baby from the cup oh okay you just took pictures of ugly people I couldn't I needed to pump out again that was in the beginning when I was an intern so I was doing 25 articles a week and I just had a lot of lawsuits that you're part of I can only imagine you know what I have been sued a handful of times when you say a handful you're holding up both hands and your feet yeah and I'm also making a very wide gesture so it's a lot like so it's almost like a giant's hand it's like when you shake a pencil go rubber pencil rubber pencil right yeah a bunch of them so just countless lawsuits yeah and a lot of them uh you know if you don't show up because they can't sue you no that's not true what you're thinking of is uh traffic tickets if the cop doesn't show up oh then they you you get out of your ticket I should remake I should pull back that article I wrote then that is you wrote an article about that that's gonna cause some confusion yeah just don't show up to the lawsuits all right now I guess I'm in a deeper are there liens on your property and uh well I mean if I if you okay first of all I'd have to own property to have a lien on it okay so right now are you able to rent an apartment I would imagine that you're you're unrentable yeah I am a little bit uh what I am actually doing right now I'm I'm writing uh you could check out the website I'm doing a seven-part piece called uh living the camping life uh living in your car and I am actually yeah so I'm just kind of talking about the fun of the adventure of car living okay so that's kind of I'm using that to yeah well I'm 30 a week I mean yeah I mean it would be hard to get a little bit like a king you're right uh not really what I was gonna say maybe Burger King but uh okay so what do you know about Burger King uh you know standard operation does he run basically is he Trumpian or is he more like an Obama figure in your mind because I feel like is he a dictator or is he a benevolent yeah like you know elected I was gonna say socialist or dictator but whatever okay yeah we're on two different sides of the aisle on this one I think but uh I I think Burger King he's he's benevolent because uh you know you can one can go to McDonald's on one day and then still be a subject of the Burger King I love that that's an article that's an article that's an article we're just doing again we're getting a lot of different celebrities so far that's not just me uh when I say celebrity I got a lot of generous to myself I got a lot of I got a lot of people uh I'm gonna talk to a lot of okay okay all right so yes chip music for James Corden by the way how many more questions do you have I mean as many as I can get out before you kick me out because I gotta I have to physically kick you out that's the way I kind of run all my interviews okay what is it like to do the music for James Corden okay I'm gonna physically kick you out right now all right all right guys come on come on see you later oh god wow when I put out the call for all of our old favorites I didn't know new people would be showing up uh that was exhausting uh but speaking of exhausting uh we're almost halfway through the show and uh okay it's time to party it's time to rock and roll oh my gosh air horn noises etc it's uh welcome to the show it's Gary Urbanski thank you so much I wondered if you remember my name of course I do you're gonna be like hello friend you know sometimes you do that you see somebody on the street you're like hey guy but you know my name no I know your name of course you've been on the show several times you're from the windiest of cities I am indeed then transplanted to this great state of California then did get deported back to Illinois and now I am back on a conditional uh visa provisional yeah I didn't realize that we had the ability to deport people from state to state oh you can't if it's if it's serious enough you can't but you know we worked it all out we worked it out so I'm back baby and it's your 10th birthday happy birthday it's the show's 10th birthday I'm not a 10 year old man happy Halloween then you look beautiful you're not even wearing a mask where are your costumes Gary is the owner and proprietor or the former owner and proprietor of the urban ski uh store is that what it's key people thought it was urban sky may she rest sky may she rest I thought there was skis involved too I can't recall it was wig and weave maybe the e sound from that is tripping you up okay well also I I thought maybe I couldn't remember how it was spelled whether it was uh oh it's sky because we're check we're not we're not polish right that's a big point of contention you know dos doyevsky said you can never really know what's in a person's mind I did not realize that he said that but that's so wise well how could you you never met ronnie dos to have ski he grew up with my block how would I know what's in his mind absolutely he grew up oh wait this is not the famous writer dos doyevsky I mean he's written a couple of little poems and journals and whatnot but I don't know if he's famous maybe on blue island he's famous but other than that I don't know it's just ronnie okay well there's a more famous dos doyevsky then who I suppose you're gonna tell me there's a more famous gary urbanski then I think you're the only one oh well then I'm the most famous one is there a more famous scott ackerman oh no I I hope not I pray not oh are you otherwise I think I got to sag first I'm not sure I I don't know what that means are you the is there a less famous is what I should ask I think I'm the less famous Scott ackerman are you both somehow somehow well happy anniversary to the both of you thank you so much what have you been up to I do you have any new businesses in the mix oh let's run down your former business oh yeah well originally way back when I had kimono store uh that I shouldn't even bring up it's just it never did well it never was gonna do well then I did uh urbanski's wig and weave then which uh you know of course supplied a lot of hair care products primarily for the african-american community and uh then I had a pace picante salsa medium which was of course my napa winery it was beautiful very confusing though to name your winery pace picante salsa medium I don't I mean you not confusing to me though stay afsky um then uh you know after that I tried to uh sell some of my items for charity after that I I don't know I just been running around but basically what it all led to is a mild case of racketeering that did get me deported from the golden state of racketeering how does one accidentally racketeer someone I don't know I mean I I I thought it was uh I thought we were just having a meeting about some trash cans on my block and it turns out I had joined some sort of organized crime syndicate I am not allowed to speak on it some sort of protection racket is that what it was perhaps perhaps I just wanted more those blue cans you know the big blue recycling cans they're so great you know in chicago I don't know if you know this but our recycling is not exactly uh there's a big conspiracy there's not exactly being recycled you know I I've heard that about los angeles as well they just they throw it all in the trash throw it in one big bucket the streets and sanitation does no offense to all my cousins and uh sisters and whatnot they work in the streets of sanitation oh yeah no offense to them and no offense to all the los angeles uh recycling people as well I'm sure you're doing a great job it's just I I understand there's too much well I don't know but I just wanted more blue bins and so I thought I was joining a meeting about that I'm sorry they said the fed said I can't be talking about this that's part of my conditional visa allowing me back into state I see but I did want to come back and just tell you thank you so much for promoting all my businesses it did not help it did no I think they've all gone under so all sank and got me into legal trouble manny maybe I'm the problem maybe this show is the problem honestly this is a confrontation happy anniversary explain yourself I'm sorry look you can stop being on the show if you like I don't think that I can't no one's inviting you I think every single time you just burst in on an ounce I feel like when I drive by this building and sunset boulevard here I have to jump out just coming to you and calling to you well it seems rude to not stop by a friend you drive by a friend's house you don't go in and say hi no that seems impossible rude how weird every single time you drop by a someone's house you you just wander inside you know sky think you're so hollywood that you don't know like in the midwest we have these values right right I don't think I have time to listen to value oh my goodness someone's saying whoo I can't tell whether it's singing or a bachelorette party announce yourself whomever is hello hello oh uh hi uh is it can I can I talk now I recognize that swastika this is charlie Manson what oh hello the ghost of charlie Manson it's oh charlie Manson oh blowing back in here as ghost as the day is long uh you do look ghost as shit right now if I can't say so ghost af you uh ghost afski ghost dief ski oh he lived on 63rd okay uh charlie Manson you were on the show right before you died and I think we recorded it merely days before you passed away and then yeah since then you've been on as a ghost yes yeah this show is my real bad luck charm I'm going on this show I think really I apologize you died right after all of your businesses died yeah this seems to be a common problem yeah have you ever wondered is your show cursed sky I've started to think that honestly I mean uh you know I hear about all these other shows like serial and uh you know uh uh yeah serial nothing but good shit happening on that one yeah I mean the numbers are lucky protagonists from cereal I guess I mean the numbers are so big mine seem to have plateaued well you know nothing gets ratings like goofing about murder yeah that's true maybe if I did talk about more murder I mean you were sort of murdered on the show this could be this is great oh are we doing a true crime oh here's the truth I was murdered Scott Ockerman murdered oh Charlie Manson I'm not the one who's murdering people I as a host I just want to talk about like if you were gonna murder somebody you should murder a real animal like no offense a real animal like Charlie Manson I'm not an animal too scary his animals really spooked me let me tell you you ever seen a cat a cat that's the scariest animal you could think of well they look harmless but then they open their mouth they got those two sharp teeth well yeah on the sides of their little teeth Andrew Lloyd Webber and I were talking about cats earlier in the show glad I wasn't there yeah I mean that's uh it's a cra I mean have you heard about what they're doing they're shrinking all the actors for that movie and making them two feet high you know honestly that's even scarier than a big cat because with their two feet high they can sneak up on you yeah it seems crazy I don't want to come across any of them no no so you're right that is very scary I don't want to do that uh Charlie what have you been up to you're a ghost uh obviously well I can't remember what happened the last time we spoke well you know I I was in I would I had just become a ghost right it was all new to you it was all new to me and now I've been a ghost for a year I've been just ghosting around all over the place you've been ghosting folks oh I've been ghosting folks all the time I say hey you want to get a drink and then I blow up into the sky and they I just look like an old sheet blowing into the wind well initially you look like Charlie Manson that's the scarier part of this do you want to get a drink with me Charlie Manson I mean I think they would they would actually be happy that you ghosted them no everybody wants people want to get a drink with me Charlie Manson's a real fuck boy am I right well I got long hair it's and it's coming back classic yeah I guess so I don't know whether the aesthetics are really all that you know pleasing enough to overcome the fact that you murdered so many people what do you what do you mean would you would you make me over do you think I should be dressed in different it's should we do a queer eye all right yeah we just tested out pilots wait a minute Gary are you uh all right I mean I think one of us has to actually be I mean we're gonna do a true queer eye thing you're right okay so do we just what about why don't we do the straight guy part of the equation remember how it used to be queer eye for the straight guy we'll just be the straight guys okay I'm not gay okay no that's okay just don't you dare call me gay oh Charlie Manson is as straight as the day is long Charlie is that one of your triggers oh my gosh what no I'm you seem real stressed out about it you know I just I I only love girls that's it just seems intense you uh you don't need the you know if I see a boy I close my eyes I don't want to see him how did you survive in prison well I always had my eyes closed yeah I would think I mean you you weren't allowed conjugal visits or anything well noble but I did get married you did get married yeah forgive me I don't recall every single detail of the Charlie Manson I think knowing that much about you makes one a creep well yeah I I love creeps you and TLC and Stone Temple Pilots and Radiohead oh yeah oh excuse me I'm coming in can't decide where to go but here I am oh no I think the fact that I've mentioned cats I heard you talking about cats before has summoned one of the stars of the musical cats when you talk about cats then I have to show up it's the Rum Tum Tugger is here oh my god in a chair then I'll sit right on your lap if you put me in your lap then I'll jump around the room is that Charlie Manson even Rum Tum Tugger knows who Charlie Manson is yes I'm a celeb but I'm are you a cat are you a man oh funny question that you'd ask I am both because I couldn't decide so I had skin grafts oh this is originally the Rum Tum Tugger was the actor who portrayed the Rum Tum Tugger then was tired of getting the makeup on every day was that it's a lot of makeup to put onto your head so if you have it sewn in place then it's easy yeah so he got the skin grafts and now is forced to talk like the Rum Tum Tugger for the rest of his life honestly it's easier at this point well I you know I'm just glad you're a man and not a cat uh and I can relate to the skin grafts because I similarly carved a swastika into my face because it was too much work to draw it on every day hey this is this is twice now we've heard the word swastika in the span of about 15 minutes I'm just having trouble adjusting I'm sorry but that's so it's such a big part of the Charlie Manson lore I wasn't super familiar but now I guess I know I don't know how you really get around it I mean it's right there in the middle of his forehead I understand not everybody likes it I've been covering it up lately sometimes yeah how do you cover it up do you put like putty into oh really it's bangs yeah I got bangs I I'm they're slicked back now because I know you want to see the old Charlie Manson swastika no I don't want to see the swastika pull those bangs in front please okay okay watch uh Scottie wants to see a symbol of hate so uh I welcome you here ghost of Charlie Manson but I don't know if we're gonna be hanging out if as a ghost you think that you could actually like alter your physical appearance somewhat there's more rules to being a ghost than you would even imagine well Andrew Lloyd Webber and I were talking about angels how you know we were we were wondering if they still had the feet and he says they do and they just kick like uh they're swimming when they're when they fly around but yeah are ghosts different yeah ghosts ghosts are different ghosts you lose your feet you do lose right yeah I was gonna say I've never seen feet on a ghost yeah same thing when you're a cat you exchange them for paws now you mentioned A.L.W. was he here he owes me 10 bucks he does for what 1983 opening night I bought him a tie and he didn't pay me back oh okay now I I have a question for Mr. Tumtugger absolutely Mr. Tugger or Mr. Tumtugger I prefer Mr. Tugger since I've been a ghost I've had time to enjoy a lot of cultural events and I recently blew well what a weird sentence like what are you what are you talking about since you've been a ghost you've had time to go to cultural events yeah because before I was so busy okay and so I had time I blew into the Pantages and saw the recent production of Cats oh I see a cultural event a cultural event I see because before I was so busy smoking around you're in jail yeah you're in jail for ye for decades yeah and you know what they say nothing's busier than being in jail that is true that is what they say so you have a question about Cats is that what yeah um well my first question were you part were you part of that production I was not but I stood in the wings nearby only one lady fainted I consider that a personal best I know I couldn't figure out now what what what the heck is a jellicle cat that's the question no one has ever been able to answer anytime they see Cats I I've been thinking about it for a long time because now that I'm a ghost I got a lot of time to think sure yeah I mean I mean those cultural events don't fill up the calendar the way they used to no no right so what what is a jellicle cat let me put this simply for you guys a jellicle cat is what a jellicle does and a jellicle does what a jellicle is jellicle cat in the jellicle sky a jellicle you me guys jellicle jellicle in a bite jellicle cat okay thank you I think that clears it out I I really I want him to stop talking I just I'm singing or whatever it is it's not even singing it's like a comedy it's not even rapping it's a little bit like uh like a robot was taught to speak and then got a little stuck I don't know whether Rum Tum Tugger is an AI or not I oh oh if he's an AI get me out of here you don't like AIs or ghosts afraid of AIs well they're they're unhauntable I would assume well AIs and ghosts are natural enemies of course oh I had no idea yes I'm gonna need a software update soon are any of you fluent in Linux sorry I know cobalt but that's about it yeah I can I know c++ those will both work if you have an hd in my adapter okay I don't plug it in plug it up and get me rebooted okay I think we've determined that Rum Tum Tugger is an AI I'm Rum Tum Tugger and I am an AI what version are you um version 10.0 leopard snow okay well oh my gosh this is enlightening I feel like I'm learning so much Scott I take back everything I said about how your show is cursed and how uh no thinking person who can read should go on it uh I don't remember you saying that I said it all I wrote it on this table uh I take it all back Charlie Manson you need help but since you are a ghost I don't know where you're gonna get it but you have a lot of time to get it so please you know explore your therapy options but uh I got I do have to leave because my ankle bracelet is starting to shock me oh really which means I shouldn't have ever come so I gotta go yeah well I appreciate you all dropping by it's it's so nice to see you I mean I I guess it wouldn't be a 10th anniversary without Charlie Manson and Swastika coming by so that is that that is my cue that is the last time I needed to hear it okay thanks it's only for you goodbye ghost of Charles Manson oh I can't say good to see you but uh interesting nonetheless oh boy that was uh spooky definitely and uh I think that uh hello okay hello Scottley Scottley are you in there oh look it's our boy Scottley is this who I think it is is it bever hopox chico hands you got that right and Bisbee st hancock property afternoon collectively known as the Kevin's triplets Scottley what is with all these balloons uh well uh it's my 10th anniversary of the of the show that you have appeared on a scant few times you're horsing I'm not is that a term in the horse fighting business for you're doing well you're having fun I didn't even realize what I was doing I guess it is now yeah that's right as a horse fight promoter I should have made I should have taken better advantage of that but no I just came up with that on the spot right now okay you mean am I fooling with you I thought you was missing 10 years you don't look like it could be a day over 16 I started this when I was six yes thank you so much uh it's so good for those of you who don't remember but I can't imagine anyone who doesn't these three gentlemen are uh promoters of horse fights where horses uh beat and stomp each other to death more punching than stomping there have been there have been some changes to the rules we're trying to ride we're trying to eliminate stomping oh really so this is uh this is like the NFL where every year they come out with new rules in order to some new rules there's a whole team of scientists analyzing I thought Bill Maher might show up is Bill Maher here? No he's not he's not he's not we may have some new no-nos but okay but uh uh yeah so what are the changes to the rules that you have uh this year alone is uh padded boots padded boots for the horses for their hind hooves kind of oh okay and then the boxing gloves of course for the front hooves yeah there's always been those big inflatable for safety for safety purposes thank you Bisbee that's all right I'm fine don't worry about it everything okay Bisbee I'm fine he seems a little addled almost as if he's taken a few too many horse punches for safety reasons well I'll tell you what the reason we're here Scott Liz cuz cuz Bisbee had he had a doctor's appointment upstairs so we just happened upon we said oh really at the doctor's office just two floors above us that's two floors above the airwolf studios is everything okay that's 44 steps thank you Bisbee thank you yes everything all right Chico uh well we're gonna find out uh once we get word from the doctor that's how doctors work oh okay but uh is something bothering you or no not me no Bisbee oh it's Bisbee oh right sorry Chico I thought you were the one who went to the doctor no no Bisbee went to the doctor is what are some of his symptoms well we all went to the doctor sure for support okay why do you live a little bit more literal why don't you okay we all stepped into the doctor's office that was sarcasm oh me too no no it's not Bisbee no Bisbee you don't want to get in on the me too movement that way you want to do it honestly yeah right um so uh uh uh Bisbee's been acting a little strange he's very he's he's he's uh he's been suffering from uh what can only be described as the horse mumps the horse mumps what exactly are the horse mumps and can one be inoculated from them well four months ago i came down with the horse mumps woke up they came in gave me my bucket you know what is the bucket i don't think we've ever covered the what bucket do you receive in the morning each morning we wake up and we give each other buckets to relieve ourselves oh okay there uh you have a beautiful new stadium i thought why are there no state of the art state of the art why are there no worthless urinals wall to wall waterless it's one one large urinal that goes on in the search so dry with pipes but in the sleeping quarters the p trough there are no working uh plumbing well that goes back to our you full days that's right we could have we could have all the work work and plumbing we want but just out of custom we prefer a bucket you prefer the bucket it's like a hipster when he uses uh vinyl records instead of an empty okay we love using the bucket it's retro it's a retro party it's retroactive what i find interesting is is you give each other buckets instead of just having one that you keep but you wake up in the morning and get and give each other buckets are you that's right that's right yeah you're assigned uh another person well everyone flips over a card and depending on which card that's what bucket you receive so bever and chico do you ever get each other and then busby just flips over his own card or if then you have to redraw okay how often does that happen you have to redraw no joke no joke there was one time where it took 14 hours 14 hours for 14 hours straight three people it's very very difficult we're not going anywhere till bucket disbursement has happened right proper you know how hard it is to hold your insides for 14 hours while you're going through this i got why why not just pick out your own buckets guys well it's just not tradition it's not the ceremony mention our preference for custom right okay so you woke up someone gave you your bucket and you gave someone else their bucket that's right and i realized i had some bumps on me okay these are uh splotches or some sort of discoloration okay when you say mump you mean it's a mound and a hump it's a is that what mump is an abbreviation of mountain mountain mountain hump if i know anything about diseases stuff is exactly what they sound like right so a mump is like oh you can pretty much it's a mumpy visualize humpy bumpy bump that's right so and you had one of these or more right bever of my bever reminded me that i hadn't gotten my horse mumps vaccination oh no i got my if you're gonna be working with horses you have to get that well that would have been smart wouldn't it scott scott can you come over here let me whisper to you come over here yeah whatever come on three of us should talk bizby you just uh occupy yourself okay hold on one two three four yes chico i think the mumps might be sleeping into his brain because he thinks he has horse mumps when quite clearly he has pony mumps oh okay i don't know the difference these are are the are the are the size of the mumps different of course smaller smaller not as developed okay so it's like the small pox is different from the chicken pox well there's big pox right yeah okay so you think that that one pony mump has just seeped into his uh medulla umbiligata if i'm saying that correct you're the doctor i'm not sure i'm not the doctor you just saw the doctor we're worried about his brain oh my gosh we're worried about his heart as well oh no we're worried what the doctor has explained to us upstairs right is there with horse mumps you can just sort of drink enough water and eventually it'll take care of itself right pony mumps they're young they're strong young strong they are viral they are deathly viral at any moment they just run through your blood like tiny ponies and you can't find them and if it attaches to any of the organs inside your body that organ will explode oh no you need most of those yeah that's from what i understand oh my gosh is there any cure 90 91 well we hope we find one you're just gonna find what the doctor didn't suggest any we're waiting for an email from him okay well if you get one during this taping please let me know i promise we will you'll hear like the sound of an email coming in of course we would ding bong it'll be like a okay but that wasn't it right that was yours that was your impression okay yeah yeah 100. oh come on back to this be this be can i do you mind if i uh you're wearing a hat of some sort uh do you mind if i take a look at your scalp without the uh oh boy here we go oh my gosh that hat is stuck to your skin the skin's coming off you're gonna have to move up to an 11 gallon oh my goodness the the seeping pores on top of that head you're fumes when did you lose all of your hair well that's one of the symptoms of uh horse mumps horse mumps yep yes that's classic classic horse mumps and they say though the sooner you lose your hair well the sooner you're going downhill faster and that's why we came by today i wanted to say goodbye to you scotland oh this doesn't necessarily have to be the end of you bizby i mean i'm sure there are plenty of people who drink enough water when they get horse mumps that's right like the doctor said you gotta drink that water teeter totter please your daughter because you're staying on long uh because you drank your water got rid of them horse moms right so please your daughter not sexually bizby no i wasn't saying it like that oh you will be in sarcastic yes we taught him a new word so drink up i mean uh you have some water there it's just water help with pony mumps oh no it's bad for me it's bad for the word it's terrible because we've got to keep with the illusions right just for his state of mental health i don't know how long i can keep this from him hopefully long enough for an email to come in i mean we'll hear the sound yeah it'll be like but that was not it right that was just my mouth that was your mouth right yeah i feel very much worse oh oh my gosh bizby you you look seconds away from death's door they say that at the last minute you'll know you're going because your heart will explode your heart will explode and that's how you'll know that will be the last the last clue just suddenly you'll you'll get will it be like a that's by the way that's not the sound of your heart exploding it'll be more like a and that's not the sound of the email yeah no that was my mouth you made me check you did a phantom check i checked on my i checked on my flip i want you to know though i appreciate everything all you've done for me yeah well i would hate to see if the calvin's triplets went back to calvin's twins why uh just for progress sake i mean it seems like the next step would be calvin's quadruplets yeah and then uh after that would be calvin's uh what was that andy richard show quintuplets quintuplets that's right that's our favorite show oh really nope well maybe you could watch an episode and and cheer up your spirits uh that's a good point you mind putting it on sure yeah we have several we have the videotape right here yeah just occupy yourself it was under andy saves the universe your box set of andy saves the universe well you know it's uh yeah it should be under q it was under a i love this episode guys he doesn't have much longer to live you gotta get him off the water is possible i guess how long did the doctor say he was going to take i don't know with the email with the email yeah he said he was gonna uh see several more patients then go to lunch what then tea time at the golf course oh no see he's drinking tea at a golf course why i think so he's a very fancy doctor only the best for our bizby okay so when did he say he would get back to you after all that or no he said sometime therein yeah oh my god does he ever play golf when he's at the golf course does he ever like take a big swing like a oh scott oh that was my mouth sorry i'm making a lot of whooshing sounds i've been waiting for the okay yeah sorry that was me no 60 61 why is he counting while he watches quintuplets is he trying to count the the actual he's trying to count the television structure he would have stopped at five oh my gosh 72 73 and let's go maybe i should send an email to the doctor send an email to the doctor yeah all right does it make the same sound when you send it as when when one you receive i believe it does okay so mine makes you work clip clap oh oh that's right that's going away you bought that amp that's right right okay you're a quick typist by the way you seem to be done with it all right send it off here we go okay it's sent great all right well now i guess there's nothing to do but wait until in silence in total i have a feeling and just a little more water i think that's a good idea sure it is take some of mine if you have the horse mumps that'll cure it guys don't you think maybe he should save it for later oh his nose just fell out my nose my nose it's in the glass oh god well if it's in the glass drink it that's what i always say that's just part of the saying isn't it yeah if it's in the glass drink it if it's in the bucket don't forget if it's in the if it's in the other room take it to the saw mill how often do you say this uh i just without exaggeration 100 times an hour it's true look guys thank you so much for dropping by it really means we'll never get resolution on this it seems because this doctor is just oh god everything all right bizby miss me was that an email oh my was that shh oh yeah it's pony mumps oh bizby's heart exploded and one of his buttons flew off the his shirt it's ricocheting around the studio look out he's gonna catch it ping-ponging sing song oh my gosh ring and rogan oh poor bizby you hate to see him go that way oh man oh but he's dead and he's officially dead happy 10th anniversary of scotley well it wouldn't be an anniversary of the show without someone perishing on the show oh boy terrible terrible news we'll drag him out yeah he doesn't have any relatives other than you does he oh wait someone's at the door i don't not that i'm aware of um oh my bizby is that you what bizby you're on the floor but i'm looking at you right

batch of horse apples right i was taken to a uh a home and tied up by my brother he was trying to infiltrate your horse fighting ring oh thank god you didn't let him oh god you know what that was just and you know what that makes sense because one he he kept saying we should franchise all the time in fact he was saying that more often than what bizby does say 100 times an hour which is which is uh if if it's in the glass if it's in the class drink it that's what bizby said well not the whole thing though i say it a little different than sure sure but i say if it's in the glass drink it if it's in the if it's in the class learn it if it's down if it's downstairs crawl there if it's down uh if it's up in the clouds uh make it there uh take it to the end of the road uh hey take it to my favorite abode you'll always remember me uh regardless of whether you drink me but if it's in the glass and drink it it really is happy anniversary score today and of course you were inoculated for the pony mumps when you were a child right well i'm not sure about that oh my god your brother is still communicable oh his heart just you you've been slide your Roman chair away from here the button and the bullets ran into each other and canceled each other out oh my god i'm fine now oh oh thank god bizby the cow huh who'd you say wait who oh dear i mean yeah wait do you have horse amnesia horse

i'm scott ockerman i'm celebrating 10 years of comedy bang bang good for you i'm out of here okay no these are your brother dear oh he's he's gone and the last thing he said was live your lives wow great advice but still what a kiss off to his brothers what an unexpected turn of events uh i'm flummoxed i'm my i'm hurting in my stomachs yeah i'm i'm trickstromixed and i and i and it's a big old bummox i agree with you wow you didn't even know that that he he wasn't a triplet until a few years back but now that's right the loss must be immeasurable yeah well i mean i'm struggling with the loss of i'm i'm excited first let me let me retrace yeah rephrase please uh i didn't know about jisby i didn't know about just this is all new information the jisby thing reveal you got bizby never mentioned a brother or a twin brother no not does and so i'm still kind of coming down from the high of being a quadruplet right that much closer and also the loss of of bizby presumably being dead right well it was a lot of steps to process because being excited about jisby yeah losing what i thought was bizby right finding out it was jisby being sad about losing the jisby being euphoric for finding the bizby again then realizing the frisbees god so we can go to the beach after this play a little frisbee after jisby was holding a frisbee the entire time yep yep yeah well that's ours now sorry dead guy it's covered in in heart blood right i guess we've been inoculated for pony months so it's no problem no problem so a lot of steps to go through but uh so much emotion at this point you have lost a a quadruplet and you've lost another uh you've lost the triplet gained lost rediscovered found jisby was still alive for a second yeah and then you guys shot him so reanimated a lot of guilt trying to drip from his open sores yeah right onto his i guess our quadruplet brother bizby who's still alive yeah we never knew it while he was alive bizby survived that bullet button ricochet collision that was a wild ride yeah bizby blown a fuse with his horse nesha yep he's out wandering hollywood boulevard right now for all we know for all you know i mean what could he be doing what would a man with no memory be doing he's had the ripplies believe it or not okay yeah i mean it's great if you've never been oh i've been he won't remember if he should believe it or not right he'll just be like all right i don't know forget it well guys this is a terrible turn of events uh we're sorry to rain on your parade it's quite all right i mean you know what is the celebration for but uh to for family and to uh encounter uh uh people and their their problems so i hope that this works itself out i mean please promise you'll come back and we'll be searching the the ends of the earth to try and find bizby back into the phone what what's that what's going on hold on i i think i got an email it's it oh hold on i'm gonna read it to myself it's from bizby he emailed me i'm gonna read it to myself but you'll probably hear my internal monologue in bizby's voice oh okay that's a good plan if you can do that let's see here dear my dearest brother wow that is what he sounds like please share this with my other brother and my dead brother i left on the floor so sorry of course nija anymore i'm sorry to leave as soon as i left i'm sorry to inform you that i fell up the stairs back to the doctor all the way up to the doctor where they informed me that i also had a horse mumps in not just a normal way i have pony horse mom oh this doctor doesn't seem good at what he's dude just tell people that i'm surprised he's back from the golf course already that's true that's a fast tee yeah is pony horse the correct term i don't know we're splitting hairs here let's just listen to his internal monologue great idea that might have auto corrected pony horse mumps is not exactly what it's called it's called pony horse mumps so sorry it corrected again hold on it's pony horse mumps it's pony horse mums he's a guy i have they told me i have pony horse mumps and i should be fine wait a second i'm sorry i'm new with this android phone it's pony horse mumps that i have and i don't know they said that i could i could pass any time between tomorrow and 60 years so i don't know if i'll ever see you again i don't know if i ever want to put my weight upon you guys i'm live your life everybody live your life oh god i hate pony horse mumps signed business wow wow he never caught us up with how he lost his horse nesha no no but still it was probably from the pony pony horse mumps or whatever you kept getting autocorrect maybe you just know what it was it's probably just pony months yeah here let me let me open my phone okay and type in pony horse mumps and see what comes up okay it could be puny hues monk are you getting it did you mean is that yeah exactly yeah it could have been phony phony hump monkey no that's definitely okay it doesn't sound like what it is it could have been uh it could have been let's see here it could have been puke hats mouse that's a possibility that's a possibility yeah that's definitely puke cat's mouse he either died from pony horse mums or puke hats wow what a terrible way to go i can i know why he doesn't want to be a burden on you i mean it's terrible to see a relative in that state yeah so this is this is bad stuff so he's out there you know walking the ends of the earth like dr david banner and the incredible hulk and uh you know you'll probably never see him again he could be gone today could be 60 years from now that's a pretty broad range well no matter what here's what i hope that we're here celebrating 70 years of comedy bang bang and he walks in that would be perfect and drops dead right in front of us wow that would be on my 70th but yeah well guys thank you so much for being here please catch us up on what happens with this situation when you come back we'll send an email absolutely yes definitely and the good thing about you guys is you're so you have such positive outlooks uh and it i believe it all comes down to your just the way you live your lives you know listen listen listen scotley some people have successful comedy podcasts other people grow up on a ranch where they don't have an outhouse and have to crap and pee in a bucket with they hand to each other and their siblings and their folks and they grow up estranged from their quadruplets and one of those quadruplets tries to tie up the other one and then pretend to be that third quadruplet and then gets pony mumps and even though we tell him it's horse mumps and dies from it and then the third quadruplet comes back and and and he is here but then he decides to leave because of his horse nisha and then finds out that he actually has pony horse mumps which could be instead which could be pew cat's mouse oh that too and at the end of the day when you've spent a lifetime promoting horse fighting seeing beautiful majestic beasts beating each other to death on a on a daily basis you just know you gotta laugh oh guys thank you so much for being here beaver chico the calvins twins it's bev sorry we'll see you next time thanks for dropping by bye now all right we need to go to a break we will be ripe we're at the halfway point this is exciting we will be right back with more comedy bang bang after this welcome back to comedy bang bang scott aukerman here and uh wow we are halfway through our special 10-hour episode and by the way a little behind the scenes here uh chef kevin over here has been uh working tirelessly to try to figure out how to uh do the world's longest podcast how do we put out a 10-hour episode and it appears that there there are no hosting sites who can uh host a 10-hour episode everything needs to be uh seven hours and 53 minutes is the maximum i believe so uh when we got the the the grand idea to do this uh we didn't even know uh that we were technically not able to other than the interesting part is stitcher uh part of the earwolf family here uh is actually the only place that you can hear this as one long uninterrupted 10-hour uh episode so for everyone else we've had to split it into two parts uh so if you're getting it on uh itunes or if you're listening on spotify or whatever uh this is the beginning of the second part but uh if you're listening on stitcher of course we've just been rolling right through but uh welcome back to those of you who have been listening on stitcher and welcome if you happen to stumble upon part two for some reason and started there go back to the beginning i explain everything but i'll give you a brief brief explanation this is a 10-hour show where a lot of comedy bang bangs favorite guests from the past 10 years are dropping by with our open door policy and uh so far we've had so many great guests i think we're out of guests i think they're they're probably can be i can't think of a single other guest that's ever appeared on this show uh hey wait a minute i know that fonzie like a anywhere what's going on i wouldn't know it hey it's joey tortellini yeah back back at it from years ago years oh my god uh as i recall you were an uh an unemployed person from uh the sudan yeah i didn't have a lot going on uh although you did have a lot going on because on the weekends you would dj in las vegas for seventy thousand dollars a gig minimum sure what's the maximum uh 22 22 mil i think one was one was way too much you've made that no that's not just one gig yeah it was a festival you know these things right and then you have also won multiple lotteries yeah yeah yeah yeah so you're doing okay even though you're unemployed i don't know you don't know why uh you know lots of things going going a bit sideways oh okay you know i haven't seen you in years we've uh the listeners have always wondered whatever happened to you and we haven't heard uh uh you know any details of your life in the past maybe four years yeah yeah i you know unless you unless you subscribe to um a couple of the the minor magazines you probably wouldn't have heard too minor magazines that's not barely legal that's no no no well i did appear in an issue of how to help your teens barely legal edition because you've appeared in in photographs or as articles a photograph and a nice two-page spread um just because i was doing some outreach stuff and the cities and the streets and the slums just trying to get your message out there trying to help these teens yeah okay did you help them i helped a couple of teens get out of there they gotta go they gotta go to there i'm putting them in woodworking oh okay that's very nice of you but when you say minor magazines do you mean you just don't mean large publications yeah small town like what new york times washington post london express the london express wow that's huge bi-monthly it only comes out monthly 12 times a year apparently 12 issues you can collect them all and the fantastic page turners wow so what what have you been doing in these publications you've been writing articles or i don't know if you've been following but there's been a a big a big in online push to get me on the moon to get you on the moon to get me to get joey tortellini on the moon you personally not just anyone on the moon me personally you person and what connection do you have to the moon i mean as i recall you're from the sudan although you don't sound like it no not at all you worked for the sudanese government for a while and we were doing some crazy stuff in darf war or something i don't know i don't remember you're accused of certain uh uh uh war misdemeanors there was some shady business going right so then what do you have to do with that big ball of cheese up in the sky they it was in i as much as i have some people who are not big fans of me you don't say i mean you you've done some things in your past yeah but it's i am the beholder you know like sure sure yeah i have um a bunch of people who are big big fans and they want as a birthday gift to get me up there on the moons a birthday gift wow so would this be a private spacecraft going to the moon or they want to do the official us uh they want to do official nasa official nasa official this isn't some spacex mumbo jumbo what's-his-name doing his publicity yeah belan musk more like elon tusks because he because uh has a big nose i was a bit taboo i think okay and he's taboo like ivory is yeah baby yo you say baby too i think so that's great that's good to know about you do not who's on the list of people saying baby oh man so many people we got geno we got uh tracy reardon so many people say baby we keep a running tally oh i can i can calm down on the baby it wasn't my first that was pretty much my first time i was just trying it out oh okay well you know if the spirit moves you during this conversation feel free to pepper with a few more babies see if there's another opportunity thank you scott okay so they wanted to be official nasa because they wanted to count like it needs to be in continuity or something yeah yeah you don't it doesn't count unless you're going through nasa you know that oh really so you cannot say that you've been on the moon unless it's an official nasa all the russians and the chinese they're never been they've never been officially officially officially on the moon or mars because the the moon is actually u.s soil as i recall because we planted the flag and so yeah you know we don't uh allow people to emigrate to the moon i would imagine like russians and chinese yeah which is unfortunate because i mean well not it's it's frustrating to some of my friends in the sudinese government because they got their eyes on that they got their eyes on the moon they want to try to get there for years not gonna happen so then what are the steps how would you i presume you would have to go to space camp you would have to is everything all right you keep coughing air quality today in los angeles this is terrible i'm so sorry also your voice just your natural speaking voice is so gravelly it must be so hard on your larynx it's a tough one with such bad air quality so you would have to go to space camp which i saw a movie about back in the 80s jamie gertz was in it as i recall i did it i succeeded very did it yes they made me camp leader leader wow so your grade point average must have been really sky high 9.9 wow out of 10 out of 10 oh okay i was gonna say usually it's out of four so but people i had a four i know that doesn't make any sense at all i know why what's how what do you what how does it translate and then people get above four all the time because they take extra credit stuff so it's like you get a 4.5 or just make it 10 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 that's what they're doing space camp they'd never have anyone get 9.9 ever wow congrats what they called me they called me richter scale as a you know fun nickname was that fun for you i hated it scott i fucking hate so you don't want me to call you richter scale right absolutely if you can if you cannot i would it's very very tempting so i don't know if i'm going to be able to adhere to that request please find it in your heart scott please find it in your scale what made you so what made you so good at space camp i just did all the work and and you know what they were trying to figure it out the big the big problem is mars nowadays right what's the problem with mars they don't care about going to the moon they'll put me on there if they all want to get to mars they've they all want to get to mars right who's gonna get to mars that's the fun part for them is is to get to mars that's that's their off time that's the relaxation part day by day they're still trying to get to the moon right but on the free time mars mars mars mars and then why do your fans want to get you to the moon and not to mars because they think uh the moon is more achievable or it's just a you'd have to ask them is that all they could raise on the uh the gofundme the kickstarter was hey as a lark let's get joe tortellini to the moon very monday so they just want to send you to the moon uh for fun they raised how much money did they raise it seems like 22.6 trillion dollars oh my gosh that's a little i think that should cover it so it was yeah it's part of that bribes in order because you're not an astronaut not zero percent an astronaut but again you know if we did the spacex right it would be more achievable sure but that i mean with all that money like you could buy you could buy nasa i would imagine uh i would have to look into that why haven't you with that much money let me just get on my computer here oh yeah thank you brought a uh a little laptop here laptop here i'm gonna just go to buy nasa.com they got a running ticker of the price be careful that this isn't just to buy their website because a lot of people get you know if you want it says there this is not to buy the website yes a lot of people have right that's by nasa website that right right you need to go to squarespace for that oh yeah buying domains is simple over there so uh you're a son of a bitch i got you i tricked you into being in an ad oh son of a bitch okay so how much is uh they got a running ticker right and it's not that much it is just twenty twenty point one trillion so i'd actually be able to do it and still have a few trillion yeah have a little pocket money a little walking around cash couple two point if my math is right two point five somewhere in there yeah a little lettuce for your tomato yeah you know what the hell let's do it are you pressing the buy now button should i not it was your idea i think you should i mean then you can go to the moon you can go to mars you can do whatever the hell you go joey tortellini buy a nasa click one click purchasing it's it there's no cart there's nothing just buy now you have a credit card on file i would imagine obviously what kind of credit card do you have that it has that kind of limit who are you sponsored by i have no credit card sponsorships well maybe you can get that credit card money with american express black oh the blackest of american express can i see your american express black card is that sure that is so black that i can't even see it that is like my credit card so black it's invisible it's like in an absence of color yeah uh yeah it's uh my credit card so black the nasa just took a finally just took a photograph of it are we doing snaps right now is that what's happening i think this is treacherous territory we need to we need to oh yeah we need to get off the sudan i can do these jokes i know i know but look so maybe off color for you pardon the pun on brand for you oh yeah so baby baby there you go sorry yeah sorry i didn't mean to pimp you into it so you own nasa now congratulations so maybe i do goes to the ma to the mars um that to the mars so you'd rather go to mars but the people who gave you the these trillions of dollars expect you to go to the moon so what do i care who you owe them that i get you know what's gonna be even better for my birthday they're all expecting me to be on the moon i can do a selfie video say hey i'm on the moon what are we gonna do and then i turn around and reveal that it's actually the red planet mars yes wow and i'm halfway through to terraforming so how joey uh were there any sort of like perks that you had to give people on the gofundme any sort of uh uh rewards that you had to give people i didn't i didn't even start this thing right but i did notice that there were some uh perks on the site right so you have to give people like certain experiences or well there's if you if you contributed over 200 000 you'd get a signed t-shirt it's me it's me i've got uh i'm by my dj set i'm going what the so it's a photograph of you or a drawing it's an artist an artist hold on i'm gonna take a piss don't do that right here in the studio it's just a little tinkle don't worry about okay well that's all right that's why we have a toilet here but i i expect people to use it not during the show but during the breaks i got no shame all right things i've seen things i've done so for 200 000 and above you can get a t-shirt that has an artist rendering of you next to your dj equipment saying what the what the it's pretty wacky though i'm going huh okay so the face i'm making on this thing it's like yikes how many people pledged over 200 000 95 95 so these are a couple big donors though okay how much did they contribute uh we're gonna have to do some math on here but it was upwards of and it was in the billions it was so so a few people uh pledged a hundred billion and more yeah in order to make up that difference yeah to have 90 do 200 000 yeah we're gonna have to at least go with a bunch of people hundreds of i said at least 200 000 so so get to over 22 whatever the sure no i mean if 90 percent pledged at least 200 000 then it can be any amount that you like that's that's true okay so but there were a lot of big tickets are these like the one percent of the one percent are these the richest people in the world are fans of yours yeah i mean you could say that um but talking bezos we talk in yeah yeah but you know you gotta understand that i helped in through the early 2000s i helped a lot of families a lot of families really families in need families in need remember i would go to the house at night and sort of said do you son or daughter do they need do you know where they are oh i sort of recall that we have you know make sure that they were okay right and anyone with disabilities i would correct them you'll correct their disabilities in using what i've heard of like corrections in Scientology and this would be if they were physical disabilities i'd smash them back into place okay they were mental disabilities that just finally talked to these kids oh psychological i would bring them back okay wow so you're some sort of a a healer you have like healing uh energy on you i don't do the hippies dippy dippies right but i do do common psi hard science facts with just a force as well you would sort of like putting a square peg in a round hole you know you see these kids and they're going goo goo gaga and that they're too old to go goo goo guy all you gotta do is you gotta look them right in the eye and say what do you want use your words i see because that's that's a lot like acting you know every you all have wants when you're acting so what is your primary one i don't know it was never an actor baby there we go number three so you helped out a lot of families in need yes and so entire families entire communities cities towns countries they all pulled together and they said we gotta get this guy in the moon wow so my gift to them is saying hey on my birthday we're not on the moon today we're on mars and you think that'll be okay with them because i mean there's certain things about the moon that everyone likes the craters the dark side i think they're gonna be pretty pleased because i'll be the first man on the moon on the mars on the mars right and i'll be able to claim mars for america sudan for oh you do it for sudan i love sudan i think a lot of these people want you to claim it for america especially now well i guess you own nasa so it's nasa is now a sudanese it is a sudanese entity you are correct sir i don't know whether i should have encouraged you to buy that so wait is it gonna what does nasa stand for again it's uh north america space uh uh air force what is it it's something like that so is it just gonna be no it's gonna be nasa's north american space association sudan of sudan ness nasa okay nasa there you go okay perfect so so you're gonna take nasa up to mars you're gonna claim it for the sudan correct and everyone here who contributed to your gofundme page is now suddenly going to be i don't know i think they might be a little disappointed well you know right now we're accepting all kinds of um if you want to emigrate to sudan that's you can get it now do it now okay if you want to be part of the marsh the martian revolution i have a feeling this sounds different than how i initially sounded well i just your age we haven't seen you in four years it you know your voice becomes naturally more gravelly yeah something's different here you did say dues both times as i do is and i don't so if you want to go go to sudan you're taking all comers yeah sure getting ready for the martian revolution what does the martian revolution mean to you exactly meaning you're going to terraform and revolutionize mars and in case there are any martians there you're going to overtake them much as we did with the native americans when we came to america no no they're gonna be sitting there going beep bop boop boop beep i'm gonna say what do you want tell me what you need look them right in the eyes what do you think that is i mean they could want anything they well hey have you ever tried to talk to a martian i've never even encountered a martian and or maybe i haven't i just don't know well tell let me tell you scott i haven't either but if i ever do i'm gonna look them right in the eyes and ask them what do you want what if they don't have eyes what if they are not even humanoid in appearance what do you know that doesn't have eyes a flower no no no no no no that lives and breathes and walks uh wise guy i guess uh i mean there are certain human beings who name one person who doesn't have eyes well i'll tell you sammy davis jr famously only had one you know he had a glass one okay well i look into his regular eye and say what do you want okay but what if he had lost his other one in a different car accident then he would have no eyes that's so hypothetical now you're talking about a whole planet of creatures who've lost both eyes in two different car accidents maybe i don't know you know you spit a good yarn scott but i don't joey tortellini tells it how it is okay well good luck to you i mean when do you think you'll be making this trip my birthday's tomorrow it's tomorrow okay so you got some work to do just under the wire you need to start prepping this you need to call i mean you're the boss so uh you damn right you need to call up your subordinates and tell them to prep the space rocket prep the rockets get the biodome get polly shore get the whole crew we're going to mars you know i mean you spent some time in nasa uh in space camp are there i mean i think you're gonna have to travel through several wormholes in space in order to get there by tomorrow not you know we'll find them you're confident oh we'll find them scott those uh your poindexters over there at nasa i bet they know where all those things are ding dong human computers they're gonna we're gonna find them

i have tenure now wow you can't get fired can you imagine if they tried to fire me from the show hey listen we're going a different way with those tenure is such a racket isn't it what do you mean when you say a racket uh not long enough con tenure what is that there should be no i thought you meant 10 years as a racket oh no no that's a real unit of time yeah i agree i think at a certain point everyone should be forced to retire from whatever job they do yeah no health care no stability no status just kick them to the curb yeah at at latest 43 years old you have to retire from any job right it's a real logan's run kind of situation yep yeah just for and why 43 yeah because it's younger than i am and i just wanted to point it out yeah and you want to retire uh-huh what are you drinking from out of three and a half oh you're a big boy now i'm drinking something that wasn't uh a trend 10 years ago speaking of 10 years ago topo chico okay and i'm sponsored by them now oh you are congratulations thanks you're wearing a very festive hawaiian shirt and you're drinking topo chico with a topo chico t-shirt on underneath right yeah tropical breeze yeah you're on the topo chico street team i've noticed yeah oh i'm out i'm doing i'm a topo chico official topo chico hype man i've seen you out at cedarhurst and avocado for sure i'm out there on the corner with my sign just spreading the word man spreading the good word the sign doesn't say topo chico though that's what confuses me praise god you're just hoping that someone will connect the dots you're working on two things at once praising god and drinking some delicious water wow incredible spreading the good word are you sponsored by anyone chills not yet oh you gotta get sponsor i am looking for something to take on okay something to rep sure i will do it of course across all social media all social media platforms i'm looking for something where i'm doing 25 instagram posts okay including a one hour live okay and this is over the course of a year or a week 25 a week regarding one product 100 125 twitter posts a day a day wow i mean yeah do you have any idea what sect of product you want like is there any no i'm open to anything i don't have any moral qualms okay that's gonna be like a post every 12 minutes yeah but you know i think my fans would go with it and i think they're buyers and i think they're you have an incredible social media following i if i were a company i would capitalize on this right now how much does someone charge for something like this millions millions but you would do it oh god so if someone came to you with i'm okay let me just say three million dollars three million dollars you would literally do 125 twitter posts a day about their product now see this started off as just a facetious thing but yes i would you are committing right now to do actually doing three mil is kind of cheap for that kind of thing too considering what the kardashians get i mean it would basically cut my following in half i know it's a lot of money though it's a lot of but if you did it as a bit people would kind of enjoy it i think they would eventually mute you because everything's hashtag ad hashtag spawn i love hashtag spawn spawn con uh-huh i don't think i've seen spawn i've seen at hashtag spawn you've done hashtag ad i've done hashtag ad certainly but certainly i've never done hashtag ad why do you say it so certainly celebrity oh that's the difference that's right i mean you just assume sometimes i feel like we're on equal footing because of the other show we do right right no but no where we don't have any ads big little lines yeah people are way more interested in advertising with you as in just a celebrity than they are our actual show that we do yeah it's a topsy-turvy world and we're just living in it oh chelsea are you in big little eyes too keep on lying spiritually i i watch it i think about it i process it listen chelsea is all over that thing i root for some of the gals and i don't root for others of the gals i have no idea i've never seen it never will but always nice to meet a fan yeah oh god huge huge but uh what do you have in the pipeline you know what i talk about when i talk about the pipe you you i have some spicy thai food in there really is that what you're talking about yeah exactly i'm talking about your colon tell us about your colon adam well i've got uh two bowls of uh kashi cereal in the pipeline that i'm excited about so you let me went down easy i feel like it might shoot on out pretty easy too two bowls of kashi doesn't that sound scratchy yeah yeah that's how man just you're constantly like oh i gotta re-shift eating two heads of lettuce yeah i hope you chewed well adam you do the two bowls of kashi in the morning you do think thin bars the entire day two bowls of kashi you know what i haven't had a think thin bar in a long time since bono gave this one that's right i was like ah fuck this and the weird part is when you eat like that you shit power bars in the shape of power bars but then you can sell them especially if you're a celebrity hashtag ad if spawn the movie came out during the social media uh era do you think people would be confused it's like is this sponsored contact for the movie spawn and it would go spawn spelled the right way and then hashtag spawn s p o n boy hashtag spawn the movie because you know of course you gotta do both god i hope there's a reboot of it coming out soon so we can answer this question this is wonderful please please please please please please come on come on bring it on bring it on come on let's go let's go let's go let's go spawn both ways you did it spawn you did it well i guess there's nothing left for you guys to do but kiss uh

you i'm so scared of when that ends okay great what do yeah at what point i think it's 16 it's gonna be like hey do you mind yeah get your own apartment i'll take it oh you nasty fuck get off me do you want to record a drop here that you can just play for your children uh when they get older Chelsea here wait it's me to them yeah please cuddle with me hug me hold me let's nuzzle into one another

both uh just say listen i knew this was coming i'm not blindsided here we go you just play press play on a big boombox yeah on sonos so it goes throughout the house oh yeah yeah no matter what room by the way okay fucking killing it keep it real with the speakers in the house that's their that's their new slogan that's terrible no keep it real with those speakers in the house thank you thank you well i came up with it so thank you oh that is terrible and then some like people in the house are using it right hashtag and i do mean like speakers in the house right like speaker pelosi yeah yeah right they're also using the sonos tag and there's been a big war it's kind of oh yeah i've seen that yeah that's the biggest story in politics right now in washington it's gonna yeah what do you guys think about washington it's uh george w with those little soft waves for me it's like i had a theory about this a few episodes back for me it's like the circus was you know the traveling circus like the wringling brothers barnum and bailey i don't know showtime series yeah yeah exactly so they're they're out there traveling they land in washington and they're like we like it so much i think maybe all the clowns will just stay here yeah tell me about it you know what i mean yeah let's drop these uh this band of clowns off at the house of representatives and they'll take up permanent residence that's what i mean that's that's yeah you're building on what i was saying obviously but i i'll say this there are a bunch of clowns there in dc is that what you're saying is that what you're getting it kind of i mean i was sort of circling around it i think you said it maybe more clearly than i had really thought of it yeah any thoughts chelsea on dc sure it's a great comedy town but now i don't know i don't know i don't when's the last time you were back um god that's a great question probably five years five years five so is half the time this show has been on the air wow five it's all about your show and when i was there obama was president wow did you see him no but i felt him everywhere yeah i bet it was his town it's a real politics town i've noticed it is it's it's a it's a company like how you know hollywood is for celebrities holly weird uh stop that stop that right now i don't like that kind of talk on this show well no matter what you think about it's a company town right right yeah it's a one-trick pony it's kind of the same it's kind of the same thing but it seems to me like people really talk about politics there yeah yeah well also it's like you have the president there actually the white house is there i never looked at it that way yeah that's sort of maybe i guess why you know kind of flock they're politicians just because they have to do business they have to go to the white house knock on the door right hello is mr donald chappell right yeah is donnie there then he's like do you guys talk i think maybe the clown car made a made a pit stop at the white house too i don't know right maybe i don't know you know i had a theory about him that everyone calls him you know the commander in chief obviously but yeah i sometimes think he's the tweeter in chief oh i was gonna say the commander in cheese or the orange in chief i don't know you know we should get together and workshop these i just i can't get enough of these tweet storms how about commander and queef this is better this is better commander and queef okay this is a serious question because the debates are coming up next year in 2020 uh yeah whoever wins the nomination what if they just entire time called him the commander and queef that would be he would have no comeback and they're like excuse me sorry commander-in-chief they just do it every single time but yeah oh i'm so sorry i'm so sorry he talks he insults them or whatever and then they go well that's rich coming out of you the commander in queef and he would have no rejoinder he would say no commander-in-chief i'm so sorry but then like eight times during the debate they call him the commander in queef this is a good game plan the one time they wink to the camera after like i actually do know what i'm saying yeah that's fun um that's how you get the millennial vote exactly any mention of queefs you get like a hundred thousand millennials they come stampede they love queefs queefy is probably that's sometimes i wish i were a woman so i could queef i wish you're a woman too do you really yeah why so we could be best friends well like everything's hosted by guys yeah and white guys

leave bye so good to see those guys um some of the most special episodes uh we've ever done have been with those guys uh the the farts and procreation episodes one through four check those out if you haven't uh just pure silliness uh for an hour and a half apiece with our good friend harris whittles uh who uh unfortunately uh it would be my greatest wish to have him back on this show for this 10th anniversary but uh uh go check those out and catch the vinyl if you can catch the vinyl i don't even what does that i don't think that's ever been said about vinyl catch the vinyl um but um i tell you so many great old favorites dropping by that knock knock knock knock knock knock who's knocking after they already opened the door and came in motherfucker who do you think it is oh it's our old friend for barista breeze that's right scottaworker miss for breeze the breeze the beast from the east and ain't so nice you have to say it again that's right a catchphrase that still holds up 10 years in you motherfucking bitch how long did you exist before the show started as well i was born anew into this program and of course i was also in the program i am in recovery oh you are you're a friend of bill w i am a friend of bill i was what's his last name bill williamson oh okay great i've always wondered no one would tell me his full name was william williamson and then that shortened up to bill and then it became bill will suck your dick for a 40 and then he just became bill again once he got sober fabrice it's so good to see you we haven't seen you in so long if fabrice is uh he did craft service on the uh comedy bang bang television show that's right and that's his main job that's the main thing that i have had done for myself in many years of labors uh but since then you know obviously we have had our falling house that's true i haven't really wanted to talk about it necessarily because let's cut to that we're not cut into it i don't it's not a clip show it's a 10th anniversary clip show no sorry we have nothing to cut to okay yeah and besides i don't think that we were taping our falling out that was off mic that was personal mic that's right you would ask for heirloom baby carrots which i don't think is an unreasonable request necessarily i mean i do not like carrots that are different colored and orange i do not like a purple carrot so just because you don't like them personally doesn't mean you can't serve them it very much does actually because i believe one cannot serve food that one cannot stand behind that's why i will not stand behind that's why i never served a tilty table well it's fine because i cannot stand behind because you can't stand by yes i understand but what i'm trying to say is it's fine that you don't want to serve it but i don't understand why you suddenly pitched such a fit and walked off and uh we haven't spoken since well because scott is sometimes it's the note behind the note right okay so we had had our disagreements about this particular any note is i have displeasure in the way you're doing your job so unfortunately any note is going to come out as a little you know i unfortunately i didn't like the way the your work was going at that particular moment this is so typical scott ackerman to think that you were giving me the note okay because i was giving you the note i don't know how i was giving you the note that i did not like your reaction to me not wanting to get heirloom baby carris it was more than that it was it was you you tossed over the entire craft service table that's right you started throwing things at me that's right and it wasn't even craft service items you weren't taking personal items it was staplers it was three whole punches it was binders full of schedules and these are old scripts the yellow old scripts and these are all things that you could find on a set these are all things trust me yeah if you go back and listen to this and ask someone who's in show business they'll check off every single item and let's go back and listen let's cut back and let's listen to that okay we again we do not have clips unfortunately we cannot do this okay so and these are all things that you can find on a set as well as you know uh uh uh no those are all the things that's everything that i can think of that's on a set three whole punches you go to ncis new orleans you're gonna find a lot of three whole punches the goldenrod revisions oh that's right that is right that's classic set i love to get pissed on speaking of golden rod but i don't know what you mean revisions wow you you sometimes yeah you happening again yeah exactly it's happening again and let's cut to that let's get let's cut to me get it peed on i i don't think you want to cut to that even if we had tape of it i don't think you want that to happen okay well i could do sort of a michael winslow sort of a it's just gonna sound like yeah anyone could do this god damn it's either a snake impression or peeing it's salty this is salty that's not true none of this is true for barista barista's not like to get peed on no okay we want to make sure no one out there if there are young impressionable children out there uh getting peed on is not fun it's not hygienic yes unless unless you're a peafree unless you're a peafree and then it's great it's great fun it's great fun and also very healthy and it's been known to be said that pee is very good and actually very good for bacteria it's a very good exfoliant from what i understand from what i understand what scott understands from being pissed on you know is this now i i this is for the podcast right this is going on no this is not the television show we're not filming you currently this is the 10 years of the podcast the uh television show was five years uh that happened in the middle of those 10 thank you for understanding the timeline of your life so far yes and pre the podcast yes i nothing much happened oh scott that's not true that's not true i cannot even recall a time i remember working on mr show i was a craft services coordinator on mr show you were very nice to uh work on that show and i i recruited you from that show that's right and took you over to my own show i remember saying to bob i remember when we when they you when y'all were doing that mr show i said but but why you play a lawyer why you play a lawyer sometime and he said okay for briefs i'm listening i'm gonna he was intrigued no jokes i go no jokes maybe sometimes but no real jokes right then no big jokes just a lawyer just a lawyer exactly okay i go i saw something anyway i got to go i gotta go what so you almost created not only better call salt but breaking bad itself wow yeah amazing i spent many years in albacar key you did doing yes i was selling crystal meth okay i don't think that you want to say that on mike why it's too late like is the statute of limitations over about the crystal meth yeah yeah hey be a corpus christi whatever it's corpus christy they can't call me back on that they're gonna have to go down to corpus christy to find me there is that where you're spending most of your time right now family i got family and corpus christy your family i don't even know do they have two two similar names as well my friends are my family okay so you don't actually have family family patrice patrice oh he's my family well unfortunately he uh uh yes he passed he of course patrice o'neill my dearest friend of all oh right that's who i'm thinking yes that's who you're thinking of patrice o'neill who's patrice patrice patrice patrice uh is what i would call uh patrice o'neill in order for this to make sense for this whole run to make sense that's right i appreciate that you have my back like that yes of course always and forever sky you gave me the greatest opportunity of all i had you on the the uh podcast 10 years ago you were one of our very first guests and your career blew up and and this was before the tv show this was before the television show then there was the tv show for five years thank you for remembering my life now and then there was time after that yes exactly and so now we are where we are now we're at we are but uh this is still continuing we're just celebrating the 10 years this is us yeah are you working on this is us now i am the craft services coordinator no no spoilers for whoever's dead i know a lot of people die on that show and i i'll catch up with it someday i would not tell you if you paid me that's how much i love that crew that's how much i love being on that pro's milo milo's great is he dead oh milo is alive and well in real life i cannot speak to to whether he's still on the set i cannot speak to his character orc mandy moore i love mandy moore she is a sweet she is the sweetest person alive ryan adams x ryan adams not the sweetest person alive it turns would he come by the set allegedly he would he would ironically come by the set sterling k brown the sweetest man alive amazing dan fulkelman a wonderful boss the mbc brass i love them have we gone down the list of everything you know about this is us at this point mandy moore is old on that show sometimes really i have no idea i've not yes i don't follow all of your various projects unfortunately a lot of network television these days uh you know i'm more of a premium cable guy that's right you've heard of the cable guy right oh i love the cable i'm the premium cable guy you know i was the craft services coordinator on the cable guy really yeah what was that said like you have ben stiller you had a lot of personalities is that where you met bob originally that's where i met bob i said bob well i'm trying to remember i think mr show had been on air bob actually got me on bob got me on the cable that's how it went and jack black and jack black was on that movie so many great people leslie man that's where jut was on that movie jut appetite did you hook those guys up somehow i said hey jut why don't you get together with this leslie man and just said okay and then i said don't have to tell me twice don't and i didn't and i refused to i said that the advice so nice i had to give it once so and then and then i did that and i said to jim carrey i said you know you got the cable you got you got ace ventura you got this by the way cable ace awards that's right i worked on the cable aisles i was the services coordinator on the cable aisles awards were those for commercials or those were for cable programs cable that was the cleo wars was was for the commercials right do they still give those out oh my god i did the craft services coordinator on the cleo awards and i remember when they had that where's the beef lady from the wendy's commercial oh really did they give her a lifetime achievement award hey hey you old bitch the beast right here and i had a bun on my i had my dick in a bun oh no how did you take that all the way down the throat yeah we had fun that was a different time in show business it was a different time you could you could have you could harass people right and you just get away with it and now things have changed things have changed over the even the past 10 years i mean just think about the things that we used to do on set that i witness you do well i don't think we need to talk about that yeah no and you don't have any tape to that effect let's cut to some of that tape again we do not have any of that tape i just think that things have changed i mean you know some of our old friends are no longer with us of course i was the craft service coordinator on the charlie rosho oh you were really the guy who famously uh took he swam naked i believe he swam naked i said hey charlie because originally he was going to do this show in a big fluorescent room with lots of or ideas and i was like hey charlie black room nobody there then he said okay why now why would that be an idea like you could be in your robe and take out your your people you can take out your people are you saying people or people i mean it's in the eye of the beholder uh you know so i worked on that show let's see i worked on the chew with mario batali oh okay i recall that show and i was like i gotta get out of here i can't work craft services on a show that's about food because nobody wants to eat that food yeah exactly they're eating there on the set they're eating that on camera and that was the only problem with mario batali that was the only problem mario batali except that his he had a crack wrangler he had he had some guy bringing him new orange crocs every day and then he had new ones every day new crocs you can afford it i mean walk a mile in those shoes no thank you no thank you stinky and then also he had that vest he had those fleece vests oh right yeah that was your only problem with him that was my big issue with him was his clothing a tire um and then back to the cable guy though i remember that movie was originally very funny oh yeah from what they say the original cut was very funny they made a little darker and then i said no no no no no no make it serious take away the jokes nobody was you yeah i said no no no no no nobody wants to see jim carrey making jokes so you're serious your ideas uh are scattershot at best i mean you had breaking bad very successful and then the cable guy this killing him will claim okay in court in court and and elsewhere and elsewhere that he came and other and on james corden wherever you want that he came up with that show himself you know and i'm like come on man come on man i go i guess i'm you know he and i used to not we used to play mini golf together you did miniature golf yeah me and miss kelly will play mini golf is that out in albert gherky where he spent so much time with crystal meth yeah yeah and i remember playing with him i go hey hey hey what about the dad from alcolm in the middle but he got cancer so you independently told bobbie should play a lawyer saw something yeah and then also independently told vince gilligan that the dad from alcolm in the middle should get cancer that's right did you think did you say he should just get cancer or you should play someone who had cancer i mean in a fit of rage i said that i said that brian cranson should get cancer what did brian cranson ever do to the likes of you he's such a good sport he took it in stride oh this was to his face this was to his face was this on the malcolm in the middle set this was i was a craft services coordinator on malcolm in it oh okay how are those kids oh they were great they were wonderful i remember telling frank you know i said get out of act and get into formula one racing and so he said you know what fabrice that's not a bad idea so some of your ideas should be taken with a grain of salt because they haven't worked out so well as i like to say everything should be taken with a grain of salt because everything tastes better a little bit salty that's right that's why you have just a just a mound of it on the uh craft service table anytime that you everybody there yeah that's what it is is salt oh is that salt it's cocaine why have i not been taking the cocaine because it i don't know scott but that cocaine makes you feel elegant and powerful i will say i salted all of my food every single day when i was doing the comedy bang bang television that's why you were taught so fast on those intros that's what it was also just why waste time on an intro i agree that's i know i always felt like i was giving you that no scott you know get through the intro get through those intros get through those intros do you miss being all set in that one room all day long for 15 hours a day just plowing through pages not really maybe i miss being on television but sure but hey look i was on that tv program as well yeah doing 30 pages a day doing 30 pages a day or one improvised spoken word poem either way either way it's a hard hard life it was exhausting well you're one of our oldest friends fabrice i mean we haven't seen the likes of you uh in in in quite a bit you know and i wondered i guess it was you know we were mad at each other we had our falling outs anything more than that is well i have been doing other things of recent you have other hobbies or professions right i've been dabbling in all types of things i've been advising people advising people i don't know what that means it's a different time so okay just even the idea of me of me doing fabrice fabrice i don't know if it's even acceptable anymore it's so hard to tell it's so hard to tell i don't know i mean you're a wonder uh a wonderful character uh i mean person you have wonderful characteristics i guess is what i meant to say right and uh characteristics that can be found in many a person exactly and very true to life exactly and uh and i think if you trace of trace my representation on this show you might feel a difference in the kind of things that i talk about i don't know what you mean how do you what exactly are you talking about here i mean i think 10 years ago on this show i was a cruel beast uh and now i'm all about positivity that's right fabrice fabrice i think your brand should be positivity that's right it's fabrice it's positivity it's uplifting it's acceptance it's love exactly scott how are you gonna put that into practice i'm gonna open a gun range i don't see the connection if everybody carries a gun everyone feels safer exactly i'm a spokesperson for the nra now okay i don't know that this is the direction that you should be going to no that's right i gotta jingle for the nra now okay what is it hey and all right join us and shoot other people with your gun and save everybody and all right and all right and all right hey nra i love the little tag at the end it's almost like a post-credit scene in a marvel movie that's right i love those marvel movies what do you love about them you know avengers endgame now has been out for three days or so right made a billion dollars at the box office so exciting uh oh yeah well you know i've worked on all of those marvel movies every single one from iron man to avengers endgame and man with the wasp and man with the wasp and all of them up to this endgame avengers endgame and it was a tearful production for us to be a part of really i don't know why i mean they say that spending a lot of time in one green room yeah very uh no it brought us all together and to watch all of those male actors bonding with each other the camaraderie of movie stars they all gotta get very buff for those they all lift waste for one for like one 15 second scene when they take their shirt off yeah and other female characters look at them like oh look at that and oh those are my favorite days you know what i mean because i don't know because one of them would come by for water or something i need some water i go uh uh uh you're not allowed water today we gotta dehydrate you make those veins pop so it's your favorite day just simply because you don't have to serve them the water i don't have to serve that pole rub motherfucker a drip drop of water pauls oh he's a friend of the show he's been on this program a friend of the show but he's not a friend of febreeze febreeze motherfucker shoots elephant come into his face that's why he looks so young that's how he looks so young that question never came up on this show when he was on it next time you see next time you see do i just like make some sort of like uh maybe a sound effect to like yeah that's a horse yeah no but elephants like horses so he'll get all this side no it's true people don't know that wow you don't know that people don't know elephants like horses or that he injects elephant come into his face both i think but so on the days that's what i understand about those movies and that's why i had to quit is i said you know they got to get all jacked up they don't drink water so those things pop i go y'all got fucking everybody flying through the sky this is all this cgi the body i could be in these movies you could sky you know what i mean like i don't have straight up oh thank you i mean i was hoping you would notice if you want i'll put in a word could you with whom uh kevin fighting really you're going all the way to the top okay hold on take that shot for me you know what i already spoke to him let's cut to that tape okay we don't have i doubt that you already spoke to him because it's the first time we're talking about marvel movies i know it's true though you're an inverter at liar what's that you're a liar i am a liar liar i worked on that movie too liar liar wow you had a really uh big streak with jim carrey i had a run with jim yeah when did the run end with jim after eternal after truman show oh okay i got on that movie i go this is depressing this motherfucker you know kind of god doesn't know where the sky is it's a wall bomber i gotta get out you know what i mean i really so you you had not read the script previous to that just you go i never i never read a single script i never guess you don't have to when you're a craft service because your work doesn't change you know depending on the snacks i provide depend on what's happening on set that day really if you don't read the script then how are you able to predict i just vibe it out you know what i mean for example adventures end game which we have all seen sure you know i thought and i i think if you haven't seen it yet i don't think i'm spoiling anything don't spoil anything for avengers end game but the gang gets back together okay good yeah the gang's back together that's safe to say i'm spoiling anything it's right there on the post we gotta get the game back together so that purple josh brolin don't fuck everything up right yeah is that right with the uh the ball sack on his chin yes exactly yeah deez nuts right on well but that's exactly perfect is that i will when he's on set i get balsamic vinegar for everything so that he can put his balls purple it's got ball sack you know it's all that's and that's the kind of thing i'm always thinking about yeah you're incredible at your work oh gosh scott you know what i want to say is that i think you're spectacular at what you do as well what is it that you think i do i think that you sit here that's the main thing because i sit here and you can you talk to these people these personalities wonderful personalities you are the glue scott thank you so much you are the glue you are the you are the massacred horse you are the of the podcast you are you are without your horse corpse i'm like turning into glue i'm like those horses that died on the the tv show luck exactly which you worked on as well i worked on that show did you have anything to do with the horses dying i broke a couple of those horses ankles how playing basketball with them oh no cross them over i cross over i go i cross them over oh the horse fell down it was on youtube it was on instagram motherfucking horse looked like a motherfucking idiot that reminds me of one of my favorite basketball movies of recent times uncle drew uncle drew yeah i worked on uncle drew you worked on uncle drew that's right what's the cast like there it was fun shakil o'neill that dude's fun yeah uh when he eats like a regular sandwich it looks like a small thing it's funny isn't it it's funny you know he should always eat some giant sized things when he's drinking a normal water it looks like a tiny water yeah when he's drinking a tiny water oh my god when he's drinking a tiny water you can't even see it you're like how's that guy eating a toenail he looks like he's drinking a toenail it's so small in his hand wow what a fun set it was such a fun time what about our friend nick kroll have did you ever uh i've worked with nick nick is you know it's nick's difficult with craft services now because he loves chocolates and sweets so much oh yeah but he doesn't want to eat them because he's on camera sometimes he's in the prime of his career and it's very tough but he can't stop eating that dark chocolate and peanut butter pretzels he loves it he loves it i don't think you should be giving away his secrets i mean he probably wouldn't want anyone to know these guys no he might think it makes him more relatable that he can't stop eating his cool rich chorinos oh but he'll eat some you know what they'll do is i'm doing carousel homies i go okay nick okay nick remember you want to be if you want to be a star you want to be a star you've had this dream ever since you were young ever since you were a little boy you wanted to be an actor and to be on camera you have to have one of those avengers bodies or else first somehow you can't get work right because that's why you're on that's why you're on camera because you're you have a nice body no motherfucker i wish that they would just shoot us from the from the the top of the head to the chin yeah from because that's all anyone that's all anyone cares about nick nick will always recreates mid forehead to just below the mouth right don't want to see a hairline don't want to see a double chin i'm not sure he would want that nose involved either like maybe just a black box in the side of the screen you notice when nick is acting he's got always like an index card in front of that nose so it's just eyes and lips eyes and lips that's all he wants the nick curl story eyes and lives and lips that's all he wants and you know what i mean you know it works it work it works for him it works for him yep i'll tell you what doesn't work for him what's that all those candy bars i can relate i can relate oh but it's you know and i try to tell him i said nick it's okay you eat what you want you feel good about yourself he goes but i'm so tired yeah i eat this sugar i get so tired i want to get hypnotized that's the thing that uh you know we starve ourselves to be on camera and then uh uh you know you expect people when they watch us they should just think this person is starving the entire that's the entire movie that's what they want to feel that you have suffered for your oar and the truth is nobody cares nobody cares no one cares look we're all gonna look you you you and i would talk about philosophy a lot honey backstage we all gonna burn up do you mean because of the environment or do you mean in hell oh both so wait we burn up here and then we go to hell and we get again we get charred to a crisp this is a double burn that's a double burn i hate it hot so yeah at least let me freeze to death here so that my first few minutes in hell i'm just falling out no that's worse because you know when you've been out in the cold and then you come back in and your woman warm up and then your toes hurt yeah that's eternity right i guess you're right yeah i would prefer just to be charred to a crisp oh to be charred to a crisp and then spread with a little balsamic lace eat that up that's nice that's a good food it is a really good food yeah well fabrice i miss you god it's nice to be back in here we should figure out whether you're allowed to come back or not what do we think everybody out there in the world let's vote it's fabrice fabrice allowed to continue is it no longer an acceptable thing to do can fabrice exist let us know or is it a different time i don't know i honestly i am good either way well fabrice if this is the last time i see you scott i want you to know what a goddamn pleasure has been to been on this podcast pleasure has been all mine 10 years 10 years wow you were you're one of our oldest friends i really appreciate you making the time back then and now and everything in between i know that if i ever call you fabrice you're there uh and and i really appreciate that in 10 minutes in a toyota salica that's right and i and my elantra and here we are behind you and here we find ourselves today and in the future when the earth has frozen over and then burnt to a crisp and then i hope i hope to hell i hope that we get to do this podcast again in hell i do i will see you in hell buddy it's so great to see you here and i'll see you in hell great should we do before we go would shall we do one should i do one improvise i would love that shall we do one improvised spoken word poem i would love that do you need a subject matter sure okay okay uh let me think of a catchphrase or not a catchphrase whatever you want let me think of a suggestion for you okay uh pure l okay oh pure l it is pure hell to think about a world without the comedy bang bang podcast but that is our cast that did my mic just go off or did you hear that no i heard it all i heard it all from beginning to and from big to small from a one-year podcast to a 10-year podcast to a a life cast of loss and love and learning and and casting out the iron sheik from this world as he has died but before he did he tweeted at all of us but it was not him instead his nephew who was his manager and this might seem like a tangent to you i was just getting information all about trivia but to me it is so much more purel we're gonna start it again from the top ready oh purel oh purel it is pure hell to think about a world without the comedy bang bang podcast to wash my hands of the bacteria that is my mysterious of hiding behind the microphone for these many years and in front of the camera for these many years my ears have always been to the ground for the next great town hall of this show which has given so many a voice in this crazy world that is not always noise, but can be hear always, most importantly, in my heart, that is my art, that is this cast, that is my blast, that is the comedy blast, bang, bang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang, blang.

That isn't the end, but just the beginning of a time when we could be together, a decade long, a foot long, hot dog that when Shaq East, it looks like a regular dog.

But when I think about 10 years of this oort, I think about my hort, and I think about all the great comedy that has come from this, and the big bang of the bang, bang, of Galecki, of Sheldon, of Aukerman, of everybody coming together, the two greatest things in comedy in the last decade coming, Come on.

between the big bang and comedy bang, bang, the two most important voices in comedy in the last decade, comedy bang, bang, 10 years in but not done, but the big bang theory done like a motherfucker, and I think we're all happier that we still got this show in our hearts and in our souls, and when I think about Purell, I think about washing my hands, not of these memories, but of those nasty little bacterias that give you calls.

Purell.

Yes.

Wow, amazing.

And you can edit that down to the best parts.

Amazing.

Fabrice, Fabrice, that means so much to me.

A lot of the sentiments contained within, not everything, of course, because you did go off on a few tangents, but that means so much to me.

I really appreciate it.

We appreciate you.

Thank you.

Thank God.

You believe in God?

Oh, hell yeah.

Then why are we all going to hell?

Because Frankie Muni said we are.

Fabrice, so great to see you.

Thank you so much for dropping by.

Great to see you, Scott.

I'll see you soon, I hope.

Well, we'll let we'll let the listeners decide.

You decide, audience.

All right. Take care.

Bye bye.

All right.

We need to go to a break.

Well, we still have plenty of shows still to go.

I think we're probably six hours deep at this particular point in time.

So we'll see you for another four hours, but we'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang after this.

Comedy Bang Bang, we are back.

Very special 10th anniversary, 10 hour podcast, the world's longest podcast.

Never thought that I would achieve something like this, but I think the world's longest podcast is actually I'm more proud of that than the 10 year anniversary.

I think. Wow, I really did something.

This is incredible.

And we're hearing from some of our favorite guests, old and new.

So many great people have dropped by over the show, and we hope that trend continues because the.

Hello.

Who's this? My darling Lovelace.

Oh, my goodness. Is this Martin Sheffield Lickley?

Martin Sheffield Lickley.

The nineteen hundred and eighty singer.

That's it, Scott. How are you?

I'm doing wonderful.

Thank you. Happy anniversary.

Thank you so much.

It means the world to me that you remembered.

I'm so happy to be here.

Thank you for having me.

Of course. I mean, it's my anniversary.

Is it an anniversary of yours at all?

Well, you know, every day seems to be some type of anniversary for.

And is an anniversary always happy?

I guess not. That's why they say happy anniversary instead of just wishing you an anniversary.

A lot of my days are devastating anniversary.

Yes. For those of you who don't know, Martin Sheffield Lickley, a lot of people who are in your orbit have passed away.

Yes. Yes. My wife from emphysema.

No, my son was from emphysema.

Yes. Because he saw the little boy smoking Siggy's video on YouTube.

And it inspired him.

It inspired him to smoke.

And he passed away from emphysema.

My wife passed away.

My postman passed away from tragically mailing himself to the bottom of the ocean.

Right. So a lot of people have have died on days of the year.

Is today one of them?

Yes. It's a sad anniversary.

I actually today was the day that my hairdresser passed away.

I wondered you have a bit of a bed head kind of situation.

I do. I do. I mean, I always do.

Well, I wouldn't say what I sleep in is called a bed.

Oh, wait. Where do you sleep?

I would say it's a old rug in the back of a UPS store head.

Well, that's not a good situation for you.

I'm currently in between places.

Yes, certainly.

So where were you coming from and where do you think you're going to?

Well, I was coming from an apartment and hopefully I'm going to another apartment.

But I do have I am.

Why don't you call them flats?

Why don't I?

I should. But I'm trying to, you know, be more American.

Oh, certainly. Yes.

Well, I'm sorry to hear about your hairdresser.

That was a year ago or?

Yes, that was a year ago today.

Yes. Good. Yeah.

How did your hairdresser die?

Well, he cut his own neck open.

Oh, no. Yes. With his own tools.

Yes. Oh, dear.

Yeah. It was it was devastating.

Yes. You know, a lot of my life is is like those movies, you know, where people like fly off of a roller coaster.

I don't know that I've seen that movie.

Is that like the movie?

They crash into the back of a truck.

It's tragedy.

It's I don't think people define movies by one scene in them.

No, but remember, they they they fly off a roller coaster.

Oh, they're just repeating the same things that you said before.

They chop their head off.

Oh, wait. Final destination.

Oh, yes. OK.

It's stuff like that.

But, you know, I mean, if you've been following my career, you know that I recently went, oh, you have not.

Well, you know, it's I've talked to you.

I got off the Gram.

Oh, you did.

So people sometimes they have trouble keeping up with what I'm doing.

I just felt like I was always on my phone.

Sure. I wasn't following you in the first place.

So that has no effect.

Well, you know, I but if you haven't been following me, if you have, you know, I recently set out on my own and I'm a solo artist.

Yes. You were a singer.

You trafficked in the genre New Wave.

New Wave. Yes. New Wave was my genre.

I was in a band called Two Plus Two Equals Love.

Ah, yes. And so I had some creative differences with my bandmates.

So I split with them.

But I've been having a lot of recent success in my solo songs of pain and hardship that guess what?

Hollywood came a knocking.

What? Yes. Came a knocking to your UPS store?

Well, I had a door that time.

OK. But yes, Hollywood came a knocking.

And now I am an in demand film composer.

Film composer? My goodness.

Yes, I know. I know.

What films?

Well, you know, I've I've been working on a couple of different films.

The first song that I'll be performing today is you're performing a song.

Oh, yes, I am.

Why do you think I'm here?

I don't wish me a happy anniversary.

Yes, of course. But I have to sing.

Oh, OK. Every time I love to hear you sing.

Thank you. Thank you.

You know, every time I do go to someone else's event that is about them, I make it about me. Of course.

But yeah, the first song I'm going to be performing today is an is from an upcoming Martin Scorsese crime drama.

Oh, my goodness. Yes, that's amazing.

Yeah. And a song in something like that.

It's unbelievable.

I mean, he is an awesome, awesome director.

And there's a scene to tell me.

Well, I mean, you've seen one of these movies.

I feel like you're always giving me you're digging your heels in on whether you like Martin or not.

Well, you know, I was confused for a while.

I thought it was Martin Lawrence.

No, no. I was like, he directed Goodfellas?

No, no, no, no. OK.

But yeah, this is a scene when aged crime boss played by Robert De Niro, of course, is beaten with casting.

I know he's really is going back to the De Niro well.

He's beaten to an inch of his life by his own meth addicted son.

And his son, he's begging his son to stop.

He's begging his son to stop.

He's begging it. He's pleading. He's crying.

And then imagine this song playing over the top of that scene. Hit it.

I fell in love with love, I proposed to love and then love said yes.

So I got married to love.

We got married on Valentine's Day.

The best man was a heart and the priest assented candle.

And the venue was a best western in Modesto.

A heart with legs was the father of the bride.

When the mama glass of champagne saw my wife, she cried.

I had sex with love and love did not come.

I came real hot and I fell asleep.

Love begged me to get her off.

I ignored love's pleas and I pretended to sleep because the female orgasm baffles me.

I ruined our wedding night. It made my wife weep.

I have never made a woman come.

Thank you. Oh, thank you.

An abrupt ending. That was a real quick ending.

I guess it's just a hard cut to the next scene.

Yeah, I mean, a lot of times when my when I say thank you, my band falls off their instruments because it's so abrupt.

They fall off their instruments.

Well, you know, they're writing them, some sort of contraption like a Dick Van Dyke and Mary Poppins type thing.

Well, you know, occasionally they get carried away.

You know, people play the guitar with their teeth.

Sure. Oh, of course.

Occasionally my bassist will ride his bass around like a broom.

Like a tricycle. Oh, like a broom.

Like a witch. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

OK. But yeah, so that's that's going to be over the gritty crime drama.

Over the pleading of Robert De Niro.

Yes. Well, you know, when I played that song for Mr.

Corsa- Scorsese, did you call him Corsa-scorsese when you first met him?

Well, that was a problem.

I was I did when I did.

You think he was Dan Cortese?

I think I did.

Well, I kept being like at one point I called him Caduce.

Oh, no.

But yeah, when I played that song for Mr.

Scorsese, he screamed something at me about being fired, and then I never saw him again.

I don't know that this song is going to wind up in the movie.

I don't know, Scott.

I mean, I did approach him when he was filming his new Hollywood movie.

Oh, OK. He has a Hollywood movie.

Yeah, you know, I don't.

It's coming out with DiCaprio.

I don't read the trades, so I angled the trades.

Oh, well, anyway, it's going to be huge.

OK, good. But yeah, I sort of was hovering around the set of that movie.

People asking me to leave.

Hmm. So you don't want Burger King.

You brought Burger King.

Well, yeah. To get onto the set to gain access.

Up to a set without a gift.

I've never heard that tradition in Hollywood.

Oh, yeah. You never show up to a set without a gift. OK.

So you're working on another film?

Yes. Yes, I'm I'm actually working on a new drama film.

A new a newer than this one.

Newer than this one. Yeah, this it's that one's in post.

Oh, this one is just the idea in free.

Yeah. OK. It's just free.

Yeah. The glint in someone's eyes.

Yeah. And this this film is sure to not be ignored this Oscar season.

Oh, and it's it hasn't even started filming.

And yet this Oscar season, it's going to it's not going to ignore it.

It's going to happen.

It won't be eligible for awards, but they're not going to ignore it. Sure.

They're going to be devastated because they're like, oh, we just missed this one.

OK. I mean, it stars Michael Shannon as a doctor at an assisted suicide facility.

And he falls in love with one of his patients, played by Amy Adams.

Oh, great cast.

I know a duo of the duo.

My song plays from Man of Steel, from Man of Steel, General Zod and Lois Lane themselves.

Yeah, they're back together.

They're back together. Everyone's wanted to see them.

They people were like those to take those two and make something.

And my song plays over the final scene of the movie where he must euthanize the love of his life.

Spoiler, I know.

And is she playing the love of his life or are they not together?

No, she's playing the love of his life.

Yeah. And to help her escape her pain of her terminal illness, he's going to kill her.

So imagine having to take the life of the most special person as this song plays.

I've enlisted in the army of love.

My drill sergeant was a lips and my helmet was a hug.

Our camouflage is a mixture of pink and red.

Instead of rations, we eat romantic bread.

We are invading a country that doesn't know what love is.

They've never known what love is.

No, no. We're going to spray their civilians with love bullets.

They're real bullets.

We marched on the battlefield in the shape of a heart.

But I tripped and shot a sergeant right in the face.

I got a dishonorable discharge from the army of love.

And now I also have love PTSD.

Thank you. Thank you.

Wow. Yes. That's playing over.

Yes, she's the she's slipping away.

Her heart monitor is...

Doooot.

Slower.

Doooot.

Yeah, I can imagine how slow it gets.

Sure. Tell it to continue.

Yes. Thank you.

It's a long beat.

Why is the the song not slow like the heart monitor?

It seems very upbeat.

Well, I was like, I saw the scene and I was like, this is a little slow.

OK, so you said, let's pick it up a little bit.

Yeah. Wow.

And yeah, I mean, I submitted that song to the director six months ago and I have not been paid or acknowledged since.

So you were acknowledged originally, though?

I was acknowledged.

Well, I brought Burger King.

I brought Burger King to the editing bank.

Why are they editing?

They haven't even started shooting.

They're getting it warmed up.

OK, turning on, turning everything on.

Yeah. OK.

When they get the footage, it's got to happen fast for the Oscars.

Sure. Of course.

Wow. Yeah.

Any other films in the pipeline?

Well, yes, I actually do.

I have the next song is from a prestigious HBO miniseries from David Simon who brought you The Wire.

The Wire, of course. Yes.

Homicide. Yes.

And Homicide about the life of one of Jesus's followers.

OK. God, he had 12 as far as I can think of, along with Mary Magdalene.

Yes, Mary Magdalene.

So about Makers doesn't.

Oh, really? It's about Mary Magdalene herself.

Well, anyone can do one about the disciples.

Sure. Peter, John, John, Judas, Judas.

Yeah, those are the top three.

Three. I bet there was a cliff.

Cliff.

But yeah, this song plays over a scene where Mary watches Jesus, who some suspect was her lover.

Sure. Brutally crucified on the cross.

She's watching him being brutally crucified. Not peacefully, not easily crucified.

Brutally crucified.

This must be a powerful scene.

It's it's powerful.

It's it's devastating.

And then this song plays.

Let me tell you about a special place, a place called Love City.

Love City is a town where everyone is in love.

Instead of roads, we drive on candy hots.

Instead of fire hydrants, we have doves.

The dog catcher is a poem and the comptroller is lingerie.

The police chief is a back massage and the mayor is me.

I've been elected the mayor of Love City.

Everyone voted by wiping their hands on his and hers towels. My first order as mayor is making everyone fall in love.

My second order as mayor is criminalizing the homeless.

Thank you.

Wow. That's a twist ending.

Wow. It's a metaphor, but it's a metaphor.

The criminalization?

Yeah, it's a metaphor, but they're a little yucky.

OK, come on. I mean, you're homeless.

I am not a homeless person criminalized myself.

I'm out looking for a job.

It's a metaphor, Scott. It's a metaphor.

But yes, thank you. Thank you.

I did not give you any sort of acknowledgement.

But when the Catholic Church watched the miniseries, they called for my execution.

Oh, no. OK.

That's the first time they've done that for anybody.

Yeah. No, I've heard of a fatwa, but no, yeah.

They want me dead.

Wow. Yeah. I'm so sorry.

I know I cannot walk by a rector.

Well, gosh, they're incredible.

I know. I know.

But this has been leading to a lot of a lot of new work.

Yeah. Do you have something?

I have a final song from a new project.

Yes. So many projects that you may not end up with.

I've got so many projects from people that I knew for a minute and now they won't talk to me.

Right. But this final project, I've been asked to be the composer and narrator.

Wow. Yeah.

And it's a new documentary documentary series about how global warming is devastating our planet.

Wow. This is an important issue.

So it couldn't be more important right now.

Incredible.

I mean, new documentary.

Wow. I mean, you've heard of Planet Earth.

I you've heard of Earth Time on Netflix.

What is the new I guess I haven't heard of that one.

But this one is called The Big Blue Marble.

We call home is Earth.

And wow, look at it.

Spin go round.

Wow. OK, that's the incredible title.

It's a good one.

I just plays over the credits or no, I'm the narrow rate.

You're the narrator.

Yeah. So imagine this scene.

You're washing the ice caps, melting at alarming rates, and endangered species animals are clinging to their life.

Our planet is dying.

We mistreated it.

And now our entire species will die with it.

Our pursuit of profit above all else has resulted in the decimation of our only home, Earth.

As soon as 2030, the planet will be hit by inconceivable food shortages.

Mass coral reef destruction and rising sea levels will destroy entire cities like the one you currently live in.

All aboard the plane of love.

We're going full air ahead.

Swoosh swoosh.

The overhead compartments are full of broken hearts.

And the pilot is a kiss.

Plane of love full of tender hugs.

I must pilot it straight to the airport of love.

There are Hudson News and Sbarro's there.

But I'm too heartbroken to buy snacks from them today.

It's the plane. It's the plane.

The plane of love.

I steer the wheel.

The plane's wheel.

The plane of love.

Look out for birds.

They're shaped like birds on the plane of love.

I can't make women come.

Thank you. Thank you.

Bringing it all back to the original song.

Oh, my goodness.

Martin, I good luck with all of these endeavors.

I mean, it's been such an honor performing here for you, Scott, for your anniversary.

It's our honor to have you.

It's such a nice change because I usually perform to my own reflection outside of a Rite Aid in a puddle.

You didn't bring Burger King, as far as I know, but.

Well, I don't know. Did I?

No, I didn't know.

OK, well, Martin, thank you so much for coming.

Thank you for having me.

OK, we'll see you next time. Bye bye.

Oh, wow.

Martin Sheffield, Lickley, one of I tell you what a sensation he's been.

And he seems to write new songs every single time he comes in here.

Incredible, incredible.

I am overwhelmed with emotion here.

This is what a showing from from some of our favorite guests here.

And Scott, my heavens, it's Weird Al Yankovic.

How are you, man?

I'm really, really good. It's so good to see you.

I was just strolling by and I felt like there was something happening here, like an actual happening happening here.

Your Yankovic sense started tingling, tingling.

What part of your body tingles when that's that sense goes off?

Fwish, fwish.

It could not be a comedy bang bang anniversary without you here.

You're such an important part of the family.

You were on, I believe, a very early episode number six or number eight.

Well, here's the thing. I feel like you've always kept me in your heart.

So I feel like I was really there from the very first episode.

That is true.

Now, a lot of times I'll walk into the studio and you're just sitting there in the corner. Yeah.

Unresponsive as well.

That doesn't really count, though.

Yeah, but you've been here technically.

And not only were you on a very early episode and several episodes since, but you were on the comedy bang bang television show as my co-host and bandleader for a season.

Was I Kid Cudi?

Yeah, you were during the Kid Cudi years.

Oh yeah, I remember that now.

You just headlined Coachella, I believe.

Oh, was it fun?

It was super fun.

Speaking of Coachella, you should be on that at some point.

What am I thinking?

What are you doing?

Why am I not headlining Coachella?

It's so crazy. Like, let me manage your career.

It's about time Scott.

I know we had to all fire our agents.

Do I have to ask formally?

Well, we need a binding agreement here.

Otherwise, I'm afraid that you're going to, you know, cut me out of those profits somehow.

We need to do the spit handshake?

Yeah, that's what I mean by binding agreement.

So we need to spit on each other's faces and then shake hands.

Yeah, so here we go.

Oh, God.

That was kind of pointless.

I don't know.

Oh, that was the sound of our up and down shake.

A lot of wind moving there.

Al, what do you remember about the very first time you ever did the show?

As far as I am recalling, I believe it was the first time we ever met.

Was it? In fact, I do believe it was.

That was back when was Joe Escalante engineering back?

Yes, engineer Joe was it was back.

Engineer Joe. Yeah, that was live on a indie 103.

Indie 103. Yes, indeed.

Back in back in the days. Back in the day.

They don't even have broadcasting back.

And we just had to talk really loudly. Right.

It seems like that.

Yeah. Do you?

I as I recall, we did a was it a one on one interview?

It might have been. It could have been.

Those were back in the days when we didn't realize what a podcast was.

We didn't even know at the time, even though it was a podcast.

And I had several weird how questions at the ready.

Things that I'd always wanted to ask.

You were prepared, which is something you never do now.

Why bother at this point?

And then just amazing how our friendship has blossomed.

And you and I have grown closer and closer and closer.

Then there was a little time where we were like, too close, too much, too much.

Back up. And that conjoined twins thing was not a terrible idea.

Bad idea to do plastic surgery to actually attach us.

Yes. Usually it's the other way. Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, that was a tough three years, but we had a good two for one deal.

So we got the conjoining and the unconjoining. So that's true.

We actually made money on the deal.

That is the thing that they don't tell you about now is to actually walk out of plastic surgery, scam the plastic surgeon that way.

I'm 50 grand richer. Yeah, this is crazy.

I'm going to Vegas. Yeah. And then we lost it all in Vegas.

Yeah.

And then we were like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, black always been on black.

Yeah, exactly. As Wesley Snipes once cautioned America.

But and now we're the best of friends.

Would you say that? I would say that even though we are two separate entities now, I feel like in our hearts, we are still conjoined.

I loved when we shared nutrients between that little.

Wasn't that nice? That that flesh sac that attached.

That was my favorite flesh sac.

Oh, yeah. I mean, look, I'm a little partial to a flesh sac.

That I don't want to name. Oh, you know what I mean?

How pancreas are. I have my pancreas.

Did you know that the skin is the largest organ on the body?

I thought the Wurlitzer was. That's right. Of course.

Al, do you have what's going on with you?

I mean, you know, I know we're we're best friends, but I feel like I haven't seen you since the last time you did the show.

Oh, I don't want to once again plug my my big summer tour, the strings attached.

That's great. You don't want to do that.

All right. So let's move on to other things.

Uh, look, I have some ideas for your career.

Do you? You know, as your perhaps manager, perhaps.

Well, spit manager.

I think that first of all, this touring stuff, it's a it's a loser.

Is it? You got to stop this.

You know what I mean?

There's other ways to make money in the record industry.

It's a loss leader.

I tour just so I can do the podcasts to make the big bucks.

Exactly.

Here's what I think you need to do.

You need to come out and you need to say like, ha ha ha.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You're all laughing. Ha ha ha. Enough.

This is the real weird Al Yankovic.

I'm not saying like change your name to regular Al Yankovic.

That's hackneyed.

OK, I'm saying you're still weird Al Yankovic.

But what's weird about it is you're not doing the comedy anymore.

That's the weirdest thing of all is you're like, no, I have some serious, serious, beautiful songs.

I could like sell condos.

I could like make a or like a pyramid thing.

Yeah, you could. I could I could sell I could sell Tupperware.

That would be amazing because there's no money in records.

They're already there.

It's sort of like, you know, a captive audience.

What are they going to leave? Exactly.

You know, you gather everyone out on stage, you bring the lights up and you're like, I want to tell you about some of these products.

You want to keep your vegetables fresh for months at a time.

I hate it when vegetables become unfresh.

I know I basically live in my crisper just because I want to make sure.

Tell me about it. I live in my crisper.

Oh, the things they're so crazy.

Crunch, crunch, crunch.

Oh, if I'm eating and I'm not saying crunch, crunch, I'm not saying I'm making the noise.

Crunch, crunch.

If I'm not saying crunch, crunch, crunch while I'm eating.

What are we even doing here?

Because the crunchiness is supposed to emulate the crunching of bones, which the lizard part of our brain gets satisfaction out of thinking we're actually now eating somebody's face.

Exactly.

Oh, my God. Have you ever like this is a hypothetical question here.

And I you know, I know that, look, you've done thousands, if not millions of interviews over the years, and you've heard all the questions before every question.

You ever find like a dead bird on the ground and you're like, this looks too delicious.

I just I got to eat this thing.

Well, that was a hypothetical question.

Let me give you a rhetorical answer. OK. Yeah.

Yeah, sorry.

The big conundrum for me is whether to eat it there or take it home and like to show it to the family, honey, look what I found and then bite the head off the hunter and gatherer.

And you want to present it to your loved ones.

I want to hunt and gather.

So look, look what I hunted.

Look what I gathered.

And you display it like I am the alpha male. Yes.

Is it important to you to be an alpha male?

It is because I tried being a zeta. Yeah.

Yeah. You went the total opposite way.

We're like every single person in the world just walked right over.

I was the omega man for a while, but there was nobody else in the world.

And that was so boring.

That was terrible. Yeah.

Just a post-apocalyptic wasteland. It was weird.

Yeah. The zombies. Exactly.

Tell me about the political Al Yankovic.

Who have you voted for in every election since you've been 18?

OK, since I've been 18.

Oh, gosh. I think was 1980 would be the first one.

That would be Pat Paulson. Great.

And 84. You know, what about the primaries, my dear fellow?

You know, Pat wasn't running in the midterms or the primaries.

You know, I kind of for Pat, you just go beyond the midterms and go go right to the four year elections. Right.

So just Pat Paulson across the board the entire time?

Pretty much. And but after he passed away, I felt like this is pointless.

Why am I still doing this?

Why am I voting? He doesn't even have a chance now. Right.

So so you've just remained a non voter since then.

Well, that's not really true.

But, you know, I feel like voting for me is sort of a personal experience.

It's just me and the four Albanians in the voting booth with me, which are basically my my voting Sherpas. Right.

So you don't look I personally think voting is a waste of time.

And I've always said it and I've always anytime.

Oh, when do people vote in November?

When is it? When are people voting these?

I don't know why I'm shaking my head.

This is stereo. This would be so cool and stereo.

It'd be amazing when people are like, I voted those I voted stickers.

It's like, come on, guys.

You know, you can just get those stickers and just wear them.

That's the thing that people don't tell you that it's like if you were to go to your sticker guy, you have a sticker guy.

Right. Of course.

If you go to your sticker guy and go like, hey, make me a bunch of stickers.

It's not like duplicating keys. No, no, they'll do it for you.

That could be like a big item on my merch table.

The summer is like, you know, you know, I have to vote again. Yeah.

I mean, sure, you got to pay him a little extra.

You know, I mean, you got to slip the wheels, you know what I mean?

Yeah, maybe slip a five under the table and then it's like, oh, what?

That's not good enough for you.

OK, here's a ten.

But once that ten is across that table, baby, you are good to go.

Yeah. And it's sticky on the back so you can stick it to anything.

Pure stickers. Mm hmm.

Oh, that's that's the thing on your merch table.

If you don't have I voted stickers on your merch table, as well as saying what's up hot dog when the concert begins, I am really going to be upset at you.

Because as we know, if people haven't heard every episode of the show, Al, I had a catchphrase at the beginning of every single episode, which was what's up, hot dog, very famous catchphrase at a certain point.

I don't know what happened.

I forget exactly.

I don't know whether I gave the legal rights transferred to me. No, I would not steal anything legally.

The right offended, sir.

Well, you're going to have to sit there and stew in it because I'm not going to take back what I said because I don't remember.

Now, the legal rights were transferred to you and you have taken my catchphrase and you presumably say this at every single every single show, except the ones you're at, because I feel I get nervous when you're around.

I would hate to be like suddenly everyone's looking at me like, that's your catchphrase.

It's embarrassing when everybody turns around and looks right at you. Right.

So and you know the ones I'm at, right? So. Oh, OK. Yeah.

So I've never heard you say it, but you say you say it every.

By the way, if you let the rights lapse and don't say it at every show, it becomes mine again. So I just want to make sure.

I think it would be confusing for you to use it now because it's so associated with me.

Al, I got to ask you, because this is this was a big news story a couple of years back and...

Iran Contra? Oh, come on, Scott. That's such old news.

I'm thinking of a little more recently. Oh, OK.

And but you don't hear much about it anymore.

But so here's here's the news story, as I understand. OK.

OK.

You have Weird Al Yankovic here and you have Dr. Dometto.

Dr. Dometto is your your mentor, some would say.

He gave you your big break in show business. That's right.

And then me here or me in the corner. That's me in the corner.

That's you in the corner.

Now you have two people with two different careers and two different names, two different surnames, two different first names.

And suddenly you hear that Weird Al Yankovic.

I don't know whether you strong armed the guy or what, you know, I don't know what the process was, but suddenly you you decided to be known as Weirdo Al Yankovic. Yes.

And you took the O from Dr. Dometto and you I don't know whether you were saying like, hey, I'm forcing you to do this or whether it was some sort of tacit agreement or something. And this is where I want to get all the details.

But you wanted him to be known as Dr. Domet. Yes.

I don't remember all the details, but that is, in fact, canon now.

He was officially on his on his driver's license and somehow on his birth certificate, changed all the way back. It's retroactive.

Yeah.

And what and what is the I mean, I'm trying to imagine how you broached the subject with him, because and was it always your goal to be Weirdo Al Yankovic?

And he was standing in the way at the time.

I know the powers, you know, differentials between, you know, he was your employer.

And I don't want to be crass, but I offered him a knuckle sandwich.

And yeah. And he's he's vegetarian and he doesn't like crunchy stuff.

So he just passed on that. Yeah. He said, no, no, thank you very much.

Wow. You truly are an alpha at this point.

So next time I come to see your show and you know, look, I'm going to let you plug it in Los Angeles, the one that you might be at next time I see your show.

I'm going to secret chopper you.

OK, and I'm going to come to one of these concerts.

I'm not going to tell you.

I expect you to be on the bill as Weirdo Al Yankovic.

I expect you to say what's up, hot dog at the very beginning.

And I expect you to be selling these God damn I voted stickers with your face on them and the American flag.

I'm saying you put the American flag on it.

Maybe instead of the 50 stars, it's your face.

I don't know. Look, I'm just spit balling here. I don't know.

The one the one the one thing I think you're getting wrong is you assume and this was never part of the deal, but you assume that I start off the show by saying, what's up, hot dog? Why? When do you say it?

It varies. It's whenever the mood strikes.

So it could be like in the middle of a song.

It could be like when I'm backstage and like there's a film going on and I yell, what's up, hot dog? But you can hear it in the audience. OK, OK.

But I'm going to secret chopper you and show up, you know.

I don't know where you're playing.

You're doing major markets and I'll let you put this in a second. But I want it. I want these three things to be happening.

Otherwise, I'm going to get litigious on you.

OK, so so you want the I voted stickers.

You want the weirdo and all Yankovic on the marquee, on the marquee, on the marquee and every bit of merch as well. OK.

And including retroactively for if you sell your old records or whatever, I need you to at least and I'm not saying, oh, ha ha ha ha.

Yeah, I bet that you want him to go back and get all those reprinted.

No, I'm saying you take a Sharpie and you put the oh, yeah.

You know what I can do?

I'm not saying I will do this, but what I can do is just leave a Sharpie there at the merch table so everybody can customize their own owes on weirdo. Well, you drive a hard bargain with, you know. OK, I'll accept that work.

You'll leave a Sharpie there.

You will sell the I voted stickers and you will say what's up, hot dog during the show.

Yeah, now the I voted stickers may look like Al TV stickers, but if you rub them really, really hard, you can see you can kind of see where it says I voted.

OK, I'll I'll accept that as well.

But the what's up, hot dog, non negotiable.

Absolutely, absolutely. All right. Very good.

Go ahead and plug your dates.

Well, all the dates are at weird Al Dotcom, which is where you can find everything good in this life.

And we were OK. What do you got there?

You got tour dates.

We have tour dates. And what else do you need?

That's it. That's it.

You got weird Al Dotcom.

Presumably you paid a lot of money for it because I don't think that you were.

I think someone must have been squatting.

It was a bidding war. It was a bidding war for sure.

And all you put up there is tour dates and random information.

Like what type of information, like where to go to see you on tour.

This is still tour dates.

Oh, it's the same thing.

I would count those two different things.

I would think with weird Al Dotcom.

I mean, this is a major Internet destination.

You'd be putting like, hey, this is what I'm up to or pictures of yourself.

There are several things. There's tour dates.

There's where you can see me on tour.

There's the kind of places that I play.

Yeah, well, there's the kind of places I play.

There's also the names of the cities where I'll be the summer and performing specific dates of when you'll be playing there as well.

That's another thing. Yes, that's a real tour dates.

Well, what about here's what you should do with your site.

And I'm I'm just throwing out ideas as your spit manager.

Yes. Yes.

Make it a site where like you put up photos of yourself, like, you know, like around the world and you like people can comment on them and you can like if anyone else that you know is in the photos, you can like tag them and people can click on those tags and be taken to their own part of the site and social media.

I mean, yeah, it sounds social and it's kind of media media, but you might have something there.

This is my thing.

Like you're putting all this stuff out there on other sites.

Put it all up on a weirdo.

Let's monetize the whole thing. You know what I mean?

Like, why are you even like like people are on this Twitter thing these days.

By the way, 10 years ago, Twitter was a new thing when I first started the show and we would have to say this Twitter thing when we talked about it.

You were like the first person on Twitter, I think.

I really I was the first. Yes.

I remember your first tweet you up.

That was it was just merely trying to get women's response.

And none because no one was on Twitter.

But why are you putting things on Twitter when it should just be on weirdo.com?

I need those clicks, baby.

You need the clicks.

Do you have ads on weirdo.com?

I don't mean ads of like the dates that you're going to be performing.

No. Let's see.

I have ad hoc arguments.

OK, that counts. That definitely counts.

Do you have pop up ad hoc arguments?

No, they just stay right where they are.

Oh, OK, great.

So go ahead and plug these dates.

You have a big tour coming up.

Yes, I have 67 days.

I'm going to name them all right now.

Starting off on June 5th at the fabulous Ruth.

Ruth's Chris Ginsburg knows we start in Florida.

We wind up where the alley dates, which you may or may not show up at.

In Florida, America's droopy penis.

That's correct.

Are you going up to Maine?

America's erect penis.

We're slowly getting less flaccid as the tour goes on and then eventually ending up in Los Angeles, the butthole of the country.

Is that the official name?

Well, now, if you look at it, if you look at it like it's a side, like it's someone it's a silhouette of someone standing, bending over.

Florida is like with the penis like going down.

Maine is up here.

Los Angeles would be like right where the farts come out.

I never really thought of it that way.

That's how you have to think.

And then Canada is like, you know, like the arms and the head and all that kind of thing.

And then Mexico is like the little legs.

And then what is Guam?

Well, Guam, we don't even know what it is.

It's like what you're standing on, I guess.

The Panama Canal is the feet.

I see.

Well, it all makes sense now.

It does.

All right. Where are you playing?

You start off in Florida, you end up somewhere else.

We're all it's a it's a world tour.

We're playing the U.S. and Canada.

So it's I'm very excited about it. Amazing.

And the L.A. and L.A.

adjacent dates are we're doing the Greek theater on August 10th.

We're doing the Pacific Amphitheater in Orange County somewhere around the same time.

Where I've seen what a great time is seeing you at the Pacific Amphitheater about 10 years ago is when Al's brain came out.

Oh, yes, yes, indeed.

I went down to see you there.

What a great time at the theater.

Thank you for showing up. Sure.

And how long does this go until?

Until the end of summer.

Wow. So all summer, all summer long.

Amazing. Are you going to be hot?

Oh, I always am.

Baby, are you going to wear like a tank top during this summer tour?

Should I?

I may also I do costume changes on this tour, so I'll just change it to different tank tops.

You're going to be doing the cost over because the last last tour was like the the the vanity tour, where it's just us out on stage playing with with no props or or costumes or anything.

I think you're going the wrong way. You go the other way.

Now you're naked.

Now I'm now I'm naked, but it's with a full orchestra.

Naked with an orchestra.

Naked with an orchestra is that's a show, Al, that I would see.

What? Well, you're seeing this anyway.

Oh, that's right. I am seeing your show.

You made the commitment.

Well, look, Al, it means the world to me that you drop by.

I mean, honestly, we couldn't do this without you.

We've been doing it for 10 years with you.

So why should it change for the anniversary?

Why should it indeed?

Well, I'll see it another 10 years then.

No, you've been seeing me several times in these 10.

Oh, how does this work now?

So you're going to have to see me several times in the next 10 years.

Oh, did you think that you were ending your commitment to the show with appearing on this show?

I didn't know how I didn't have the legalities of it.

No, no, no. You're you're locked in at this point.

I'm free to live my own life.

No, you have to live the comedy bang bang life.

Oh, I see. OK, you're a friend of the show.

You're an important part of the show.

Legally mandated friend of the show.

Al, do you have anything to say to me? Scott.

You're my best friend.

But things I don't know.

I mean, I mean, that's very nice to hear.

But I mean, I already know that.

And I'm like nice things about it's the 10 year anniversary.

Oh, yeah. That congratulations on 10 years of sobriety.

With your what?

I don't think it's been 10 minutes of sobriety.

I am currently fucked up.

But I need you for a little more feeling.

OK, OK. Thank you.

Thank you, Scott.

Ockerman, for your 10 years of comedy bang bang service.

And I will make sure that you get your 10 year comedy bang bang chip in the mail sometime soon.

Al, I got to say, not believable.

I can I I've I've seen your acting and I think you can do better.

OK. Scott, I am so happy to be here at your 10 year anniversary show.

Thank you for everything you've done for me.

And I think you've made the world of me.

I wish I am so happy for you.

Very believable.

Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you so much. That that that touched me good in the eardrums, I think.

Yeah, yeah. A little shrill.

Yeah. Tonight is myself now.

Yeah, yeah.

Al, thank you so much for being here.

Well, thank you for being here, because otherwise I would have been showing up and you wouldn't have been here.

And I've been like, he told me to be here five o'clock and I don't know what the deal is. That's a good point.

Yeah, you should really be thanking me more than I'm thanking you.

Thank you, Scott. Thanks, Al.

Oh, see you later, buddy.

Well, see you, Al Yankovic.

Wow. I tell you, it was such a thrill when he agreed to do the show for the first time.

I'm not going to say this in front of him, but now that he's gone, I remember I got his email through a mutual friend and wrote to him to ask if he would would be interviewed on this new comedy program I was doing.

And he replied within, I think within 12 or 11 seconds.

He's that thirsty for attention.

And I'm so glad he is.

And so good to see him.

And while we are doing it, so many guests over this 10 hour episode and oh, someone else coming in and.

Two door slams. Who's this?

It's Paul Rust.

I came in one foot, closed the door, then brought in the second foot and closed the door again.

Does your first foot hurt?

Oh, my goodness.

Out. It really hurts.

Hi, Paul. Our good friend Paul Rust from Netflix's Love.

Oh, it's good to be here, Scott.

Thanks for having me.

Showtime's Black Monday, one episode. Yes.

So good to see you.

Oh, it's good to see you, too.

You've been on the show.

I mean, I think triple digits now, right?

I don't know what that means.

I think I'm up in the I've been here 126 times.

I guess I mean in years.

How many years you've been doing it?

All 10 or did you come in somewhere in the first year?

Is this Scott?

I was there in the case CRW carry.

Why you were there at Andy?

What? No, Andy, one of three.

One, you were there the first year. Great.

So you've been here the entire time.

I was here. Episode three, maybe with some a couple of the scores.

My goodness. Oh, my God.

So good to see you again.

We're like we just we've transported to different places, but the the friendship has always stayed the same.

Exactly the same.

It is never waver.

It's never gotten better.

I expected it to sort of progress and enrich our lives in different ways and instead just flatline.

And we're still talking about how we're going to vote for Obama.

Yeah, of course.

We have a grown past 2009.

Paul, it's so good to see you.

Yes, thank you.

You've been on the show so many times in various guises as actor, as musician with your band, Don't Stop or We'll Die.

Mathematician. Mathematician, of course.

I came in and remember that one time.

Yeah, we had a lot of numbers that we needed crunched and you were there for us.

They were all over the floor and I had to gather them up and crunch them together.

Just crunch them together.

It was it was a big disaster.

I don't know.

But it was just somewhere around episode 206 or something.

But a fan favorite episode.

Oh, people love it.

I walk down the street and they always come up to me and go, Mathy, Mathy, my catchphrase.

Of course they do.

Yes.

Which they used to do to Walter Matthau as well.

So you're in great company.

Yeah.

But I will say that a lot of times when you're on the show, you don't come in in the best of moods.

So it's great to see you in a happy mood today.

Yeah.

Although I got to say, when I came in here and I crunched that door on my foot, it did start to darken me.

Yeah. A little bit into the country of the United States of Tara.

I peeved.

Oh, no.

So you started to get a little irritated, a little irked.

Yeah. I was going to say I was just in the United States of peeved, but then I decided to add Tara in there.

Yeah. It was a great addition.

But yes.

Oh, no.

I'm now.

Yeah.

I feel my blood boiling.

Well, please calm down.

I find myself getting angrier.

More I rate more.

We don't like that.

Ch-ch-cheesed.

Please don't get cheesed.

I know what happens when you do.

You mean I have a request about a certain piece of time and how I want it to begin?

That's what usually happens.

I'm not asking for that to happen now.

Start the clock!

Oh, no!

I just want to take this moment to thank Bill Maher, who's given me permission to do this from the very beginning.

I love you, Billy.

Thank you for letting me use this music.

And what is this that you're doing for those of you who have never heard you before?

It's called New No-Nos.

And these are things that bother you.

They bother me so much.

And then I say, no, no, no.

You know what I say?

I say I say what I'm essentially saying is these are some new rules.

Yes.

But my specific way of saying the rules are no, no.

Right.

We got differentiates as hell.

That is one of the new rules is you need to change it to no no's.

Yes, that was the first one.

The first rule of new no no's is change it from new rules and never talk about it.

Yeah.

Then the second rule is change it from new rules to new no no's.

So talk about it.

Yeah.

And don't talk about it.

Yeah.

All right.

So you have some new no no's here, some 10th anniversary new no no's.

The stuff that bothers us and I have rules about how to change it.

And they are specifically for 10 years.

Got all of them.

Oh, one you'll find out is about that.

OK, let's hear them.

This is no no no.

You ever notice, Scott, how people always refer to 10 years as a decade?

I have noticed that that is another way to phrase it.

This decade was 10 years long.

Oh, that decade was 10 years long.

Why is it they never refer to 11 years as a decade?

Why do they ever refer to a decade as 12 years or even three years?

Oh, I know why.

Hypocrisy.

From now on, a decade is any span of time.

No, no, no. A decade is any year you love.

You suddenly remembered the format right at the end there.

You say no, no, no.

I appreciate that.

No, no, no. I'm remembering the format now.

No, no, no.

I need a bandaid for my boo boo.

You ever hear people say that you go into a pharmacy?

You got eight, eight or nine people walking around screaming.

How tall are these people? Are they about three apples high?

I need a bandaid for my boo boo.

How about I give you a bandaid for your poo poo?

No, no, no.

Instead of blood, I'm concerned about your shit.

This is OK. All right.

No, no, no.

You ever get on the phone line with people and it's like, if you would like to join our club, please press one.

If you would like to change of address, please press two.

These are the choices.

Always. Any time you call.

And you're calling them.

Yeah. All right.

Very confused at the premise, but continue.

Well, when they're listing these off to me, please press one.

Please. I want to say if you are slowly losing your goddamn mind, please press nine.

No, no, no. I make the numbers now.

I'm the captain now, Tom Hanks.

Do you see that movie?

No, no, no, no.

I've never seen Captain Rillips.

That's how dumb I am.

Is you think Phillips is Willis?

Yeah. Oh, I think the theme song ended.

So we got to restart the clock.

These get better the more they go.

No, no, no.

B. Oh, you ever hear people say, oh, this room smells like B.

Oh, B. Oh, body odor.

That's what I heard. They said it stands for body odor.

I think it should stand for only one thing.

One of the kings of all comedy.

Bob Odenkirk.

Yeah, I love Mr. Show.

No, no, no. Mr. Show Show.

Bobbo, B. Oh, Bob Odenkirk.

Two more, two more, two more.

No, no, no. You ever go online and you get a pop up ad?

Oh, this steams me.

Now you're talking my language.

I'm trying to read some text, and instead I got to look at a pop up ad for a new pill.

Mm hmm. No, no, no.

If I get a pop up ad, then I'm going to call your parents and tell them I got it.

No, no, no.

Pop down, pop down, pop down.

Steam up the end.

You just seem sad.

I'm OK. I'm just sad because it's wrapping up.

And I know all your viewers are sad.

This is the last one.

Yeah, I wish you hadn't said two more because now everyone knows this is the last one.

We're sad now. Set their clock.

I say start the clock, but I'm also saying their internal body rhythms of like, how many new no no's am I going to listen to?

How long do I have for my refractory period to build up again?

Sure. This final new no no.

Well, here it is, your final new no no of ten years.

And I was right.

They've all been about a ten year anniversary.

And this is your best one of all the ten years.

Oh, yes. I always end with the best one.

New no no.

You ever go you ever been watching a TV and a commercial comes on?

Have you seen these commercials?

Very similar to your pop up ads.

But OK. Yeah, I have seen commercials.

But the thing is about a pop up ad that pops up, you can just knock it down.

It's done in a commercial.

You can pass forward.

You gotta sit there for one commercial for what?

Two, three, four, five minutes.

One commercial Super Bowl, maybe.

Hey, no, no, no.

I want a dial that's underneath my tongue that I can twist it and fast forward through the commercial.

No, no, no. My great tongue speeds time.

That was the best one.

Thank you. Oh, thanks, Billy.

Yet more. Oh, new no no's.

Paul Rust. Amazing. Thank you so much.

Well, thank you for having me and thank you for letting me walk through the door twice.

My pleasure. It's great to see you.

I mean, it's a relief to know that the door won't ever open again.

I mean, the door just I think someone and I was saying that someone just.

Yeah, that's embarrassing for you.

For me, it's mortifying. Who's this?

This must be another one of our old favorite guests here.

Does a duck clack?

Huh? I sort of remember someone saying that once.

It's me, Ernie Bread.

Ernie Bread.

One of the most beloved guests in the 10 years of this show.

I kind of remember you came on once and acted like everyone knew you.

And yeah, in late 2017.

And yet we didn't.

And it turned out you were just a guy who hangs out at the pond across the street where the L.A. pond, where there are ducks, which led you to your catchphrase.

Does a duck clack? And does it?

We never found out. Yes, it does.

It does. OK. And I didn't know either.

I understand. You were just asking the question.

That's why I started going to the pond every day.

Right. And when did you get your answer? Oh, day two. Day two.

Oh, OK. They were shot. Very silent.

They had laryngitis day one.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it was winter late 2017. Yeah.

Ernie, so good to see you.

We're doing kind of a special show where.

Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm obviously an obvious choice for it.

Yeah. This is Paul Rust.

Oh, yeah. Big fan.

Oh, yeah. I I'm a big fan of the Ernie Bread character as well.

Well, I'm a human man with genitals and blood and piss and shit.

And I mean, I did do my character, Major Thackeray.

Oh, we did enjoy that.

That's who I actually know you as.

Yeah. Yeah. What was Major Thackeray's backstory?

Well, I I basically said my name in a British accent and then I was shouted down.

That sounds like the show. Yeah.

Is Bread your Christian given name?

Yeah. So it's just a coincidence that the ducks love probably little chunks of your last name. That's true.

It's the B, the R, the B.

Not those ads.

We don't want to talk about those.

Don't get me riled up about those ads, both in pop up and commercial form.

But I thought maybe I should let you know some some more solemn news.

Oh, everything OK, Ernie?

I don't I don't know what your baseline is, so I'm not sure what would be more solid.

It's been obviously a great run. Sure. Of one episode.

This is going to be my final appearance.

No, Ernie.

We were supposed to do this in unison.

We remember how we rehearsed it. Right, right, right.

Oh, no. Ernie Bread's not returning anymore.

This is terrible news. Thank you.

Yeah, it's been 10 wonderful years, but I think it's kind of time to move on and do some new stuff.

So even though you first appeared in 2017, you were a part of the show over these last 10 years.

Oh, I always considered myself sort of a yeah, a beloved part of the show.

Yeah. Yeah, I can see that one appearance and a great appearance.

Yeah, but even I would see the building from across the street.

And I was just you across the street every single day at that pond.

Well, yeah, I know the ducks to starve.

That's true. Right.

Ernie, babe, what can we do to like get you to change your mind?

Oh, no, no, I don't.

Don't go, Ernie. People love you.

No, no, I understand.

They love me, but it's it's it's been a good run.

And I think it's time for me to move on time for you to recede from the spotlight.

Yeah. You know, it's like when you're reading a book, you might love a chapter of it, but you don't keep rereading that chapter.

You move on to the next chapter. Yeah, that's right.

So what is the next chapter?

I mean, I can't even imagine, let alone comedy bang bang without Ernie bread or Ernie bread without comedy bang bang.

I'm just going to just doesn't make any sense to me. I know.

Well, I've been thinking I'm going to go to the pond every day and feed the ducks.

You've been doing that.

Yeah, but it's been punctuated by visits here and I'm not going to do that anymore.

You're not going to sell out anymore.

I just I'm more of a listener than a producer.

Have you ever listened to the show? Oh, yeah.

You have. OK, that's good. Yeah. OK, good.

I think I can't remember if we talked about that.

I think I've committed to saying I have because I yes.

OK, great. Well, I'm going to miss you as a participant, but we could.

Scott, how can you just accept this?

I guess I'm in.

I'm not I'm in the of Dabda at this point.

You're still in the Duh.

This is like Lauren saying goodbye, Hans.

Goodbye. So long, Franz.

Oh, Hans and Franz.

I thought you said Hans.

I was wondering why he was chopping off his own hands.

That's like George Lucas saying goodbye, Han.

Goodbye, Franz Solo.

He should have gotten married to Franz Solo.

Yeah. Why didn't Hans Solo marry Franz Solo?

Well, look, I just have to accept it.

I know the winds of change are upon us.

And that's what the show is all about.

You know, I mean, people come in, they they do a lot of episodes the first year or so, then they get work and they get too busy and they all leave.

Yeah. And then I have to beg them to return.

And we can play a little montage of some of the highlights of my visits from over the years.

Oh, God, I want the microphone to short out from my tears.

I do want that. So, yeah, let's let's play this montage.

OK, let's go.

Mm hmm. Hello, it's me, Major Thackeray.

That's the end. Does it duck quack?

Oh, OK. There's a little more.

No, no, that was me saying yes.

Oh, is that the end? Does it duck quack?

Yeah. Yes, it is the end.

It's the transition.

Can we later add that part to the actual montage?

Yeah. Would that be OK?

I mean, you'll have to talk to the editors, but yeah. OK.

I don't know if I want to talk to the editors, Paul.

Yeah, I those nerds.

The last don't even get me started on Harvey scissor hands.

Oh, of course.

The most famous we're supposed to do this together.

Of course, the most famous editor of them all.

And the thing people most hate him for the most notorious thing about Harvey Weinstein is how he'll come into the edit room and change your vision.

He's canceled. You have to admit that.

Oh, yeah. Good. Yeah. Good. Good.

Well, Ernie, we're going to miss you.

But, you know, if you're ever across the street feeding those ducks your namesake, you know, and you just get a wild hair up your butt and you want to come by.

We're not going to hold you to this, you know.

Well, I Paul might be very nice.

I won't say I would.

But yeah, I don't think I won't.

But yeah, thanks so much.

And I don't believe it.

I don't believe you must be.

You're going to go home and you're going to change your mind.

Well, also, Paul, I'm telling you something.

This isn't how you end a bit and just go, oh, yeah, that's it.

And then back slowly out of the room.

He's got something up his sleeve.

No, I swear I don't.

I'm look, I'm opening the door to leave.

No, he's got he's going to punctuate this.

I know comedy structure. He's got a big finish.

I know. I just just please come to my funeral because I'm going to kill myself.

Oh, what? He's gone.

I mean, I guess that's oh, my gosh.

I should we run after him or and stop him?

Hey, I'm back. I'm back. Oh, OK.

I misled you there at the end.

I wasn't able to get a time slot at the funeral home, so there will not be a funeral.

But you're still going.

Oh, no, you're sleeping.

Hey, bye. They have time slots.

I guess you have to work for them.

And you can play on the reserve them in advance.

I don't know. I think Ernie is the victim of a cruel hoax.

I asked me, I hope we're not the I mean, I hope we are the victims of hoaxes.

I hope he doesn't actually do it.

Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

I hope we're the victims of this cruel.

Yeah, exactly.

Should we run after him, though? Because I feel like that's excuse me.

Oh, oh, this is voices.

Gruff. It's a gruff as gruff as an old man.

Were you friends with my son, Ernie?

Oh, yes. Could it could it be Mr.

Bubba Bubba Bubba Bubba Bubba Bubba?

We were supposed to do that. OK, sorry. Could it be? Could it be?

Is it Mr. Bubba Bubba Bubba Bubba?

Bonus. Just for the fans.

Just for the fan service.

Mr. Bubba Bubba Bubba Bread?

That's right. It's me, Mr. Bread.

You're an old man, I can tell by your voice.

My son just killed himself.

Oh, you know. Oh, no.

Mr. Bread. We're sorry, Mr. Bread.

Yes, he just walked out to your lobby and swallowed a cyanide capsule.

Oh, of his own or I know we kept those in a jar, but I thought it was locked up.

It was one that had been passed down from the time of Christ.

Christ. Our name is Christ.

It is true. If you check the Bible, he had a cyanide capsule in his teeth that he was just going to bite down on the cross.

If he ever felt like he was too much to handle.

He's like, I am out of here.

Dennis Miller style. Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Bread.

This is terrible news.

Did you have the cyanide capsule and you passed it down to him?

Yes, I have too much to live for.

What? You don't have a son anymore.

Do you have your own lake, your own ducks?

I don't need a lake.

What are these ducks?

Huh? OK, so you. Alright, Mr. Bread.

No, I know you're grieving.

But now he just seems stupid.

Mr. Bread. Yes.

Is there a Mrs. Bread?

All right. All right, Paul.

I know I wanted to ask you, too, but his son just passed away.

There is a Mrs. Bread, yes.

Not a day goes by that she doesn't have a big old smile on her face.

Well, today my future like a queen.

Today might be the day.

Today, I mean, her son just passed away, so I don't know whether she'll have that smile.

But a frown is just an upside down smile.

I've always said it.

Oh, yes. And sometimes when we're sixty nine, it gets hard to tell.

OK, Mr. Bread. Not that kind of show.

Oh, Mr. Bread, how can we help you?

We didn't know your son all that well.

He told me you were his best friend.

Oh, that is incorrect.

He said that.

Yes, before he took his cyanide suppository, he told me.

I I knew it was a pill, but.

Oh, for him to do that damage on that sweet little ass.

You know, you know, you noticed it too as he was walking away.

He left several times that I was so happy he came back in and left.

Keep coming back and out.

But to know that that cyanide capsule fizzed up that ass.

Yes. Well, imagine having to wipe it like I did.

She was a baby.

Oh, when you're oh, you didn't just wipe it right now.

No, but I never got over that.

I always hated him.

You hated it. You hated yourself.

The ass thing. Yeah.

Well, we didn't like him all that much either.

So, yeah, for him to say that we're his best friends is actually probably more.

That makes me like and less knowing that he said that.

Yeah, which is not the intended effect.

Well, Mr. Bread, I like you, though.

You're pretty cool. You're old, but you're pretty cool.

Yeah. You came in with wearing that on that surfboard.

You. Mm hmm. Yeah.

I get up, I surf every morning.

I don't see any of these dogs.

Ducks. Yes, exactly.

But do you say goodbye to your wife?

You treat her like a queen on your way out.

Oh, yes. I kissed every inch of her body and head out to the beach.

Wow. You know, the skin is the world's largest organ or the bodies.

I believe it. Well, you're you're kissing every inch of it every day, so you must know it.

Yes. Yes. Well, talk about me.

Wait a minute. It's me, Mama Bread.

Mama Bread. My luscious wife.

Mama Bread, this is Paul Rust.

And I'm Scott Aukerman.

And it's great. I'm enchanted to meet you, Mama Bread.

All right. Keep it in your pants, Paul.

I heard there was she is she is beautiful and has a lot of skin.

The world's largest organ.

I got the most skin of anyone.

Yeah, I you have a lot of skin.

It's all loose. It's all hanging off of your gray.

It's gray. Yeah. I hadn't gotten to the color yet.

I love that color.

And you can come home.

Keep kissing my skin.

Of course, my angel.

I got a rolling pin and it's getting bigger.

I don't know what she's talking about.

I'm going to beat you in my ever growing rolling pin.

Why is it getting larger or are you just walking closer to it?

I'm walking closer to an optical illusion.

That's an illusion, dear.

Well, you do treat her like a queen.

I have to say she's my angel.

Well, look, we don't have time for you to make out.

We have to miss my son.

We I thought we would get to hear about this one.

He didn't like it.

Do you? Yeah, you had to change him.

You never changed your son. The whole butt thing.

No, that was daddy's work.

Well, look, guys, we don't have time to talk to you anymore.

I ate the diapers.

I wrote Mama Bread.

Look, I just want to say that.

Mr. Bread and Mama Bread are looking forward to many more visits over the next 10 years.

I don't know. He retired, but it makes it new that I'm here with him.

I don't know if the second decade of this show is going to be the Bread Family Decade. There's lots of them.

Scott, will you promise that you'll bring Mama Bread, Mr.

Bread and me together?

And the three of you? All right.

We'll do one episode with the three of you, if that's OK.

We've been working on a sort of a trio.

Good night, sweetheart.

Well, well, I mean, there's three of you, so I'd love to hear you sing it together.

Sure. We're going to do three part harmony.

Track it later.

Yes, we'll use digital tracking.

So yeah, digital tracking.

You got right. You guys are fans of digital tracking.

We love digital tracking.

All right. All right.

Gosh, never heard to guess more into digital tracking.

Go ahead and sing.

Good night, sweetheart.

It's time to go.

And that's it. Oh, does a duck quack?

Quack quack. Oh, boy.

Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

Oh, boy. There's a duck in all the ducks have gathered up.

My son's body like the penguins at the end of Batman Returns.

Oh, my goodness.

All right, guys. Well, it's really great.

It really was great to me.

I mean, thank you so much for dropping by Mr.

Bread, Mama Bread and Paul, of course.

We'll be back soon.

I don't know about that.

We'll see you back at the end of the show.

Oh, I don't think so.

All right. Thank you so much for coming, guys.

Thank you, Ed Scott.

Truly, thank you for these 10 years of laughs and mirth and giggles.

You brought joy and entertainment to people across the globe.

Oh, and now I'm bringing you a kiss.

No, Mr. Bread, you're not part of this.

Oh, I thought I was an important part of the first 10 years.

I could remember.

Just not the kissing part of it.

All right, guys. Thank you.

Thank you. OK.

Oh, so great to see those two.

I mean, great to see Paul. Definitely.

I don't know what to think about Ernie Bread, but guys, we need to take a break.

We're at that point where we need to go to another break.

When we return, we have so much more show still, still so much more show.

Can you believe it?

We will be right back with more comedy bang bang after this comedy bang bang. Welcome back.

We are, I believe, three quarters of the way through our world's longest podcast, very special episode, 10 hour episode for the 10 years of comedy bang bang.

And I got to tell you, it has been so pleasant seeing all of these wonderful faces, both from the past and the present.

Such such warm sentiments being expressed by them.

And, you know, I got to tell you, none of the, you know, not yet, at least none of the real weirdos who have come by, especially the ones who are sort of not my favorite people, if I may be so bold.

So it's been great. It's been a wonderful time here.

And hello. Oh, no.

Hello. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

This is not happening.

Hello. Not today.

Not today of all days.

Hello. No, no, no, no.

It can't be. No.

Oh, no.

Oh, oh, my God.

Forville, how are you?

Good. Good to see you.

Very good. How are you feeling right now?

Are you not feeling on edge?

You're not feeling great.

Just me, Lou Orphan, Lou Orphan, for lack of a better term, you're not feeling postal at all.

Or like I don't work for the postal.

Oh, good. I mean, we are a stamps dot com office around here.

Yeah, correct. Yeah.

It's so easy to do it from home.

Sure. Forville, the little tiny orphan boy who has come by the studio several times.

That's me for a little orphan boy.

Oh, you are so cute.

Every time I see you, I forget how murderous you are.

I know it's hard because I love to stay, but I can't help it.

It's just inside. But I'm really just happy to see you.

It's good to be back.

Oh, Forville, you're approximately knee high.

I'm three apples high.

Three apples high.

Is that how high they are?

I think that I think cannon smurfs are three apples high.

Oh, do you ever hope to be four apples someday?

Oh, someday.

Someday. But you've you've been a little orphan boy for so many years.

So many years.

We're celebrating the 10th anniversary of the show.

I don't know.

Congratulations.

That's why I brought you this ham.

Oh, this is a.

Congratulations.

This is a ham gift.

This is not in the shape of a ham.

This is in the shape of it looks to be like an actor's penis.

It happens to be Jay Davidson's penis.

You brought me Jay Davidson's penis?

I brought you a little penis scrap.

Well, I don't think that I want to eat this.

Congratulations on 10 years of speaking into a microphone.

Yep. Can you believe it?

Can you believe you did it?

When I remember the first day I ever saw a microphone when I was a little boy.

Little did I know I would speak into one for 10 years.

And you sitting down, probably done damage to yourself.

Probably. Yeah.

Maybe I need a standing desk while I do this show.

Time to start staying.

Maybe a very dense 10 more years of standing.

And then what?

And then stab at everybody around you.

OK, I don't think that I get all this stuff.

I've become in rich.

That's not I worry that that you feel like that's a pathway to success for.

That's not what a grown adult would do.

A grown adult works hard every day and then hopefully has some sort of degree of success in their life and then dies happy.

That's a grown adult, though. I'm four of them.

A little orphan boy from the streets.

You know, the hard way.

I got to take it when I can get it, you know what?

When you say you learn the hard way and you learn from the streets, what exactly do you mean?

You've never gone into what what happened out there on the streets.

I'm a little orphan boy and I've grown up.

I've had a hard time.

You killed your parents.

Did you not killed so many Scott in the past?

Because my parents, I believe I've killed a sea leotard.

Nimoy, weirdo, Yankovic, Prince.

Oh, I killed a lot of people.

Yeah. Yeah. And but not me.

Thank you. Batman may have killed Prince.

I mean, I can't read.

But don't say Batman, by the way.

I'm worried that he's going to drop by.

Oh, the Batman.

Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't come by.

I hope he doesn't come by.

He's so scary.

But I mean, wait a minute.

Oh, no. Do you hear that?

Oh, no. What a coincidence.

I don't think it's a coincidence.

I think he hears his name and he appears.

Oh, no. The creature who stalks the night.

The one who calls himself.

Zing!

Where is she?

Where?

Where is she?

Why aren't you answering me? Is my music too loud?

Where is she?

Yeah, if you could turn your music down a little bit.

Who me? Yes, you, Batman.

Where is she?

Who are you talking about, Batman?

I'm the Batman.

Where is she?

I don't know who you're talking about, but what about him?

Where is he? This is this is a murderous little orphan boy.

It's me. Little orphan for the boy.

Batman, thank God you've come in time.

I'm here.

To stop Nancy O'Dell from the Rico Act.

I believe.

Batman.

Yes.

Me?

Have you been looking for a suspect in any stabbing murders lately?

There's been some crime happening lately.

Some small crime.

Small when you say small crime, do you mean knee high?

Knee high crime.

Happening in the streets.

What's been going on, Batman?

What's been happening?

Thank you for asking.

You're welcome.

I need some water.

Yeah, go ahead. Drink some water, Batman.

I know a lot. Yeah, it doesn't get portrayed in the movies all that much, but you're constantly drinking water because of your gravelly voice.

That's correct.

Whoa. Thank you for stopping your music.

But it cut out quick.

So speaking of cut out quick, what sort of knee high crime has been happening?

We've we've had some knee high crime.

A lot of cats and dogs being stabbed.

Oh, no. Cats and dogs?

Correct.

Smaller people.

Smaller people?

Yes.

Why the long pause as I'm speaking of cats?

Touche.

I don't think it's a touche when you haven't offered anything to touche.

Touche.

But so little, little tiny cats and dogs.

I mean, oh, I dogs.

I pray that Danny DeVito is stabbed.

Danny DeVito, the penguin himself.

The penguin himself.

Oh, no.

I pray that Andrew Lloyd Webber, he was on the show earlier.

He's been familiar.

Yeah. He's been transformed into something about two feet high as well with with the technology from the Cats movie that they're doing with all the actors.

So I hope he's safe out there.

Me, too.

But hashtag me, too.

Hashtag. That's what that was about.

I think so.

Forville, you haven't seen Andrew Lloyd Webber, have you?

Remember him?

This isn't my only time without him.

I've never been on the show without him.

Really? You hope nothing happened?

Oh, no.

Hope he wasn't stibbity stabbed at all.

That would be horrible.

Andrew Lloyd Webber is one of our oldest friends.

I would be so angry.

What would you do?

Would you use your vigilante justice to arrest Forville or something?

Who me?

Yes, you.

I don't know.

What do you do all day, Batman?

Why?

No.

No, it's who me.

I said hi.

I was going to say the word hi.

Instead you said hi.

OK, sorry.

It came out as why to me.

I'm rich, so I put a why.

You're rich.

I'm rich. I'm rich.

Your your secret identity is rich?

Yeah.

Rich who?

No, no, no, no.

Not like my name would come rich.

Oh, meaning you're seeing.

Oh, I see Richard Batman.

So you meaning your wish.

I was. That's a dope name in your secret identity.

You're very wealthy.

I'm.

Maybe let's just say I'm wealthy where wherever I'm at, I'm good.

Money wise.

OK, yeah, you're very well.

I mean, there's only two or three people in the city that you could be.

There's probably there's a Tim Cook.

Yeah, I don't live in the OK.

No, I'm not Tim Cook.

You're not Tim Cook.

Where to go?

I swear to God.

OK, what about who's the Amazon guy?

Jeff something Jeff Probst.

Who is it?

Probst.

Are you Jeff Probst?

Who me?

Yes.

Are you Mark Burnett?

Well, in my my heart, I am.

We all are.

Yeah, are we?

Getting that sweet Roma Downey Jr. runoff.

Roma Downey.

Wait, Roma Downey Jr.

What's her name?

Roma.

Look, Batman, we're getting wildly off track.

Me?

Yes, you.

Why do you are you constantly wondering if I'm talking to you when I say Batman?

Do you have another name that you go by?

That's a possibility.

OK, I'm going to suss this out at some point.

Surely you can be billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne.

He's a layabout and constantly drunk.

That's not very nice.

He's a pretty good guy.

He's a good guy.

He's a great guy.

Run into come into contact with him.

Bruce fucking Wayne.

I mean, he's dope.

I know that you have like the best guy.

He's so cool.

He's nice.

What's cool about him?

He's got so much stuff.

Yeah, I mean, he's got so much stuff.

He's got a giant penny.

I think I already got the best giant in Gotham City.

Is that why he's a billionaire?

Because he has giant pennies?

Yeah, probably.

Because all his money's huge.

No, I think he's great.

I don't know.

I don't know about it.

You couldn't possibly be him, though, because he's so just irresponsible.

He's not that he's really hard working.

He's not irresponsible.

Hard working?

He's busy.

He inherited everything from his parents.

Well, actually, but he also worked hard.

Then he watched them die in front of them.

Well, sure.

I mean, so did Forville, though, and Forville.

But yeah, but that was fun.

I mean, you're directly...

I enjoyed it.

Well, not enjoyed it.

You're the cause.

I didn't like to see.

I know I was the cause, but I don't want to be this way.

Speaking of the cause...

I'm kind of like a little Batman.

Did you arrest the cause?

I thought it was my first Batman.

Oh, no, I'm not talking to you, Forville.

Oh, no, but I did.

You arrested Bill Cosby?

Yeah, I'm a little crime fighter sometimes.

Really?

That's amazing.

That's very good of you, thanks for the help.

You know, I'm thinking about, in the recent movies, Batman, you...

Who me?

Yes, you.

You didn't have a partner.

And here's, you know, a little orphan.

I did not have a ward.

You didn't have a ward, sure.

I need a ward.

Here's a little orphan boy whose parents have left him too soon, admittedly from his own hand.

That's correct.

But, you know, Forville, I could see you in a little diamond mask.

Ooh!

And a ball gag.

No, no, no, never mind, not that.

What, what are you gonna say?

A little diamond mask and a yellow cape.

Little turned up boots with little shoes and a little belt buckle.

Almost wings and a jaunty R on your chest.

Got a cool little haircut that flips in the wind.

Yeah!

Cool, cool.

Maybe you guys could fight crime together.

Would you let me do that, Batman?

I would like nothing more.

We are now the dynamic duo.

Wow.

Forville.

Why does he get top billing?

Batman, you have to stand up for yourself.

I'm a power bottom.

Batman, just like Ebenezer Scrooge?

Fuck, yeah.

Yeah, correct.

Notorious power bottom?

Notorious power bottom, Ebenezer Scrooge.

Best friend to Batman, amongst other things.

I didn't know two power bottoms could have so much in common.

But look.

It's a beautiful thing.

I can't believe it.

I finally have a little jib job.

And maybe, you know, you could adopt him as your ward at some point.

And then you could become my daddy.

I guess it's... a ward relationship is not necessarily father-son, is that right?

Not necessarily father-son.

It's more of a mentorship.

If you come up to me with advice.

I don't know the legality of just having a ward.

And he lives at your house.

Yeah, I don't.

It's more like...

I feel like it's just like your cousin is staying with you for a long time.

On the futon?

Just like those rules.

Don't touch him in any weird ways.

Keep out of the medicine cabinet.

You know what I'm saying.

Sure.

That'll be great.

I can't wait.

And I don't know where you live, Batman.

Probably some sort of a cavern or...

No need to give details.

No need to try and figure it out.

Okay.

Not on, you know, let's keep it a secret is what I'm trying to say.

On mic, yeah.

Yeah.

Well, that's... this is great.

I mean, what a wonderful relationship.

And I feel like responsible that we put it together.

It's almost like a love connection here.

It's...

I'm like Chuck Woolery, but without all the bad stuff.

You're exactly like Chuck Woolery.

And we'll be back in two and two.

Wow.

Congratulations, guys.

Thank you.

This is incredible.

What crimes are you going to investigate first?

Mostly crimes by penguins or...

I think tonight we'll do... since Danny DeVito was stabbed and now we know what's for.

Well, that one's solved.

Right.

Okay.

And now that I've hired him, I may have to arrest myself in some capacity.

Yeah.

Is there some sort of...

We'll get into that.

This is an Alfred thing.

I feel like...

Yeah.

Who is Alfred?

Who me?

No, are you Alfred?

Really?

Is that your name?

Alfred?

Zip.

Hello.

Oh my God, Alfred.

It is clearly me, Alfred Pennyworth.

Alfred Pennyworth, the butler to Bruce Wayne, the billionaire playboy.

Bruce Wayne.

Oh my gosh.

Billionaire playboy, Bruce Wayne.

You unzipped your Batman costume and it's you.

Wow.

So underneath, it was me the entire time.

So you... are you siphoning off... are you embezzling Bruce Wayne's money or something to pay for this whole Batman escapade?

Zip.

Hello.

You zipped back up the Batman costume and now you're just Batman.

Okay.

So there's a lot of... so that one's going to be hard to explain.

Right.

So what type of... tonight, what kind of murder or crime are you going to be investigating?

Tonight, I'll go to the top of a building and I'll perch on the corner of it and I will have my cape flap in the wind.

And I will stand just nearby with my chest up and my little cape flapping in the breeze.

When you say just nearby, do you mean at the top of the building, at the bottom down below?

Just nearby, like a block away or somewhere in the cinematic that we can get in the shot or something.

Okay.

You guys are filming this?

I mean, maybe if someone was, it would be cool.

It's 2019, could get a drone or something.

Oh sure, yes.

Yeah.

And then I'll stand nearby and I'll wait.

And then when something happens, I'll swoop down and I'll stab that motherfucker in the face.

Oh, I don't think that that's how we do this.

Yeah.

Normally, Batman, I mean, you don't use guns because of the gun that killed your parents.

Yeah.

Yes.

From what I've heard...

What do you mean?

I just Batman lore.

I've heard something regarding that.

Yes.

Tony Shalhoub killed my parents.

Yeah.

Right.

Tony Shalhoub killed your parents.

Yes.

In this universe.

But, uh, uh, uh, uh, stabbing.

I don't know if Batman...

You're not going to get down with that?

I hate it.

You hate it?

I hate stabbing.

Why?

Because it's the worst.

It's just me.

It's just gruesome and terrible.

Who likes stabbing?

Yeah.

Gutting people like a fish.

I also don't want a young boy to do it.

Yeah.

This, I mean...

This fourfold is essentially what would have happened to me if I turned bad.

Maybe you can turn him around.

It's almost like I'm a little joker boy.

Wait a minute.

We literally...

I am going to wait 60 seconds until I do anything next.

All right.

Countdown starting now.

60, 59, 58, 57.

Batman, your gravelly voice is elongating these seconds there.

Can we...

59.

Oh, awesome.

60.

Wait, you went back up to 60.

59.

Oh no.

Okay.

Four, three, two, two, one.

What were we going to do?

I don't know.

We were just going to wait.

That's all.

And now we're going to continue.

Yes.

Now we're...

Little joker boy.

Stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp, stamp.

Ow, ow.

It doesn't hurt me.

I'm wearing armor.

You fool.

Body armor, Kevlar vest.

I tried to get you because I'm a little joker boy.

Yeah.

Oh my God.

Fourfold work.

His mouth is jolting.

I'm a little joker boy.

Oh my God.

The corners are turning up into a grotesque smile.

Hello.

Oh my God.

Are you the joker?

That's me.

I'm a little joker boy.

Oh my God.

His skin is turning pale.

Oh my goodness.

And his hair.

He fell off the table and there's a little tiny vat of chemicals.

Oh no.

The tiniest vat.

Hey!

The tiniest vat.

Snorp.

Fourfold, I feel like this is kind of a lateral move considering your entire past.

It's pretty much just me with makeup on.

Yeah, I know.

But this is, uh, I'm sorry.

I guess the partnership didn't work out, Batman.

That did not work out.

It went down fast.

I mean, your ward tried to stab you within five minutes of you agreeing to take him on.

Who me?

It's you, Batman!

I did not know who you were talking to at that time.

Richard Batman.

Hello.

I'm Bat-Bathu- it was Bath-Bathuman, right?

Bathu Richard Man.

Right.

Well, Batman, I'm sorry that it didn't work out here.

It's okay.

But hopefully you can come back on the show and we'll eventually find- I will return to the night.

Oh, okay.

Alone.

Where I belong.

Do you need any kind of exit music?

I noticed you brought out your iPhone and- You should give me a minute.

Yeah, sure.

I am the creature- Are we gonna count down from 60?

Who leaves in the night?

60.

59.

58.

59.

60.

Oh, wow.

Suddenly cut off and he's gone.

Well, Forval, AKA the Joker.

AKA the little Joker boy.

I'm so sorry.

Congratulations, Scott.

Thank you.

Our quest to find you parents has come up fruitless again.

It'll never work.

It'll never happen.

I think it's because of your personality.

It's true.

I've been myself.

I've been a little spider boy.

I've been a Batman.

I'm now the Joker.

I've been my own foe.

What a road we have traveled in these ten years.

What a road over the past ten years.

It's amazing.

Well, I'm so glad that you came back here for the celebration.

Me too.

As frightened of you as I am, I don't think it would have been a proper ten year celebration without you.

Correct.

Well, thank you, Forval.

It's so great to see you.

I love you.

Congratulations.

Thank you so much.

But don't stab me on your way out.

This is going to be a nice one.

I know I'm between you and the door, but I will come back to stab you again another day.

Oh, thank you so much.

But today you're free.

Thank you, Forval.

Enjoy the ham.

It's really Jay Davidson's piece.

I'm not putting that in my mouth.

Put it in your goddamn mouth.

Bye Forval.

Bye.

Oh, wow.

That was a close one.

Oh boy.

I am so glad I escaped with my life after that.

Forval, one of the most dangerous, dangerous guests we have ever had on this show.

Don't let his adorable voice fool you.

He is a monster.

But wow.

So that and that's what happens here on Comedy Bang Bang.

Sometimes things get a little treacherous.

They get a little dangerous for both me and the guests.

But you know that when you've been doing a show for 10 years, some people are going to try to murder you.

That just happens.

You know, I would I would imagine it happens more with some hosts.

I would think Piers Morgan.

He gets some people attempt to murder him every other day.

I would imagine with me.

You know, it's maybe once every three months.

So those are good odds.

But I tell you that.

Oh my goodness.

Who is saying, ooh, ooh, ooh, as they approach?

So many oohs in so little time.

Happy birthday, Scott.

Is this who I think it is?

And let me let me tell you who I think it is.

I think it's Eugenia Wobbles.

Ding dong, the witch is dead.

I would love to see a game show where if you got an answer right, they played a snippet of The Wizard of Oz.

Eugenia, you're wonderful to see from the great British baking show.

That's right.

Yes, I was on one season.

I did get kicked off fairly quickly.

But you know, baking has remained a passion of mine.

Thank you so much for letting us know that.

There was some confusion regarding that.

And you cleared it right up.

So I appreciate that.

And me, I clear things up.

If something's dirty, I'll sweep it all under the rug.

Now, that's not really a good cleaning technique.

I brought you a birthday cake, Scott.

Oh my goodness.

Thank you so much.

I mean, it's the birthday of the show.

But it's not my birthday.

It's the show's birthday.

The show is- What the fuck am I doing?

Making a cake.

Why the fuck did I bring a birthday cake?

Well, it's the show's birthday, but we could eat it.

Stupid Eugenia.

Eugenia, don't be so hard on yourself.

Oh, bad girl.

You bad, you bad girl.

Oh my god, you're slapping yourself.

Oh, it surprised me.

I didn't realize I was going to slap myself, and then I did.

Eugenia, don't be so hard.

It's really my birthday, the show's birthday.

What's the diff?

Let's cut into this cake.

What do you say?

Wait a minute.

Are you only 10 years old?

I'm not a 10 year old boy.

No.

Oh, that's what I thought the whole time.

You thought I was a 10 year old boy?

Yes, I thought this was your 10th birthday.

I made you a cake of peanuts and old milk duds.

Old?

Yeah, I found them in my attic.

How new were the peanuts?

Brand new.

I got them at Gelson's Market on my way here.

Oh, well, thank you so much.

So new peanuts, old milk duds, and cake, I presume?

No, no, no.

And a lot of, a lot of glue and binding agents.

Normally one uses frosting for that.

No.

I'll pour you a, I'll pour you a pile of glue and I'll pour you a pile of frosting.

You can't tell the difference.

That is true.

I mean, they look very, very similar, but I prefer a buttercream frosting of some sort on a cake normally.

But so you don't like this?

I haven't tried it yet, but I'll definitely, I will take a look as long as there's, can you cut me a piece that doesn't have too much glue in it?

No, I just, I mean, I have to sort of spread all over.

That's a whole point.

I have to do a show if my mouth is glued together.

Unfortunately, this super long podcast is not going to end.

Well, it's not going to glue your mouth together.

Just make things a little, you'll be chewing on your words a little bit more.

I mean, I think it could be good for you, honestly.

I'll have a, I'll have a go here.

Take a slice.

Here you go, Scothenay.

Couldn't be worse than an English muffin, certainly.

Eaten.

Yeah, take a bite.

Go on, take a bite.

Eat the whole thing.

And if it tastes like toilet drain cleaning solution, don't worry about that.

That's an aftertaste.

Put some in there.

That's an aftertaste.

If it tastes a little bit like Drano and Clorox bleach alternatives.

All three of those?

This glue is making it very, very hard to chew.

I know.

So it lasts longer, doesn't it?

Isn't that nice?

A little too long.

Normally I want to at least have swallowed one, one bite.

No, I happened to bring a print out of your life insurance policy.

You have one, right?

I printed one out.

I Googled Scott Ockerman's life insurance policy.

What am I doing online?

I got to take stuff down.

You know, now, now.

Yes.

This is ringing some bells for me because you haven't been on the show.

Ding dong.

The witch is dead.

Right.

So I got it right.

Ringing bells.

That you, by the way, very gluey.

Oh yes.

Super gluey.

So gluey you don't know what hit ya.

The last time you were on the show.

Yes.

I recall something about you.

Your family was all...

Natural causes.

They were all of, as you put it, fully grown, which means they were not growing any longer because they're dead.

That's right.

So...

That's a British phrase.

I didn't come up with that.

That's a British phrase.

So they're all fully grown in the ground and you were the beneficiary of some of their life insurance policies?

Yeah, I guess so.

I guess I was.

And you were trying to get us to eat some of your things?

Oh, I'm just saying, I would!

You don't like dessert!

I bring you a dessert and you don't like it.

I know you don't have to eat it, I suppose, if you don't want to.

I have to say, if you're trying to poison me, why not make it delicious?

Why use the glue and the old milk duds?

Seems like you could change your MO a little bit to actually, you know, trying to tempt people.

Change my MO?

I hardly know her.

That's in the structure of a joke, but it doesn't actually make sense when you think about it.

Oh, perhaps you're right.

Oh, bad Eugenia!

Naughty girl!

I'm a naughty, naughty Eugenia.

Oh!

You were surprised by that one too!

I always forget that I slap myself.

Eugenia.

Yes?

I'm going to spit out this cake.

No, please, Swallow It, please!

Oh, no!

The guy's hanging down because the glue is attached to my bottom lip, as Bill Cosby once said.

Oh my gosh.

Oh no!

Oh, don't, well, we'll see.

Oh, don't, well, promise me you'll eat some later, please.

I know you have a show to do now, but later when you're in bed and you're PJs.

I'm not going to promise this because you're trying to poison me, obviously, and I haven't even, like, well, you're not the beneficiary of my life insurance.

What?

I thought after we, I thought after we had our last meeting, you were, you agreed to make me your beneficiary.

You can't even pronounce it, let alone be it.

I can too!

Be-ficiary.

Look.

What?

Eugenia.

What?

Are you hard up for cash?

What's going on in your life?

Yes.

What is happening, Eugenia?

I know you were fired from the show.

Well, I was fired from the show, but I also invested in some energy drinks, and I think it was actually a pyramid scheme.

Oh, no, what was the name of the energy drink?

Blast Away!

That has some serious connotations for your butthole.

I don't want, if I'm drinking something, I, yeah, I don't want to think of Blast Away.

I never thought of it as my energy level will blast away like Huff and T How did you get 10 billion?

My husband was a country doctor.

Oh, that's right.

What was his deal?

He was a country doctor.

He did it all.

He did, uh, ears, nose, throat, ears, nose, throat, hats, pants.

Belly buttons.

Wow.

Everything.

Eyeballs.

So you invested all of your money in this Blast Away energy drink.

Yes, and then I lost it also.

And it was a pyramid scheme?

It was a pyramid scheme.

You know, it was all money to build a pyramid, and I didn't, I didn't realize that all this money was- This is recent pyramid news.

Oh my goodness.

Where was this pyramid?

Geezer.

They have too many there.

Well, exactly.

And then they built a pyramid out of, with the money I gave them.

So they did build a pyramid.

They built the pyramid.

Well, yeah, and then they destroyed it.

Why?

Because there's too many there.

So what is the end game for them to get all of this money from investors?

Where does the energy drink even come into it?

Well, so the whole idea was, I, I have an energy drink.

Are you with me?

You came up with the idea for the energy drink?

Well, no, no, no.

I'm just telling you.

Those, the pictures I had it.

I have an energy drink.

Okay.

Let's say, let's just say, are you with me?

I have an energy drink.

I have one energy drink.

I have to hire three friends to also have an energy drink and they hire three for each of them.

To have an energy drink.

This is where I'm getting confused.

Where does, how does one have an energy drink?

Well, we supply, well, they supply it.

You, you get a certain, I should say, you get a sort of, a sort of, a flat of energy drinks.

Right.

And you have to, Oh, you are British.

Yes.

You get, I guess, an apartment for energy drinks.

Thank you for our American listeners.

And you have to sell, you have to then hire or recruit three other, Thank you for dumbing it down.

Hire or recruit or obtain three other people to also, they, and they also get a flat of energy drinks and they have to hire other people to sell them.

What do you do with your flat of energy drinks?

You can drink it or whatever.

This is the part of the plan that is now making sense to me.

Everyone supplied or given energy drinks and there's no plan of how to get rid of any of them.

Oh, thank you.

Thank you for the lay person.

Eugenia, this is a bad business plan.

No wonder.

And now all of your money, I lost it.

All of your money is gone and they destroyed the pyramid.

Yes.

And so now I have nowhere to be entombed when I am fully grown.

That was the, so you knew it was going to be a pyramid.

You just wanted to be entombed?

I knew once I found out it was going to be a pyramid.

I was like, get me entombed in there.

And I said it real sassy and I thought it'd be so charming.

I'm so sorry.

Well, you know, when you're fully grown, you know, Bob's your uncle.

Yeah.

Well, yeah, that's a British phrase.

Yeah.

Indeterminate meaning.

Knackered.

Maybe you want to be with your family wherever they reside.

Not a fan?

Take them or leave them.

Yeah.

Well, you left them definitely.

And they left you $10 billion.

Scott, how are you celebrating your anniversary?

I have to know.

Well, I'm having this very large show where all of our old friends are dropping by.

Oh.

Isn't that wild about it?

Why'd you even fucking ask?

Hey, hey, I'm gobsmacked right now.

Please don't smack yourself again.

Look, Eugenia, it's always great to see you.

I mean, how amazing it is to see our old friends dropping by, even the ones who try to kill us.

I know.

Isn't it fun?

Can I just get a quick little John Hancock?

That's an American saying for you.

Just write him.

How do you know who John Hancock is?

This is very suspicious.

No, I know John Hancock.

Your eyes are darting back and forth right now.

Eugenia.

Just take the pin and sign it.

Take the pin and sign it.

You're an American.

Guilty.

I knew it!

How did you know?

The minute you said John Hancock.

Oh, shoot.

Busted.

Bob's your uncle?

Oh, sure.

Oh, dang it.

Where are you actually from, Eugenia?

Cincinnati.

Got tired of packing and unpacking.

Yeah, damn it.

You sniffed me out.

You didn't have $10 billion, did you?

No.

What do you really do for a living?

I make fart noises.

How do you make money from that?

From like apps or for movies?

I've done a lot of Foley for movies.

People aren't farting enough in movies.

Well, exactly.

It was big in the 90s, but...

And you think, you look back at movies and you're like, I cannot think of a single time that I've heard a fart sound in a movie.

Maybe in Casablanca when he's like, play it again, pfft, Sam.

Yeah.

But there's a lot of background fart noises that have to be supplied.

As people are walking and crossing cameras?

Yeah, because that's just natural.

That's like, pfft, pfft, pfft.

Or like pfft, pfft, pfft.

You're really good at it.

Can I just say?

That's I love those.

Give me a big long wet one.

It wasn't as wet as I'd hoped.

You got to warm up.

I know I put you on the spot.

I'm so sorry.

Okay, now you're all warmed up.

Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

No, that was a fart.

That was a fart?

Oh, I misunderstood.

I was a very sick person.

What is your actual name?

Eugenia Wobbles?

Is it?

No, it's Tandy Farts.

Tandy Farts.

And that's how you got into this whole racket?

Yeah, I come from a long line of farts.

Oh.

And is your family still alive and farting, I guess?

Yeah.

My dad runs a truck.

He runs a truck?

Yeah.

He just like turns it on, turns the ignition.

He's a truck driver, however you want to say it.

I've been pretending to be British for so long.

I don't even know how to say it in America anymore.

Well, Tandy, I really feel duped.

I mean, you're one of our favorite guests ever on the show.

And here you come on and you've been lying to me for the approximately one episode that you were on.

More than one?

No, just one.

Just one.

Can I get your signature?

Sure.

Yeah, here you go.

My John Hancock.

I did it.

I got you.

Oh, stop me.

I got you now.

I am Eugenia Wobbles.

You are British.

I am 99 years old and I just happen to know a lot about US history.

Oh, that makes more sense.

Because I went to Hogwarts.

Oh my gosh.

Don't think about it too much.

All right, don't use this signature.

Too late.

I've already faxed it to mine.

Uh.

Barrister?

Yes.

By Solicitor.

General, my Solicitor General.

OK, I don't know what to think of you, but Eugenia or Tandy or.

You'll never know.

I'm a shape shifter.

OK.

She just farted and turned into a snake.

All right.

Well, Eugenia, it's always I mean, it's when I say always great to see you.

I mean, the two times I've seen you.

Yes, it's so nice to see you again.

Thank you for dropping by.

And thank you so much for signing over your life.

Your trust proposal.

That will come in handy from here someday.

All right.

I don't know what you said, but all right.

Congratulations on your birthday.

Thank you and thank you for the cake.

I'm throwing this immediately into the trash.

OK.

All right, Eugenia, we'll see you next time.

OK.

Toodle-oo.

Pop pop.

Wow.

What a wonderful catchphrase from Eugenia on her way out the door.

You got to start saying pop pop more often.

I really like that addition to her canon.

Oh, boy.

So good to see Eugenia.

And this is truly, truly this has been a an emotional experience for me because all of these people that I love and well, I guess I don't love all of them, but I hope that some that I do love drop by eventually.

Well, no, I love half.

I don't even know.

I don't want to get into odds, but.

I mean, I'm not a fan of the show.

I'm not a fan of the show.

The thong area is just total flesh.

Yes, so my ass cheeks are covered, but everything else is free and flowing.

Yeah, and that hole is just, I mean, just open for business.

Huge. It's ready to go.

But, by the way, I also wear long shirts, so you would never know until I want a reveal.

That's right. It's sort of a night shirt kind of situation.

Night shirt. Do the sax solo from Night Court.

Here we go. I'm on Night Court.

Here, coming down.

What?

What's that?

Horatio, how many sax solos do you know?

I know about 400.

Do you care?

I wanted to be a sax master.

Yeah, Careless Whisper.

That's a famous one. You know that one.

And you don't play the saxophone.

Never.

Never because I smoke and my lung capacity is very small.

Those are the only reasons?

I know, well, I also think of blowing.

I'm always thinking I'm blowing an old jazzman whenever I put a horn in my mouth.

That you're actually inflating?

I can't not think about me blowing Satchmo whenever I get a satch horn.

You think old jazzmen have, their genitals are shaped like the instruments they play?

Sure, because of movies or whatever.

Because of movies?

I don't understand that.

You grew up watching these black jazzmen and you're wondering what's going on.

You're like, I wonder if their dicks are like mouthpieces from old decisions.

Oh, that's totally you.

That's totally you.

No, no, not movies. It's totally you and your head.

I've never seen a horn and been like, oh, that's probably a jazzman's penis.

So when you saw old musicians in New York growing up, you never thought about it.

Their penises looked like instruments?

The huge horns they're holding?

Or just the mouthpieces?

Just the mouthpieces. Oh, you mean the, what do they call the parts?

The wind, the wood thing?

It's not the reed.

The reed.

Well, it is a reed actually, but yeah.

But I'm thinking mostly kind of just like the mouthpiece itself.

I don't. I don't see how you could, but I don't.

Speaking of reed, Horatio, you're writing a book I heard.

I am.

And I'm going to read it. What is your book?

It's the Jazz Age.

Oh, wow.

And it's just what I, it's all little scribbling drawings of what I think everyone's penis looked like in the Jazz Age.

So your book is about the exact thing you're talking about?

Almost, except it's, what I'm talking about now is purely a saxophone based conversation.

And this is?

With the other one it's mostly the whole Jazz Age.

This is like every instrument. Okay. So you're widening out the scope.

Oh yeah, everything.

Alright.

There's four, there's three pages just on the zither, which is like a fold, a three out.

It's almost like a, it's like a Playboy centerfold.

Oh, wow.

It goes out three.

It's a thing?

Yeah.

Cool.

What are you, are you writing a book too?

I'm writing a book also. It's just called Normal Penises.

And it's just a picture of what normal penises look like.

Are these drawings or are these just pictures of your own penis?

These are like very 3D. You know those drawings of people that have a lot of dots?

Is it a pop-up book?

It's a pop-up book.

Did you take me out yet? Did you get me out of that book yet?

Did I put you, oh your dick is still in there.

Oh, please take it out.

Why? It's a huge spread. It's gorgeous. And what it is is.

I'm worried if I were to open it up, like a dick would come out in a pop-up book and poke me in the eye.

You're going to make fun of me, but this is the thing we say, keep your mouth closed anytime you open up a page.

Because then it essentially is like, we don't want it to be, but it could be.

Yeah, exactly. Just someone opens a book and it's like, oh.

Well, I don't know, but that's deep throating. There's only like seven pages I could do that.

You should have baby food shoot out of the pages.

What is wrong with you? What is wrong with both of you?

Sorry, you're talking about a penis pop-up book.

No, I'm not. Sir, no I'm not.

And I put life to the genitals and make them, you know, extreme international excretions.

Okay, I'm going to the publisher, hey man, I really like what we got, I love this.

Is there any way for every page of this book we could throw some baby food in there?

Every time someone opens the page, by the way.

Baby food for nourishment or to sell a gag that Jizz is shooting out of a...

Sure, to sell a gag. Is it possible?

Yes. No, it's not.

How would you reload it? I mean, it seems like the ratio just ruined my book.

Every book comes with a bottle.

And a pump? So you have to do it yourself?

And you have to attach the pump through a little plastic rubber line that goes right into the book.

This sounds like a lot of work. I don't like to do that much work when I'm reading.

I like to open a book, I like the pop-up things to come out, and then I like to be done with like three of them.

Every single book is a pop-up book.

I like to open a book, I like the pop-up book to come out.

I like to go, wow, look at that, look how big that pop-up is.

I like to have no food perishable items come out of the books, and I like to put it down.

Well guys, thank you so much for coming on my 10th anniversary. Did you know it was my 10th anniversary?

I can't believe it. No, is it?

Happy anniversary.

Decade long.

Happy anniversary.

Ten years.

Happy anniversary.

360 times ten.

Happy anniversary.

You left out a bunch of weeks.

Scott, thank you so much for having us.

Oh my gosh, thank you so much for dropping by. It means the world to me.

And we can stick around.

No, I'll see you at the first episode of next year.

Alright, thanks guys.

Alright, really fun to see you.

Keep pumping out the jams.

Oh, and by the way, pump out the jams.

Long time listener.

Long time listeners.

Long time contributor.

Never time listener, 25 time talker.

Really excited for you to pump out the jams.

ratio, do you have anything else you want to plug?

This is it, we're not plugging.

Just the bag.

Oh, just the blag. Just the blag.

By the way, we've been having a lot of trouble with our plugs theme.

Do you want us to give you a quick one for the tenth anniversary?

Maybe we can switch now? I mean, we're halfway through the year.

Maybe we can switch to something new.

Give me something new.

Alright.

And this is to open up the plug bag?

This is to close up.

So it should have nothing to do with opening the plug bag.

Okay, shall I start?

Sure, yeah.

Okay, so this is to close, by the way.

To close the bag.

I'm happy we can do this on the tenth anniversary.

Okay, thank you. Here we go.

Closing up the bag.

Okay, here we go.

Don't let any air in.

Close it up your heart by you.

Open up the bag.

Close your heart.

Open up the bag.

Open up your heart.

Open up the bag.

Open.

The bag.

Wow.

That was pretty good.

I mean, it's definitely shorter.

I will give you that.

We're not done.

And then closing up it goes.

But then you open up your bag.

Talking, close it.

Gotta open it.

You gotta.

You gotta open it.

Gotta close it.

Gotta open it.

Close it.

Gotta open it.

Close it.

Open up the bag.

Wow.

Thank you so much, guys.

I don't know that we'll be switching that.

Maybe we'll alternate between them.

Horatio took off his earphones.

Yeah, he's out of here.

He was so certain we were done.

Oh, I'm done.

We did a great job, you guys.

All right.

Thank you so much, guys, for coming by.

So fun to be here.

Always.

Okay, guys, we'll see you later.

Oh, so good to see them.

It's so wonderful that those two guys appear together on the first episode of Comedy Bang Bang every single calendar year.

First episode in January.

For the past four, five, six years.

I don't even know.

But such good guys.

So great to see them.

And, you know, we're getting really close to the...

Hey!

Hey, who's approaching?

How's it going, babe?

Oh, my goodness.

Someone from the British Isles is here?

That's right.

I just wanted to say, say, say hello.

How's it going?

It's Mal McCartney from Britain.

Wait, Mal McCartney?

Mal McCartney.

We're having our favorite guests on the show.

Frequent guests.

As I recall, you were on one episode.

227?

Uno episode.

Brolo.

In the middle of our fourth year or fifth year, somewhere in there.

Yes, somewhere in there.

Thank you.

I haven't seen you in so long.

Mal McCartney from...

Well, it's been quite a long time, baby.

Yeah, I've been going to a lot of malls.

I've been up on the show.

You've been listening to every single episode?

Really good stuff.

Yeah.

Thank you so much.

Always nice to meet a fan.

And I unlocked the secret ones.

That's right.

We put out secret ones.

Just for our richest, most exclusive guests.

Yeah, baby.

Yeah.

And the one you made just for me was so great.

Look, we love you, Mal McCartney.

The one about British malls?

Yes.

Someone's taking my picture you can't see at home because it's radio.

Hey there.

All right.

Wow.

You are so photogenic, Mal McCartney.

Thank you.

I was the cute one in the band I was once in.

You've had a lot of work done though, if you don't mind me saying.

I have.

Yeah.

I wanted to look like an old lady.

I said, I went to the plastic surgeon.

I said, make me look like an older bird.

And he chopped it up, took out the silicon gun and squirted it in, put it in the caulking gun, squirt, squirt, nub, nub, pinch, pinch, cut, cut, so, so.

And I looked like this.

At what point with plastic surgery will they get to the point where it's like, wow, you look just like you did when you were 30.

Because otherwise it just looks like, oh wow, you look like you're 80 with plastic surgery.

Yeah.

Well, there's like two years there where your face is just big.

Everyone's face is very big and then it settles down and you kind of get this like, yeah, it's like a, it's, it's, it looks nothing like you, but it looks weird.

And like, yeah, it's like a CGI version or something.

Yeah.

Well, Mal McCartney, let's, let's catch up.

As I recall the last time you were on, you're of course, you were in the Beatles.

Yes, Beatles.

And, but primarily you're interested in specific stores and malls or just malls in general?

Oh, malls in general.

I like a Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh, babe.

When I played Ross Park, when I played Pittsburgh, I go to the Ross Park Mall.

I love when I come out here, babe, I love the Glendale Galleria.

Oh, really cool mall.

I like to vibe in the Zara, even though it's girls' clothes.

You can bring pets into any store there.

You can bring pets into any store.

They can just take dumps right there in the middle of the store and people have to laugh and go, ha ha ha, it's fine.

I encourage them to.

Yeah, I can do whatever I want because I'm so famous.

I mean, your pets can do that.

Your pets can do that.

You are literally taking dumps in stores.

I could, I could do whatever I want, including take a dump or kill someone because I am actually so famous that no one will bother me.

I've tried it and I've never killed someone, babe.

You've never killed someone, babe?

No, I've never killed someone as a babe.

I've never killed a babe.

Have you ever killed like a pig?

I tried to date her.

I killed a pig.

You mean a cop or a pig?

Either.

I'll take either.

Yeah.

No, but I don't mind a little bakey bakey in the morning.

I like some scrummy muffies.

I thought that you were a vegetarian or am I confusing you with Paul McCartney?

I don't know who that is, babe.

I, uh, no, no.

Because it seems to me like you're a cross between Paul McCartney and someone who likes malls and Austin Powers.

Well, I'm a meat vegan.

I'm a Megan.

Oh, vegan.

I only eat vegan fake meat.

Oh, I see.

So no plant, no.

Yeah.

You can catch me at, you know, little pine, you know, chopping up some faken or fake chicken as long as it's vegan, you know, but I only eat fake meat.

Like I'm not, you don't catch me eating no kale.

Got it.

Even though it is vegan, it's not Megan.

It's not Megan.

I got it.

Tell me about these malls.

Like, what do you like to do when you go to a mall?

Oh, I go to a nice mall.

I live in a mall.

You know, my LA residency.

You live in a mall?

My LA residency is the Americana.

I live in the Americana mall on Brandon Glendale, California.

Is that the mall that you were saying that you like going to or you like going to the I live there.

I like this so much that I got a little because you said you like going to the Glendale Galleria, which is the hop, skip and a jump, isn't it?

So why do you live in Americana if you like going to the Glendale Galleria?

Well, we've got apartments at the Americana, don't they?

That's a good point.

And I love going there, you know, because it's like a different, it's a change of pace.

The air conditioning's on and air conditioning is on at the Americana, but you have to understand most of it's outside.

So if you want an indoor shopping experience was a big part of malls.

A big part of why?

Because I'm old, babe.

I'm 73.

You know, so you're I think you're a little older than that if I had to guess.

I could be 83.

You could be anything.

We have no idea.

I'm having a little over, you know, I'm getting a little dementia.

You have a senior moment.

I might be having a senior moment.

Yeah.

Look, you were one of the Beatles, obviously.

Yeah.

Can you see?

I said, if you remember the 60s, you weren't even born then.

Can you sing us one of your famous songs?

I mean, I know we have John Lennon on the show sometimes.

Do you know John?

Oh, Johnny.

Of course.

Yeah.

A genius.

He's not too into malls.

May he rest in peace.

He's dead.

No, he's back.

Well, maybe I shouldn't be telling you this.

Yeah.

He's he came back to life.

Is that real?

He doesn't want anyone to know this.

Oh, but he spent five years dead and then he was just like, I'm kind of sick of this.

So he came back to life, but he doesn't like people to know it because he doesn't want Yoko to ever find out.

Oh, well, he's trying to avoid Yoko.

Well, he borrowed her beret.

She might do a piece of performance art about her.

Yeah, yeah.

He borrowed her beret and doesn't want to give it back.

Rebirth and forgiveness.

Exactly.

Anyway.

Sing us one of your hits.

John refuses to sing anytime he's on the show.

Well, John?

John Lennon.

John Lennon, the person we were just talking about.

Yeah.

Thought he was dead.

Wasn't dead.

He's not dead.

But.

Don't use that information and give it to Yoko.

No, no, no.

I, I, I, um, not.

Yeah, I am friends with friendly with her.

I asked, I asked her to break up the Beatles.

You did?

I bet you.

Why would you do that?

I was like, please break us up.

Was it take the fall, babe?

Because I wasn't one with all the problems, you know, like, but I was like, you know, people want to, you know, people already kind of like, who the fuck are you?

Was it mall related?

Your reason to break up?

Because it seems to me like a lot of your motivation has to do with malls.

We were the one to remind you of this.

The Beatles in any way, but we didn't tour a lot, you know, and Shea stadium.

And then you were out.

Yeah, we were out.

So my personal access to malls was extremely inhibited in the Beatles to the point of absurdity, you know?

And when we, when we went to visit Maharishi, you know, in, uh, in, in India, you know, I, I spent, I didn't even hang out, you know, I went to the mall, Horishi, um, the Horishi mall.

Oh, the over there in India.

Yeah.

Horishi mall.

And, um, it was really great.

And they have, uh, everything they have here, which is very cool.

Jeans West.

They have a jeans West American Eagle love that stuff.

Orange Julius, Orange Julius, Wetzel's pretzels and an Annie's right around the corner, depending on what, how dense the garlic powder salt that you want sprinkled all over it.

So you can get diarrhea, um, and, uh, then I wash it down with a nice Cinnabon and of course, wash it down with a Cinnabon wash it down with a Cinnabon and then an Orange Julius for dessert.

It's all healthy.

Orange Julius.

It's like you would flip flop those, but you might as well call it fart juice, baby.

You know, baby.

Sing us one of your famous Beatles songs.

Um, when I gapped to the bottom, my gap to the top of the slide and a stop and a turn and the gap I like, I like men's and women's clothes with a thing in the middle.

Yeah.

That's one of them.

Beautiful.

Paul McCartney with busting out one of his Beatles hits.

Yeah, that was a Beatles hit.

I got another one planned.

Um, you have another one planned.

Well, please like let's put that plan into action.

Hey, Julius, you're really orange.

Take a normal drink and make it sweeter.

The minute you mix that milk and the orange flavors together, you have orange Julie, Julie, Julie, Julie.

Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

Change right here.

Nah, nah, nah, nah.

Orange Julius.

It's just what you thought it was going to be.

Oh wow.

Paul McCartney.

No wonder you're one of our favorite guests.

Absolutely.

You know, um, I want to mole your hand.

So violent, you know?

Well, that's M-A-U-L.

Yeah, M-A-U-L, but it's M-A-L-L in the song because it's all mole stuff.

Sure.

Yeah.

But still, when one hears it, it's a very violent imagery.

Yeah.

Oh yeah, absolutely.

Yeah.

And then you got, of course, Brookstone on the run.

Brookstone on the run.

This is a fan mixed with a thermometer.

What the fuck is it?

It's Brookstone on, and Brookstone is on the run, babe.

Because I think they might be closing it down.

They're going chapter 11.

Really?

They might be chapter 11.

Yeah, they're flying a drone to deliver the message.

They ran out of battery.

Most mall stores seem to be closing down.

You go to more malls than I do, but anytime I go to one, it seems like there's maybe a Lids kiosk and then just a whole bunch of, you know, closed for business signs.

Oh yeah, absolutely.

Sometimes you got a Pacific Coast, you know, nice little kiosk there.

And like the Glendale Galleria, I don't know if you've been there lately, but they've got a great Scientology kiosk where they actually have, no joke, they have the paddles there that you put your hands on to get an E-meter.

The E-meter, really?

Oh yeah.

Oh my gosh.

Oh yeah, it's all right there.

So, wow, what about Sunglasses Hut?

Sunglasses Hut is definitely there.

You got the Lenscrafters.

Lenscrafters, yeah, anything that covers your eyes, it's there.

Yeah, you can go to the mall.

I'll stock up and get like a fart machine from Spencer's, go into Spencer's.

Spencer's is still around, I'm surprised.

You got Hot Topic, you got Spencer's, there's like a game where you end up fucking your friends.

And that's the ideal outcome of the game.

I mean, that's the ideal outcome out of anything.

Honestly, it's been the ideal outcome out of this show and no one has ever chosen to fuck me after it.

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

I mean, that could be for other reasons.

Stinky smell hat emoji.

Hey!

I'm hip, I use emoji jokes and say, LOL, whatever, man.

Maybe you should change your name to Emoji McCartney.

Oh yeah?

Maybe you should change your name to Rocky Raccoon, baby.

That's a classic Mall McCartney slam.

Yeah, definitely.

And of course you got, you never give me your, what's a mall?

What's a mall?

What's a store?

You're the one who goes to malls.

What's a store in a mall?

You never give me your molly.

Oh no, that's problematic today because of the molly OD's.

Half the people who die from a molly OD.

You're kidding me.

Oh no, never joke.

Never a joker.

Never a joker, always a Jack.

It's a little card joke that doesn't make any sense.

Very little.

You have one more mall song that isn't just, you know, the worst.

Oh, well, you know, see, see, see, it's candy from the C's Candy Shop.

It's not the best candy, but everyone seems to like this candy.

And it's not, it's regional.

So that's not even going to be.

Is C's Candy regional?

I can't tell.

C's Candy I think is regional.

It's not out there in Pittsburgh.

You mentioned the Pittsburgh mall that you really like.

Or Toronto or no, C's Candy is nowhere, baby.

One last question.

Do I make you horny?

Yeah, baby.

Yeah.

Alright, mall.

You make mall, I'm a horny horny.

Well, hey man, this has been real.

This has been great.

This has been the best.

This has been great.

This has been fantastic.

We couldn't have done the show without you, mall.

Yeah, cause I'm the guest, right?

Mall, great to see you.

Great to see you, man.

Take care, baby.

Another baby.

Wow.

Oh, so great.

Whoever could have predicted that mall McCartney would, would return to the show, let alone be on our 10th anniversary, but that's what happens here on Comedy Bang Bang.

Some of the most interesting people drop by and who's this now?

It's me, Rudy.

Rudimentary North.

Rudimentary North, one of our new favorites.

Scott, I am coming in as I'm piping hot.

You are as hot as can be.

My skin is steaming.

I am bubbling over here.

Let me take off these jackets.

Yeah.

Piping hot.

It is a relatively cold day today.

You have steam coming off.

I am going to take these off.

It's important.

This will all make sense in a second.

But Scott, before we get started, we got to get something out of the way right now.

Previously on Comedy Bang Bang.

I am a dirtbag.

I life swapped a guy, took his job at Postmates.

Got fired for Postmates, but punched people in the throat.

I was walking down the street.

Just the other day?

I was walking down the street just the other day.

Scott, I punched him and I absorbed his life force.

Okay.

So currently I am the owner of a California donuts.

Have you ever talked about you absorbing the life forces of these people?

Because as far as I recall, you were also a magical being.

That's not important, Scott.

I mean, yes, I'm a mortal.

You know what?

Wait.

You know what?

I am doing a press conference next week.

I did make a discovery in Egypt.

I discovered an ancient tomb.

Was there a date that you have begotten?

1600.

Oh, cool.

It was 1600, but I can't get into that because it's hard.

The 17th century you've been around?

The turn of the 17th century.

I have the same powers as the Flash.

Every single power?

Yep.

I can phase through stuff.

I would love to experience it.

You want to talk to the speed sports?

Yeah, let me get in there.

Hold on.

Oh my God.

That was amazing.

Yeah.

That was pretty crazy.

That was like three years we were in there.

Go.

Possums.

I got big nuts and if you're going to criticize anything, you got to criticize my guts.

Owner of the donut shop.

God, we had a lot of fun times in there.

That was really fun.

I feel like, I mean, you're my best friend.

I love you, Scott.

For the last three years.

I want to say that I do have a message for the future.

Scott, you should not end the podcast.

Something terrible will happen.

Oh, okay.

Well, I wasn't really close to you.

All right.

Great.

Wow.

You brought your own recap.

Normally you do your own recap.

I just thought it was important that you edited this together.

What did you use?

Pro Tools?

I used Pro Tools, Scott.

Okay.

I contacted one of the employees of this podcast, Scott, and I got all the raw data and I did it myself.

Wow.

Well, you're up as far as I know.

I mean, Rudy North, everything that you just heard.

That's true.

A couple of things I learned.

I mean, we didn't mention that you got a new job.

I did get a new job.

Which when John Lennon was on recently, we sang a little bit of that.

He was definitely confused, if I remember correctly.

Right.

Now, Scott, I'm here because, well...

Well, it's my 10th anniversary.

I would hope that you're here to celebrate.

That's true, Scott.

And I do want to say happy anniversary.

Thank you so much.

But it's your anniversary, Scott.

Scott, I have bad news.

Oh, no.

Regarding yourself or about me?

Regarding myself.

Oh, thank God.

No, you're fine.

Everything's fine.

10th anniversary.

Let's celebrate, baby.

Okay.

Scott, something bad happened to me.

Now, you heard of the previously odd that I said if you ended the podcast, something terrible would happen.

Sure.

And I'm not ending.

This is not the final episode.

That was a misunderstanding, Scott.

Okay.

I think you thought I was talking about the podcast in general.

I was talking about the episode, Scott.

That particular episode.

That's right.

I needed you to stall for another 30 minutes.

Oh, why?

What happens?

Scott, it's very complicated.

I made a deal with the Speed Force.

Look, I can't talk about it right now.

Why?

This is a 10 hour podcast.

Scott.

We have nothing but time.

Scott, I have an announcement to make.

Please.

This is no better place for it.

I got a new job.

You got new job.

I got a new job.

What was your last job?

Do we need a previously odd for that?

My last job was definitely Santa Claus for a little bit.

Yes.

Okay.

I remember that.

So I took that over.

I was there.

There was Christmas trees involved.

Right.

And yeah, the Christmas tree salesman.

Right.

The Christmas tree salesman.

But Scott, I'm the devil now.

The devil himself?

That's right, Scott.

I have been banished to hell because you ended that episode early and now I am the devil.

Whoa.

Normally when people are banished to hell, they suffer there.

No.

I got promoted to devil right away.

You were so good at it.

They banished me down there.

They tried to torture me, Scott.

But let me just tell you something.

I am a famous dirtbag.

Right.

Okay.

It's hard to torture a dirtbag.

You can't torture a dirtbag.

Dirtbags torture you.

Exactly.

What a country.

It's like Russia.

I'm like, yeah, I got smeared off of dirtbags.

Now, Scott, I went down to hell, of course, because you ended the podcast early and I told you- I don't recall.

I don't know what the deal was with me ending it early, but we can't get into it.

I can't get into that, Scott, because it has to do with my parents and being wizards and stuff like that.

Okay.

Now, I was down in hell.

First of all, I was walking down hell.

Just the other day.

Of course.

I ran into a demon and I knew what to say.

You knew what to say at this point.

So things are already off to a great start.

So I knew what to say.

I basically said, hey man, what was that up there?

Because they always look it up because hell's underground.

Right.

Sure.

So the only view is up there.

So can you see clouds?

Can you see heaven from hell?

Oh yeah.

Okay.

You got to see through earth.

Yeah, but it's up there.

You need like a heaven.

Everyone has x-ray vision.

It's called a heaven scope.

Heaven scope.

It's a telescope for the heavens.

And it just goes right through the earth.

Straight through the earth.

All the way through.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

I got those down there at the Griffith Park Observatory.

Yeah.

Where do we see it?

Is it sticking up out of the ground somewhere in two places on earth that are equidistant from each other?

Scott, you know a lot about these heaven scopes.

I'm just guessing at this point.

You're very good at guessing, Scott.

That's one thing that I think has bonded us through the years.

And of course we are best friends.

You've been on the show for approximately two years.

I have.

But you know, Scott, maybe less.

Now, Scott, now of course I punched this demon in the throat.

Oh, of course.

But you said, hey, what's that?

I said, what's that up there?

He looked up.

I punched him in the throat, Scott.

Pushed him in the throat.

Took his pitchfork.

Pitchforked him in the butt.

Of course.

Is that a usual part of the process?

No, but I did want to- Using whatever tool that they have to poke him in the butt?

Sometimes you turn things around and I don't normally punch people in the butt, but I do remember- When you own the donut shop, did you poke someone in the butt with a donut or- I think I used a hose to maybe spray someone in the face.

Okay, sure.

And when I was a leaf blower guy, I definitely leaf blowed things into people's faces.

You don't want to do that up the butt.

I don't want to do that up the butt.

That will terror-rect them.

I mean, what, what?

Now, Scott, let me tell you something about being a demon in hell.

It wasn't good for me.

It wasn't.

This I didn't like because I had a boss.

I had to go to like, you know, I like to be my own boss.

Who's your boss because- The devil!

Right.

If the devil- this is in the beginning, Scott.

Okay, got it.

Before I became the devil.

Before you became the devil.

Now, you know, I like being my own boss.

Yeah.

You're- you like to be self-employed.

Self-employed.

I drove an Uber because the car was the boss.

Right.

Is there a lot of bureaucracy down in hell?

Oh, my- let me tell you something.

First of all, the devil is a little bit of a bitch.

Okay, Scott?

Okay.

I'm telling you.

And this guy- and this dude, look, he loves talking shit.

He loves talking shit, Scott.

Well, I mean, it's the devil, you know?

I mean, I'm sure he's rewarded for that kind of behavior.

Oh, my God.

He rewards himself.

Every time he talks shit, he picks up a Hershey Kiss and he eats it.

That shit melts in his head before he gets it himself.

He slurps it out of his mouth.

He should have like a refrigerator down there.

He's an idiot.

Are they not allowed down there?

He doesn't like cool stuff.

Right.

He likes hot stuff.

He likes it plenty hot.

Yeah.

It's pretty annoying for me, but as a dirtbag, I've adapted, of course.

Right.

And, you know, I didn't like having a boss.

So the devil called me in on a meeting and he said, Rudy, Rudimentary North, we've been doing a report on your efficiency as a demon.

And I'm like, motherf- this motherfucker.

I reach over to try to get a Hershey Kiss.

He slaps the top of my head like a, like a, you know, like I'm doing something wrong.

Right.

Sure.

Yeah.

And I said, you know what, devil?

It's time for the Rudy North takeover.

And he says- You gave him a warning.

This is the first time I've ever given a warning.

Wow.

I've never given a warning, but this was the devil.

So I needed to just play him.

Right.

Yeah.

And I said, I said, you're about to get a Rudy North special.

And he said, because he doesn't, you don't understand that language.

Oh, okay.

He's, is he constantly speaking demons?

Yeah.

Some sort of ancient primordial language?

He's speaking demon.

Yeah.

He's speaking demon, which again is just broken English.

Okay.

But- You can translate to- You can translate.

What he basically said was, look, I'm going to have to file a report.

And as soon as he said that, Scott, I reached over his desk.

I punched his ass in the throat.

Wow.

You know, as my best friend, I taught you to move.

Sure.

Yeah.

That's exactly what you do.

And I punched him in the throat and well, he now bows down to me.

He bends the knee.

He bends the knee, Scott.

So you- That's right.

Now I'm the devil.

So you swapped jobs.

You did a job swap.

Yes.

So now he's just a demon.

Now you're the devil.

Exactly, Scott.

And all the other jobs I've had, I did not enjoy, Scott.

Well, you don't have a boss as the devil unless I guess some people would think that God or Jesus is the boss of the devil.

But- What did you say?

Well, there are some schools of philosophy that think that the devil, you know, is technically being guided and given orders by heaven.

Okay.

Okay, cool.

Cool.

Okay.

So you've seen God at some schools, have they ever checked in with you?

No, no, no.

I haven't seen God in a while.

I guess I have seen some memos.

You've seen God before though?

Yeah, I saw God.

Yeah, I saw him.

Well, so first of all, they have a fun, like on Halloween, they have a God heaven party.

Which is very fun.

And does hell have a hell party?

Well, they mix it up.

It's like, it's a God heaven hell party is what I meant to say.

Oh, I see.

So everybody, we get to, we meet on earth.

Okay.

That's right.

Mutual ground.

Oh yeah.

We hang out at the Ace Hotel and we have a fucking great time, Scott.

We party.

I mean, Tupac was there.

Tupac was there.

Wow.

Biggie Smalls was there.

I mean, John Lennon and I were talking about the famous dead musicians who, you know, who would be in a band together.

Yeah.

It's crazy.

I saw so many.

Yeah, do those guys rap together?

Oh yeah, they rap together.

Yeah.

But one's in heaven and one's in hell.

Wait, which one?

Scott, I'm not able to tell.

I only saw him at the party.

You're not at liberty to say?

I saw him at the party, so it's like, I didn't ask.

Well, you're the devil.

You probably accessed that information.

Yeah, you're right.

But you know what?

I don't go into the paperwork room.

You know how I do things, Scott.

Yeah, total dirt bag style.

Total dirt bag style.

Just flying by the seat of your pants.

Kick my feet up, flying by the seat of my devil pants.

Did you poke the devil in the butt with his pitchfork?

Oh yeah, Scott.

I'm constantly doing it.

I hooked him up to like a fucking machine that just is a bitchfork.

Where'd you get the fucking machine?

I bought it online.

Now Scott, I'm so happy that I'm the devil now.

And you know.

I'm happy for you.

This is incredible.

Thank you, Scott.

But the sad part and the bad thing I needed to tell you is that this is the last time I can appear on the podcast.

What?

No, you're one of our favorite guests of the past two years, if that.

Yeah, if that.

Now Scott, I am so sorry, but I really had to fight to leave hell today to do this.

You, well, you're your own boss.

They don't let you leave hell whenever you want.

But with every second I'm on side of hell, my power grows weaker, Scott.

Oh, I see.

Just like the DC Comics devil himself.

I think they got a devil character.

They probably do.

I know Marvel has Mephisto.

Hellboy.

Something like that, who knows.

Yeah, sure.

Now, I'm definitely like that.

You're like that.

That's right, Scott.

So I'm sorry.

Your power is being drained away as you speak to me.

That's right.

And you don't want to lose that power.

I don't want to lose that power, Scott.

Because someone could throat punch you.

That's true, Scott.

And right now my speed force is almost at a zero.

And my devil force.

That's hell related because.

No, that's just different.

I haven't used it in a while.

Hmm.

Speed force.

Scott, I can't get into that right now.

We don't have time.

I don't know all the rules of all your various powers.

You know, you did hang out with me for three years in the speed force, but I guess you didn't pick up on it.

You know how memory works.

That's true.

You forget things the further away you get.

That's right.

It's been a long time.

I should have left you.

We're not a dope.

Of course not.

Scott, thank you for that.

I appreciate it.

That's good.

I'm so sorry, but this is the last time I was down there, by the way.

Well, I must say she is not OK.

She's in heaven.

She made it all the way up there.

Good for her.

I wouldn't, I wouldn't want her to be strapped to a fucking machine.

No, hell no.

She's not an R Kelly related.

She's no, no, no.

She's up there.

And as a matter of fact, she is the person perpetrating most of the revenge on R Kelly right now.

Good for her.

She's the guardian angel of everyone, you know, so she's having fun.

Oh, good.

OK, I'm glad she landed on her feet or her wings or whatever it is.

And you know, you know what she always says, at first you don't succeed.

Pick yourself up.

To try again.

Yeah.

So Scott, and now, first of all, I feel bad because even just saying the word Scott, I like saying Scott.

No one's going to be saying Scott as much as you anymore without you being on the show.

There's going to be an absence of the word Scott.

It really is.

Because it's a...

You don't say the word Scott as much as you say it.

I'm sad, Scott.

I'm sad, too.

That's why I was coming in so piping hot.

You were so piping hot and now you're going to be leaving me cold.

And I know the fans are going to be so sad.

I think they will be.

I mean, you're one of our favorites.

As a fan favorite.

Yeah, fan favorite.

Self-described fan favorite.

Of course, but self-fulfilling prophecy.

Scott, I'm so sorry.

So you know, thank you.

This is a real bummer for me.

It's a real bummer for the fans, but thank you for having me.

And look, there's no way that in some convoluted turn of events, I might appear again in the future.

I doubt there will be ever a way because you have a lot of responsibilities of the devil.

The good news is, is you'll be seeing several of our fans down there as they expire.

That's true.

Pass on.

That's true.

Yeah.

Is there anything... can they give you a Hae-Nong man or something like that to let them know that they're a fan of yours?

I'll tell you what.

If you come down to hell and you give me a quick Hae-Nong man.

How quick?

It's gotta be like this.

Hae-Nong man.

Just like, and very kind of up your breath.

Very quiet, because I don't want the other demons to hear it.

Right?

Because I can't be giving all these favors away.

Right.

I will turn the pitchfork fucker machine down to low.

Okay, well that's very nice of you.

That's the low.

Because I want CBB fans...

How many thrusts is it on in low per minute?

That's like 10 per minute.

Okay, every six seconds.

That's not bad at all.

Okay.

I'll turn the light massage.

It might be good.

Look, it's not gonna be hot.

You're gonna be burned up.

Sure, yeah.

All the rest.

Turn the pitchfork fucker machine down to...

Because I love comedy bang bang, Scott.

Well we love you.

We're gonna be so sad that you're not with us anymore.

I know, and it's just been so great to be a part of the canon and just sort of like add as much as I can every appearance I make and I'm just...

just thank you, Scott.

It's been my pleasure.

I mean, Rudy.

You're one of my best friends.

Formerly my best friend and then time...

You know, time, you know, we drift.

It's like we got out of college, but we had our time.

Always go back to that time.

Yeah, of course.

You know, before Thanksgiving we'll always be a part of it.

Always, yeah.

I'll always celebrate it.

You know, and those recipes we've had.

We don't have time to get into those.

We don't have time to get into that, Scott.

But of course, Scott, one thing I wanted to say was I did not ever get into my discovery in that ancient Egypt tomb.

That's right.

We've always wanted to know.

Yes.

Do we have time to get into it right now?

I think we might have time to get into it, Scott.

We're doing a very long show, so I think we do have time.

Scott, the discovery I made in that tomb in ancient Egypt was a bunch of Pop-Tarts, Scott.

Pop-Tarts?

That is right.

Like modern Pop-Tarts?

You discovered them, someone left them there recently?

That's right, Scott.

And of course that was evidence of time travel in ancient Egypt.

Oh, I see.

A time traveler went backwards in time and left them.

Oh my God.

And it was evidence of an enemy who's been hunting me down since, well, the very beginning of time.

Oh, since the beginning of time?

Yes.

I mean, you were sired in the 1600s.

It's true.

But of course my life force has been around since the beginning of time because of this.

I don't know the rules on this.

You've never explained them.

Well, the speed force loop, I can't get into it, but the lightning bolt was me from the beginning.

Okay.

But Scott, well, that enemy, well, there's evidence of that enemy.

And now that I'm in hell, well, there's room for this enemy to run free, Scott.

Now that you're not safeguarding earth, which is something I'm presuming that you did.

Yeah, that's part of my- Those were some of your responsibilities.

That's canon.

Okay.

Now that you're not safeguarding earth, this enemy is running free?

That's right, Scott.

This enemy is my daughter.

Your daughter?

That's right, Scott.

My d-d-d-d-daughter.

Who's your daughter?

Judy North.

Judy North?

That's right, Scott.

Beware of Judy North.

She may come in the form of another comedic character.

You will never know, Scott.

You will never know.

Rudy, don't go.

Ah!

You're out in a hornet's tail and- Ah!

Ah!

Speaking the ancient Aramaic language.

Goodbye, Scott.

Goodbye, Rudy.

Goodbye.

Oh, he closed the door.

I think that it was a smoke bomb to disguise his exit.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Hi, hello.

My name's Judy.

Oh, hello, Judy.

Uh...

Judy North.

Wait a second, that's ringing sort of a bell for me.

Uh-huh.

I'm trying to remember why...

Well, I'm a dirtbag, Scott.

Why have I heard that name before?

Judy North.

Well, um, you might have heard of it because I was just the CEO of Starbucks.

Oh, right!

That's right, Judy North.

Judy North!

CEO of Starbucks and nothing else.

Oh, yeah, Judy North.

That's so- yeah, I guess you've been in the news really for president or something?

I might be running for president.

Oh, okay.

Well, it's great to meet you, Judy.

It's great to meet you too, Scott.

Doing a little 10th anniversary podcast here.

Very cool!

And happy anniversary, Scott.

Thank you so much.

I'm very happy for you.

Having a lot of old friends on the show, but it's always nice to meet a new friend.

Well, I'm so happy to be a new friend here, Scott.

Judy North.

That's right, Judy North.

Well, great.

Are you just gonna hang out or...

Yeah, I guess so.

I might just hang out.

Okay, cool.

Cool!

Alright, well, so, I guess do I just write my name on the table?

Yeah, yeah, do.

I mean, you're one of our new friends here on the show.

Future fan favorite, Judy North!

Open door policy here.

Anyone can come in.

Someone we've never seen before.

Has never been mentioned on the show previous to this.

Never!

Well, Judy, can I ask you some questions about yourself?

Well, of course, Scott.

How old of a woman girl?

Well, she's very rude to ask a woman her age, Scott.

Oh, and it's the first question I asked.

I apologize.

How rude!

I'm Judy North!

You are Judy North, yes.

Scott!

Uh, uh, uh, you don't want to tell me that.

Scott!

You're saying my name a lot.

A lot like, uh, you're saying my name a lot.

A lot like someone I used to know.

Scott!

Yeah, that's my name.

Scott, you do.

Uh, yeah, I used to have a friend.

I'm sort of forgetting about it a little bit.

I used to have a friend who said my name all the time.

Oh, cool.

Was he a genie or something?

I never really quite figured that out.

He might have been.

Do you know what friend I'm referring to?

No, Scott, I've never been here before.

Have you listened to the show though?

I mean, the show travels.

Oh my God, huge fan, huge fan.

Okay, then that must be...

But I skipped a bunch of very specific episodes.

Oh, okay.

So, you know.

Over the past...

Two years or so.

If that...

Yeah, yeah.

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Well, anyway, Scott, I'm so happy to be here.

Wow, I'm happy to have you.

I mean, we may have to get on with the show here.

No problem, Scott.

I do want you to move on.

But one thing I do want you to remember is that Judy North will always be here for you.

Well, thank you, Judy.

I would love to have you back on the show as many times as you would like to be on.

Of course.

We have a lot of absences at this point.

Yeah, a lot of people don't show up and I do live very close.

So hit me up.

Okay, yeah, I definitely will.

How do I...

I don't have any of your information.

Do I...

I'm going to talk to one of the engineers.

Okay, great.

You're tight with the engineers or something?

I'm tight with the engineers.

Okay.

Well, Judy, so nice to meet you.

Scott, so nice to meet you too.

We'll be seeing you many times in the future.

Yes, you will.

All right, take care, Judy.

Bye, Scott.

Judy North.

Okay, well, that's going to be very important over the next 10 years, I would imagine.

All right, we need to take a break when we come back.

We'll have more Comedy Bang Bang after this.

Comedy Bang Bang, welcome back.

Scott Aukerman here and we are...

Boy, we are close to the finish line here.

This is our last segment on our incredibly long 10 hour podcast.

World record, World Record Breaker?

I would imagine.

I wonder who previously held this world record.

It was Joe Rogan, probably.

But I am the title holder now until someone probably attempts to do this next week.

But I am so emotional here with so many great people dropping by and this is our last segment.

So hopefully some of our friends are still around who can come by and wish us well and say hello to us.

And who's that rapping at my chamber door?

Scott, how are you doing?

If it isn't John Lennon himself.

They told me at the front desk.

Shut that door behind you if you would.

Oh my goodness.

That's a heavy one.

That is.

Hello, welcome.

The Mad Beetle himself.

May I sit down?

Yeah, please.

Yes, of course.

Thank you so much.

You're so polite.

No, I know I always need to ask.

You've never asked any time you've ever been on this show.

Oh my God.

I thought I always have.

I've got the vampire syndrome with sitting.

You do?

But you're able to enter people's houses.

Right.

No problem.

I'm able to enter people's houses all the time.

Are you doing B and Es in people's houses?

No, because I'm not.

It's all I'll test the lock in the front door.

Okay, so no Bs.

Just Es.

Es Es.

And with Es.

John Lennon from the most famously.

Well, this podcast.

Well, but also before that.

Before that I did a little acting.

I was in a film about World War II.

That's where I got these glasses.

Right.

And a film called Help as I recall.

Right.

Okay.

That was with a bunch of musicians I used to pal around with.

Yes, the European rock group.

The European rock group, The Beatles.

Right.

Yeah, we were great.

Yes, you were.

That's what people mainly would know you from, I think.

From my great album.

Which album?

Well, the one that I love now, The Beatles Won.

Your favorite Beatles record is Beatles Won.

My favorite one.

And I've told people this and I know the record companies and whoever owns the rights to it don't want me to say this.

It's the only record you need.

It's the only Beatles record you should pick out.

It's the only Beatles record you need.

You're right.

Right.

Because it has all of The Beatles number one.

Right.

And only Beatles songs.

Right.

People will come up to me, oh, do you have that Shania Twain song from way back when?

No, we don't really because we weren't recording music when she was, I don't know how to answer that question.

I hate that when you're listening to a band's album and suddenly another band enters and does a few songs.

Right.

You have to, you're checking around the whole sleeve of the CD or the record.

This doesn't say anything about Shania Twain.

How could it?

I was listening to The Beatles.

Well John, welcome to the show.

Thank you so much for dropping by.

Thanks for having me.

Sorry, I got to take a sip of water.

Oh please, yeah.

Oh.

Ooh.

Did you, you brought your own bottle there I noticed.

That's water?

That is water.

H2 and O.

H2 and O in that order.

Well I guess you could mix up the order a little bit as long as there's two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen.

Yeah, I guess in the end it doesn't, it all comes out the same in the end.

And in the end.

Right.

And that's what that song was about.

Was it?

That song was about drinking water and peeing it away.

The love you give is the equal to the love you get.

Sure.

You know, and it's, the love you give is the water you give yourself.

Why did you say it that way?

The love you give.

Are you talking about like ingesting water?

Is that what you mean?

Right.

The water you give to your mouth.

You said it like it was a huge, you know, euphemism.

The love you give.

You're just talking about drinking water.

That's just my voice.

John, thank you so much for coming.

How the hell have you been?

I've been great.

I don't know if you know this, but we're celebrating the 10th anniversary of the podcast.

The receptionist told me.

Oh, you were here just on other business or?

Just to check it out.

I wander by here every once in a while to see if you're around.

Just do some easy ease?

I saw my easy ease at the front door.

I said, they said, Hey, you're Scott's friend.

I said, what is that?

How he refers to me?

That's great.

I guess that's one thing you could be known for other than being in the Beatles.

Your friend?

Yes.

Good.

So yes, it's the 10th anniversary of the show.

That's fantastic.

You've been on for a good five of those probably.

Five of those years.

Yeah.

I don't know.

You'd have to go back and check it out.

No, thank you.

I'm not going to do it either.

Somebody on Reddit should do a thread.

Sure.

Why not?

When did this start?

A whole thread.

How many years have you been doing it?

Right.

And everyone has their own opinion.

A lot like their assholes.

Right.

Speaking of assholes, you are not one.

And you've been a great friend to the show.

Thank you very much for saying it.

Yeah.

I can't believe it.

So 2009 this stuff.

2009, yes, of course.

God, what were you doing back then?

Oh, you're doing this podcast.

I started this podcast.

What were you doing back then?

Back in 2009, I was...

That was Slumdog Millionaire Time.

Oh, right.

Yes.

When they won the Oscar.

Did they win the Oscar then?

Yeah, that was a big one.

They won best picture.

I would imagine.

If they won the big one, yeah.

That's right.

They should call it the big one.

Because nobody calls movies pictures.

Instead of the Oscars, they should call it the big ones.

The big gold boy.

The big gold boys.

Win a big gold boy if you made a movie.

And give a gold boy.

And they should give more too.

Instead of just having one best picture, give out about 50.

Right, because it's all opinion.

Everyone wants one.

It's all everyone's opinion.

Yeah, exactly.

Right.

Make everyone happy in Hollywood.

I'd like to win one.

You should win one too.

I tried to with that movie I did.

Right.

I don't remember the movie you're talking about.

It was the one in the world too.

Yeah, somebody put me in it.

I don't remember it.

It was so crazy back then I don't remember.

Think of it.

Well, yeah, 2009.

I mean, that is, I believe, that is 40 years after you guys broke up the deal.

Yeah, well, we broke them up.

We had to stop.

Yeah, and then it's also, I believe, it's because you were dead for five years.

Let's see, in 1980, I was shot.

In 1984, I came out of the ground.

84 you came out.

So, yeah.

So, we're talking 35 years after you came out of the ground.

Right.

So, it was, yeah, 2009.

Right.

So, what were you doing in 2009?

That was a big year for me.

I was, I mentioned Slumdog because 2009 I always come, I think, of that movie.

Sure.

Because I was involved in a lawsuit with them.

You were?

Well, tangentially, I was a witness to a certain crime.

I don't remember reading this in the trades.

They kept it very hush-hush.

It was, this all happened, started at the Oscar party.

The Gold Boys.

Thank you.

The Gold Boy party.

And we're all having fun.

You were there.

I was there because, you know.

I don't know why no one takes pictures of you.

I mean, I know the fact that you're alive is supposed to be a secret.

I'm a nice guy and I'm always saying, I'm always the guy who says, I'll take it.

That's what it is.

Yeah.

Okay.

No wonder there's no photographic evidence of it.

I'll stop on a red carpet and then go, oh, get out of here.

I used to sit down.

I'll take these.

So, people are like, John, John, John, over here, over here.

And you're like, no, no, no.

Let me take it to you.

Yeah, let me take it to you.

You've had a long day.

Wow.

And I've done nothing here.

So, we're at the party.

You know, all free food.

It was a nice easy for me.

Right.

Because it's not really a door on the party.

It's just kind of an open area.

I'm sure there was a gentleman checking off the list.

Yeah, but he saw me and said, you can come in.

That's exactly how it happens.

You can kindly come in.

Yeah.

So, I walked in and Regis Philbin.

Yes, Philbin.

Yeah, Regis Philbin.

Formerly of the Regis and Kathie Lee show.

And then Regis and Kelly.

Yes.

Right.

And you know, he did the, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

Of course.

So, this is 2009.

So, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is still on the air with him?

I think so.

Maybe.

It's tough to, well, that was part of the trial, which I can't talk about.

Oh, that's the part you can't talk about.

I can't talk about that.

You can talk about this part.

Leading up to it.

Okay.

And Regis was drunk as hell.

Yeah.

And he said, they won this Oscar.

I should have something to do with it.

It was my show the whole time.

They didn't even cast me.

They didn't even audition me.

Oh, that's right.

And they were like, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is all based on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.

Okay.

Now I'm seeing the connection.

And he, I said, you know, cause I'm a rabble rouser.

I said, well, how'd you go up to Danny and say something?

Danny Boyle, the director.

Danny Boyle.

Okay.

And he did.

And it was not nice what he said.

Oh, okay.

Do you recall exactly?

It's the type of thing, you know, I know you like to keep a clean show.

Of course.

Yeah.

It's not that kind of a show.

I can say a few words.

You.

Okay.

I can't say a lot of the next word, you know, budget words.

Right.

Or the preceding word, I would imagine.

Right.

And then, uh, and then did he, did he get your blank hands off of me is the only words I can say.

All right.

Great.

They fought each other and, uh, you know, Danny Boyle had his nose broken.

Uh, really?

Right.

Regis Philman snapped the golden boy in half.

He snapped it in half.

Did they replace it in a situation like that?

He's stronger than you think.

Yeah.

I mean, Regis, he's strong as an ox.

I would imagine.

Look at him.

Right.

So he's stronger than that because that's what I think.

Twice as ugly.

All right.

I'm friends with him.

So he's going to hear this and say, well, you're both New Yorkers.

Yeah, we love it.

Well, the three of us, me and him and David Letterman always get on each other.

Oh, always.

Yeah.

I would imagine.

That was most of my ideas for Letterman.

Hey, you know, why don't you go, you know, uh, throw a bowling ball out of, I told him not to do that.

Really?

You're going to break that bowling ball.

That's one of his most famous bits.

He said he didn't care.

I would imagine.

Yeah.

He didn't care about me.

Okay.

So a big fight.

Big fight.

At the golden boys.

I was a witness.

It became a big, uh, you know, lower level, not lower level, under the radar.

Under the radar.

Okay.

So did it get settled or was there a jury trial?

It was settled.

All I can say is money was paid on both sides to me.

On both sides to you?

To make this thing go away.

Okay.

I mean, it seems like Regis was at fault.

Regis was at fault, but Danny Boyle broke his nose.

Danny Boyle broke Regis's nose.

I thought Regis broke Danny Boyle's nose.

Regis did it all.

He broke the nose and snapped the golden boy.

Wait a minute.

Why the hell is Danny not awarded money on the spot?

Yeah.

Why are you getting all this money?

Jesus Christ.

I was getting hush money from everybody.

It was the most corrupt case.

Danny Boyle didn't want anyone to know that Regis Philbin broke his nose.

Right.

It sounds like.

You don't want that word getting around.

Right.

So they, at the trial, they were like, you know what?

This is getting too hot.

Right.

Let's just pay John Lennon some money.

And he made, and I made it go away.

And Regis Philbin, he doesn't want anyone knowing he's snapping, uh, rewards in half.

Rewards.

Awards.

And rewards.

Both.

Does he have an Oscars rewards card?

If you get enough on your rewards card, you get one.

Yeah.

What a wonderful story.

What a life.

What a wonderful story.

What a life I live.

Wow.

Incredible.

It's crazy.

But it's fantastic.

It is crazy and fantastic.

Crazy, fantastic.

Crass-tastic.

If I was still making music.

Right.

Which, by the way, you're supposed to bring your guitar and sing us your new songs at some point.

Did you do that for the 10th anniversary?

This 10th anniversary?

Yes.

No.

Okay.

Will you do it on the next 10th anniversary?

I will on the next one for sure.

But you got to remind me because it takes some time to get the instruments together.

Okay.

I remind you every time you're here.

The strings are at one place.

You got the body is at ring goes.

This is not a difficult situation to solve.

I know.

It shouldn't be.

But I just need the time.

So if you were making music again, what now?

Crazy Fantastic would be a great album title.

It would be.

Okay.

It would be crazy fantastic.

What a wonderful alleyway to go down with you.

What?

That wonderful just supposition of if you were still making music.

If I was making music, I wonder what it'd be.

This is not bad.

Yeah.

New Beatles song.

Is it okay if we call it Beatles or should it just be solo?

Sure.

Cause I'll get the other guys.

You will.

I'll get the old tracks from the dead ones.

Speaking of which, George Harrison, has he decided to come back to life?

No, I think he loves it down there.

He loves it down there.

When you say down there, you mean in the ground.

Not in hell.

No, not in hell.

Okay.

He's probably not in hell.

He's a great guy.

Yeah.

He's up there with the Maharishi.

That's right.

Who do you think, who would be the greatest rock and roll band in heaven?

Well, I mean, I think one of those fictional bands, you know, Stillwater?

Was that who it was from Almost Famous?

Right, right.

They're probably dead.

Right, if they had to make a second one, it would just be all the deaths.

Right.

I don't think the studios would go for that.

Everyone always talks about John Bonham on drums, Jimmy on guitar.

Right.

You know, who's on keyboards?

Well, that would be, so Keith Moon, what does he play?

He's got to jump over to keyboards.

Right.

Wasn't there a dude from the Dave Matthews band who's not with us anymore?

The fiddle player?

He's alive, the sax player.

The sax player.

Get him on sax.

Leroy Moore.

How do you know these things?

I know music and I love it.

You barely know you were in the Beatles.

Barely?

It's not that I barely know, it just doesn't really pop to my brain as quickly.

Well, John, what have you been up to lately?

I haven't seen you in a few, a little while.

Lately?

Let's see.

Well, I tried out for the Mets.

For the New York Metropolitan?

Right.

Yeah, yeah.

Oh my goodness.

You know, that type of joke does not go over well with the Mets.

Right.

We have Mr. Met on the show occasionally.

You did?

Yes.

Well, you know him.

He's the mascot.

The ball, his head is the big ball.

His head, he had an unfortunate experiment where he wanted his head to be the size of a regular baseball.

Oh my God.

And instead it got expanded to the size of a comically large baseball.

Right.

And his whole body's there.

Yeah.

His whole body, everything.

Yeah.

That's terrible.

So you tried out for the baseball team?

I got to try out for the Mets.

Wow.

Yeah.

I'm good at it.

I can hit a lot better than anyone ever thought.

You can really?

You're a power hitter?

I'm not a power hitter, but I can aim it very well.

Oh, okay.

So I can just shoot.

Just drop it right in?

Yeah.

Drop it in, send it away.

Really?

So how did the tryout go?

It went great.

I made the team.

You made the Mets team?

I did very well.

Are you playing with them right now?

Well, no.

I'm a Yankees fan through and through.

Then why try out for the Mets?

Because if somebody comes to you, sees you in the park playing baseball with your friends, and says, you want to try out for the Mets?

No, thanks.

I wouldn't want that life experience.

So you made the team.

Made the team, made a bunch of friends.

You turned... did you ever play one game?

Well, just down in spring training, some of those.

And then your conscience got the better of you, saying you...

Yeah, my conscience, just my team loyalty.

Right.

Did you ever see a Subway series happening where you're like, uh oh, we're going to have to play my favorite team?

I saw a series on a Subway.

Oh, you did?

Right, I saw some rats play.

How'd you get a connection?

Oh, I see.

Pizza rat isn't the only exciting rat down there.

Anything else going on, John?

Yeah, well, I headed...

I got to...

Well, I've got a new job.

I got a new job.

Wow.

I got... well, I got that...

Where's Rudy North when you need him?

No, I've got... well, so this whole thing started with...

I was going to have a venture... a headphone venture, a new project with Dr. Dre.

A new business?

Oh, Dr. Dre, he already has the Beats headphones.

You were going to do a little...

I was going to go in on a project with him.

Okay.

I got to the meeting.

Okay.

Wrong Dr. Dre.

I'm meeting with Dr. Dre from Yo!

MTV Raps.

Oh, from...

The one that co-hosts Dr. Dre.

Yeah, the co... yeah.

There was a lot of confusion back there in the 80s because there were two Dr. Dre's.

What happened there?

I don't...

I think...

I don't know.

It's like the Dust Brothers, you know?

I mean, there were two Dust Brothers for a while.

Really?

One had to change their name to the Chemical Brothers.

Is that true?

That is true, yeah.

I did not know that.

And I thought I knew everything about the Dust Brothers.

Parallel...

Oh, you thought?

Yeah.

Let me test you.

Okay.

Do you remember the song by a band of brothers that they produced?

No.

It's not the band of brothers theme song.

Okay.

You're still... if you still have World War II on the brain.

Okay.

I don't know much about these guys.

It's Hanson.

Oh, Hanson the...

The Mmbop song.

They produced that, yes.

Get out of town.

I will not.

I will stay right here.

You may get out of town.

You may go back to New York if you like.

I will after this.

All right.

I had a meeting with Dr. Dre and sat down and I said, okay, you're not the guy I was thinking of.

But you know, I knew...

I've known him forever.

So we were sitting and chatting.

Who was his co-host?

Ed Lover?

Ed Lover.

Yeah.

Was he there?

He was not there.

I don't know if they hang out much anymore.

Okay.

That may have...

Well, when we put the show together...

It may have run its course.

When we put the show together, it was sort of...

What do you mean when you put the show together?

When I produced Yo!

MTV Raps.

You did?

Yeah.

I had no idea.

You didn't know about that?

No.

Oh my God, yes.

I was working in New York at the time for MTV and I put the show.

I thought...

But you said you were going to be the other Dr. Dre when Dr.

Dre reached out to you, your colleague and co-worker.

This was all through representation and stuff and lost in translation.

And here I am sitting with this...

Oh yeah, MTV Raps.

So instead of saying, oh hey, it's Dr. Dre, my former colleague, you said, you're not the guy I thought you were.

I said, yeah, that's rude.

And I said, I apologize.

But we talked about some of the old days for a little while.

And I put together...

You probably didn't know this then.

I put together Wu-Tang Clan.

You assembled the Wu-Tang Clan.

Some of them were already, some of the guys were already there and I introduced them to Method Man.

You, really?

Yeah.

He's one of the biggest stars.

One of the best.

I gave him his name, his Method Man name.

How did you come up with that?

He was going by Methodical Man.

Oh, okay.

And I said, okay, that's...

It's good, but good is the enemy of great.

The Methodical MC, I'm sorry, that's what it was.

The Methodical MC, okay.

And I said, that's not very good.

First of all, you're not an MC, you're a man.

And, and you've got a method to this, it is madness.

They all agreed.

They all agreed on that?

This Wu-Tang Clan is madness.

It's hip-hop madness.

So they agreed.

When you brought that up, they said, yes, you're right, John Lennon.

No, they, you know, they ran the ship.

They ran the ship.

You just assembled them.

Wu-Tang, I assembled just, you know, Method Man in there and...

Were you just at a party and you said, hey, you guys all standing together, you should rap together?

And they said, we already do?

We're already doing that.

And this is, you know, we're on a stage here.

I don't think you can take credit for that.

It's not a party, it's a concert, it sounds like.

Well, either way, I gave Method Man his name.

So what happened with his headphones meeting?

Well, that's the other thing too.

I'm sitting there with Dr. Dre.

We're talking for a little while, eating our lunch.

And he says, it's one of those awkward things where you're sitting there, both looking at each other, conversation dies down and you're waiting for the next person.

I know the feeling.

What?

Don't you dare.

Continue, please.

You're sitting there and you say, okay, so what do we here for?

And so both of us had, there was no reason for the meeting.

So each of you separately thought the other person was going to come in.

Had a headphone idea.

Oh, okay.

And he says, so what's the headphones you got?

I said, what are you talking about?

And you thought he had the headphones.

Right.

I mean, how hard is it?

You just make some headphones.

Yeah.

Or you go buy good Dr. Dre headphones beats.

And then you put your own name on them.

Right.

Or you don't, you just sell them at the fucking...

Whoa!

Sorry.

I'm sorry.

Can you bleep that?

I will not bleep that.

I'm so sorry.

Well, John, it's great to see you.

Thank you so much.

It wouldn't be a birthday unless the person who sang birthday.

I don't know if you sang that or I guess it was around for it.

Yeah, it was probably Paul.

I can kind of picture it coming out of my mouth.

Can't you?

Thank you, Chris Tucker.

All right.

Well, John, it's great to see you.

Thank you so much for dropping by.

Well, thanks for having me.

You didn't have me.

I came by.

Yeah, you just burst in.

Thanks for allowing me to come in.

Well, you're Scott's friend.

What else could I do?

I'm Scott free.

All right.

Think about using Scott free in the next 10 years.

All right, maybe, maybe.

Go ahead and easy exit through that door.

I will.

All right, but goodbye.

All right.

See you, John.

Oh, it's a heavy door, Scott.

Okay.

Yeah, you got it?

Okay, good.

Okay.

John Lennon.

Boy, a show where both John Lennon and Moll McCartney appear on it and not together.

Wow.

That is incredible.

But that, you know, hey, maybe those two can get in a room at some point together.

So we have a, um, Hey, wait a minute.

Who's this?

You know me.

I famous working professional musicians sort of know you in the biz.

I think we're close.

Yeah.

I mean, you're friends.

We definitely have hung out.

You haven't been on the show.

It's been a little bit.

Yeah.

Well, more than once.

This may be your second appearance.

I mean, what's a lot?

One is more than it's an infinite more than zero.

I guess it's two more than negative one.

It's the biggest gap between numbers you can have.

I guess so.

Nothing to what is your name again?

Randy useless.

That's right.

Session musician, professional musician.

That's right.

You were on the show recently.

Yes.

And um, you know, first of what I assume will be many appearances perhaps.

Perhaps.

First of two, definitely because you're on right now.

Yeah.

This is already going better than a lot of people told me they thought it might, that might happen.

But you were on one invoke song and you were never on another one.

Well, not yet.

I mean, I'm still alive as I, as I think so.

As are most of invoke if I'm.

As I think that's true.

As I hope.

I hope we haven't just awkwardly said something very distasteful.

Yes.

All of invoke is still with us.

Sure.

Of course.

Even the three.

Don Robinson.

Yes.

The rest.

And the others.

Yes.

Um, all four and then three of them.

Right.

One left.

Sure.

Don left.

Yes.

I'm not a fan of the word of proper nouns, but what I am, what I am up on you on is just musical experience.

That's true.

Now, for those of you who don't recall, Randy was on the show recently.

Yeah.

And you, uh, you are the person who you're a session musician, mainly doing spoken word.

So far my, yes, I'm available to do anything.

I'm here to serve the song.

What I have mostly done is one time on the invoke song, Never Gonna Get It, I said, now it's time for a breakdown.

Right.

By accident.

We found out later that you were not a session musician there.

You were not there to be a session musician.

You are, you, you mainly work as, I also partially work.

You say it's a side hustle, but it's 100% of your income.

Uh, well that's true, but, um, you know, spiritually I'm not in it at all.

So it's like the front side, the back side, the side sides, it's your side hustle.

It's a, I would, you know, spiritually speaking, it's one eighth side.

It's just from the Northeast angle coming at my shoulder is the only portion of me that's emotionally invested in my actuary side hustle.

You're an insurance.

I'm an insurance actuary.

We estimate statistics of how long people will live.

I guess I could barely, I could care less.

And you were there in studio with Envogue presenting some life insurance policies for the team.

And during the recording session, they were like, come by.

We don't, you know, they were on a tight schedule.

Sure.

Of course.

They're one of the hottest pop groups ever.

They were touring.

They hadn't released the record that made them all that hot, but, uh, they were already living the lifestyle in anticipation.

They were like, we're going to be big.

Let's start being busy all the time.

Right.

So let's multitask and bring this insurance guy in.

And I, you know, I, and I told them you spread out all the papers.

Yes.

And I was, I had to let them know the information and unbeknownst to me, I was the hot mic in the control booth.

Sure.

Well, they were singing an actual song.

They were doing a great song.

Yeah.

Uh, never going to get it.

Never, never going to get it.

Yeah.

The one you're on.

Yes, I know.

I was on the mic and then I said, now it's time for a breakdown.

Because you were trying to explain this information to them.

And I think on some level I also sensed musically because it's such a natural fit for me as a job.

It just naturally happened to occur.

Some would say it was a dumbest of coincidences.

I would say it was an instinct being realized.

Okay.

Perhaps.

A lot of, I've realized a lot of things in life are open to interpretation.

Okay.

So you said now it's time for a breakdown.

They just left it in.

They left it in.

They also said you're fired.

Get out of here and chase you out of that.

You have a great memory for detail.

I wouldn't have brought that part of it up.

But yes, that's true.

I was, I mean, again, this is a matter of opinion, but I was fired as an insurance broker and fled from the studio.

But lo and behold, by the way, you thought something was going to happen.

You could have just walked out of there.

Well, I get embarrassed easily and I'm not good at emotional confrontation.

So once I realized they were a little upset, I took off.

Right.

High speed through the streets of Oakland.

Yeah.

How fast are you going?

Let's say I'm not great at estimating.

I'm going to say one mile an hour.

Okay.

That's not a high speed for walking.

Okay.

Well, it felt good.

Two.

I mean, two was about, you know, is it a trot?

You want to get up to maybe four as a quick walk?

Oh, I was running.

Let's guess seven and a half miles an hour.

Okay.

That's not bad.

That's a quick run.

What does a bike do?

A bike can get up there in the 20s or 30s?

Yeah.

Somewhere in there.

Not 30s.

20s though, right?

I'm not sure if you're going to be able to go through this right now.

No, let's get more into it.

So, Randy, I'm running top speed.

You're running top speed.

At least one mile an hour.

I don't want to over promise.

Sure.

So between one and eight, perhaps.

Yeah.

One and eight, maybe nine.

I don't know.

I broke a sweat.

We'll call it into single digits.

Okay.

That's fair.

Okay.

And, you know, months later or yeah.

So a few months later that song came out and they left it in.

And there's your, did you receive any money for this?

I do.

I never asked you.

And I don't mind.

I just wanted to serve the work, to serve the song.

Did you sign a release as you were leaving, as you were fleeing, as you said?

I didn't sign anything, but I did shout, I'll do whatever it takes for, to not be in trouble.

So maybe that's a form of release.

Verbal contract, perhaps.

If they were still recording.

Yeah.

Okay.

I wonder why they didn't keep that in.

Yeah.

What a fit.

Hey, if they want to do a remix and rerelease, I'm willing to go back and, you know, we can re lay down some tracks, you know.

Have you, so since then, have you been, since the last time I saw you, you've been doing it, not been in the studio since then.

Have you been in recently?

I have.

Really?

Yes.

And I have you to thank for that.

Okay.

The exposure of being on this show, which I didn't realize people listen to this.

People actually do listen to this.

Yeah.

It's crazy.

A lot of people have approached me and they were moved by my story, interested in my talents.

They were soothed by my vocal cadence.

And I have, I've had books, some work.

Wow.

Tell us about it.

I've been back in the studio.

And now is this in vogue level work or?

Well, no, it's not quite, you know, I'm willing to pay my dues again, you know, I think so.

It's not quite at that level.

Do you have to pay dues as an actuary?

Is that what you mean?

Yeah.

There's a, yeah, there's a huge union for actuaries because we get pushed around.

So you stopped paying those dues for a while and now you're.

I quit paying those dues and all dues and I'm willing to start paying dues again.

Okay, great.

Yeah.

I mean, this is a whole complicated pro union issue, but I'm, I'll pay my dues to the actuary union and to the, to the, to the muse of pop music success.

Sure.

Okay.

I've been back in the studio and it was, um, are you familiar with the artist Eminem?

Do you know him?

I stan him.

Yes.

Do you know him?

I do.

You stan him?

Yes.

Oh, you're referring to one of his songs, right?

Well, yes, but I also have a big, big fan.

Okay.

I mean, I think the guy's great.

I mean, I think this is a talent.

Of course, Marshall Mathers.

Yes.

That's how he got his name.

I don't know if you know that, but the M in Marshall.

Wow.

Uh, uh, if you take that and then you take the M in Mathers.

Which one?

I don't know.

I'm going to take the M in Mathers.

I was once struck in the head by a pendulum.

Oh, was this Big Ben or?

I wish.

A little tinier?

Yeah, smaller.

Like a grandfather clock?

Yeah, it was his grandfather clock.

So you're grandfathered into this?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm grandfathered into a head condition.

Okay.

Literally, a grandfather clock pendulumed me into a slight head condition.

I have some memory issues, a bit of a schizophrenia.

Sure.

Oh, schizophrenia.

Well, that's self-diagnosed.

Oh, okay.

Which I'm like, that's not what I asked you.

So no, we were talking about M in M. M in M, yes.

You have been recording with M in M. I mean, he's a spoken word artist.

I mean, yes.

He's one of the best, I would say.

Right.

Yeah.

And he excels at it.

Yes.

I was cleaning some fixtures.

Okay.

As a, I was doing a little extra, I was doing work at, there's a studio in Detroit called Electric Soup.

You probably don't know it.

Don't know it.

Did you say Electric Lady Land?

Well, that's New York, of course.

Right.

This is Detroit.

This is Electric Soup.

They're more laid back there.

Okay.

Got it.

Anyway, and I volunteered to do a little work just to get my foot in the door.

I'm like, hey, I got to pay my dues.

Sure.

So I was doing some cleaning.

You want to put yourself in that in vogue situation again, where you- Just like, maybe I'll be, let magic happen.

Sure.

Of course.

So you're cleaning fixtures, chandeliers.

I imagine it's the fanciest of studios.

Chandeliers, the best of fixtures.

Chandelabras, any fixtures around.

Light switches, lots of fixtures.

Sure.

That's my specialty.

I was willing to clean anything, but I was like, I'll start with the fixtures.

Like the knobs on the drawers and stuff like that?

Yeah, knobs in the drawers, things that are surrounding nooks and crannies.

Backsplashes.

Sure.

Backsplashes are great to maybe take a throw pillow, pluff it up.

Yeah, fluff it.

Oh, what's that word?

Fluff.

Oh, I say pluff.

Okay.

It's a harder P. People hear you better over the phone.

Do you change all F words to P words so people hear you better?

I do the math on that really fast, but let's say I do.

Really fast, you mean?

Yeah, see, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to make good on that.

But let's say I do.

And so there I am in electric soup and I'm cleaning some fixtures and Eminem walks in.

Wow.

And actually, he's a pretty laid back guy.

He is.

For like, for someone of such success.

And such aggressive music style.

And such aggressive alpha persona and his music, when he's not recording, the guy is chill.

Okay.

He might not have been him.

Oh, really?

He was recording in this studio.

And you, and what did he look like?

He was a woman.

This is not Marshall Mathers.

Well, he was recording.

They told me that he records in that studio.

Okay, yeah, but it does not sound like it was him.

Oh, I mean, I assume these people have sort of, you know, they got to keep their identity on the down low for the fans.

Sure, perhaps he's disguising himself.

Okay.

Who knows?

And just because he's supposed to be here, even though this looks like a woman, I guess this is him is what I'm thinking.

And what was he or she recording?

He or she was recording an audio children's book.

Okay.

Called Be Nice to Everybody No Matter What.

Okay.

Yeah.

That's good advice.

That's a lovely...

For children of all ages.

That's a lovely sentiment.

Sure.

And I, you know, so I just kept on, I don't think that she, he knew I was there and I just sort of piped in now and then with some ad libs trying to spruce up the audio book.

Sure.

And I don't yet know if these made it in.

Okay.

You haven't received a copy of it yet.

No, I'm waiting for it.

It hasn't been released.

Right.

Have you been looking for Eminem releases?

Yeah, Eminem releasing.

You may want to look up to the title.

Be Nice to Everyone No Matter What.

No, I'm an artist search only kind of guy.

Titles is too many.

Artists, that narrows it down.

Sure.

Yeah.

You probably don't know a lot about database indexes.

This is almost as interesting as the land speed of runners.

But if you have to search a database column, the fewer rows you're searching, the faster the search.

Sure.

So what kind of thing is- Fewer artists than song titles is what I'm saying.

What kind of things were you saying?

I was saying, now it's time for a breakdown.

Now it's time for a breakdown.

Just some ad libs and this is your- Whatever came to my mind.

Just like whatever is in the moment, whatever felt right or true.

Sure.

Scott, you're an artist.

You can relate to this.

Hmm.

You don't, art is a lot of time, it's about truth.

Hmm.

You can't come in with an idea, you can't force things.

And sometimes that truth is, I want to say my famous catchphrase.

Yeah.

Like I'm willing, I want to strike gold again.

I'm a desperate man and I'll do anything.

And that's true.

And I was like, this is going to read.

Right.

So I don't know yet if it made it in.

But I was in the studio again with Eminem and I had this show to thank.

Well good luck to Eminem.

Because when I got the janitor job, I name dropped you pretty heavily.

And that worked.

It worked like a charm.

Yeah.

It's incredible.

Randy, useless.

Yeah, so I really appreciate it.

Yeah.

I really support you and your music career.

I would like nothing less than for you to get out of the insurance game and just...

I mean, I'm out as far as I'm concerned.

Have you told your bosses this?

No, no, no.

I'm on break right now.

Sabbatical or literally a coffee break?

Long lunch.

Yeah.

This is, by the way, in another part of the country.

It's in Connecticut.

I work in Hartford, Connecticut.

And this is Los Angeles.

Long, long coffee break.

Yep, well they trust me.

Does anyone notice when you're gone?

Unfortunately no.

Hmm.

But I don't take that personally.

I say that's a sign of respect.

Do you take it professionally?

Because they should notice it that way as well.

I'll consider it.

Hmm.

Well Randy.

Scott.

Incredible stuff.

Oh, thank you.

I really appreciate it.

The sky's the limit.

You're one of our newest favorites.

So the fact that you decided to drop by...

I thought for the 10th anniversary there should be someone who's really made a legacy at this show.

One of the really important characters who's logged, what, 40, 45 minutes of time on the show?

Maybe at a huge outside estimate?

But people like you...

I mean, I'm recent, so they gotta remember.

Right, that's true.

Bringing some schmuck from episode 50, you know what I'm saying?

Like, come on.

Like some of our previous guests.

Yeah, whoops.

Randy, I hope when you come back, I hope that some of your work will be officially released.

Hey, me too.

And I'll have you to thank for it.

Well...

And all the fans of the show.

Thank you so much for putting my name out there.

Okay, well, we're not at the end of the show, so I'll usually thank people then.

And let's just wrap it up.

We have to thank our engineers.

Okay, they're playing you off.

There's one, one, one, one, one, one.

All right, thank you, Randy.

Bye!

Randy's gone.

Oh boy, Randy Useless, the very definition of a recent favorite.

I think he was on merely three or four weeks ago, so...

And great to see him.

What a wonderful addition to the comedy bang bang cast of characters.

When I say cast and characters, that is no indictment of the people who drop by who are very, very real and mean a lot to me.

And I think...

Oh my God.

Hey, Scott.

Is this who I think it is?

Yeah, it's me.

Europearl Captain Mustache.

Oh my God, Captain Mustache.

As Boston comedian Captain Mustache, as I recall, you were on the show very early, I think, episode 32 in our first year.

And then we didn't see you until episode 498, as I recall.

So you're one of our oldest and yet not closest friends to the show.

I was hearing, I was so embarrassed.

What was that?

I said I'm right.

I got...

You are so out of breath.

Yeah.

What happened?

I caught my arm against the wall.

You caught your arm against the wall?

No, I'm describing how I'm standing.

I caught my arm against the wall and I'm breathing heavy.

Oh, that's for sure.

Okay, yeah.

I see everything that you're describing right now.

Yeah, but the listeners can't see this, Scott.

You're right.

So thank you for describing the fact that your arm is against the wall.

That's a vital piece of information.

My other arm's holding onto my hip.

Yeah.

And your legs?

You haven't described what they're doing.

They're both kind of buckling a little.

They're shaking.

They are shaking.

Why did you rush over here?

Well, I was afraid that I was going to get late.

Well, this is a 10 hour show.

I mean, it's...

Oh, yeah, that's right.

It's a 10 hour one.

Yeah, you could have come here hours from now.

Yeah.

Well, I got to say every time I listen, it feels like a 10 hour show.

Hey, Captain Mustache.

I know you're out of breath, but is that really the place for...

Well, I love joking around with you.

That's for sure, Scott.

You do.

You are one of Boston's greatest comedians.

I mean, most legendary comedians.

I can't say it myself.

I'll say it for you.

I mean, so Captain Mustache.

Well, I've influenced a lot of people and I think you can kind of hear my stylings and a lot of the great young kids today, such as Jay Leno.

You know, I think Seinfeld's, Jerry Seinfeld.

So now, Captain Mustache, for those of you who haven't heard the two episodes that apparently bookended approximately eight years or so.

Yeah.

Captain Mustache is an older gentleman who considers Jay Leno and Seinfeld, both in their 70s, as I recall, to be young.

I have a couple of kids.

Well, we started, I started out before them.

Captain Mustache, you're a comedian.

Yes.

And, but you're out there doing the Boston clubs.

Yeah, I'm doing it.

Well, not, not really.

No.

Where, where are you performing?

I've been in a hibernation.

I tend to hibernate for about seven to eight years.

Do you mean metaphorically as, is that why we didn't see you on the show between episode 30?

That was part of it because I was hibernating, as I call it, hibernating, which also means taking really long naps, getting just generally sleepy.

So you're, are you literally hibernating like a bear or where you're asleep for months?

I usually just put on sweatpants, you know, put, you know, go around the apartment, you know, you know, look at the plant, give it some water if it's too dry and, you know, generally putts around.

Just puttering around the house is what you're describing.

Puttering, that's the word I'm looking for.

Thank you, Scott.

Puttering around the house and you know, looking for material.

Oh, have you ever looked at that plant and gotten some material out of it?

Yeah, it was a ficus tree.

And one day this is, this isn't, this isn't finished.

This is something I've been working on for about eight years.

So we'll lower our expectations.

Lower your expectations.

You know the business.

So here's the joke or the area of the joke.

Okay.

I go to move my ficus tree.

See, you're already laughing.

I know.

I think I'm sniffling.

That was a laugh.

That counts.

That counts as a laugh.

Well, yeah, if you really want to count my allergies.

So there I am moving around, doing my thing and I decided I needed to move my ficus tree.

Now we're going back to the beginning of the joke where you decided to move your ficus tree.

Okay, great.

Yeah, I kind of didn't want this voice.

So you consider if you do it in a different voice that it's not repeating.

It's a rewrite.

Got it.

So there I am walking around, moving the ficus tree.

And then the next day the ficus, I move it from one inch to another inch over.

You know, you know, did you ever do that?

What's that now?

It's part of the crap work.

Part of the joke.

Oh, sorry.

Do you ever do that?

Do you need me to say, yeah, we do.

Yeah.

Occasionally we move our plans.

Well, anyway, so it's, this is a good joke now that I'm listening to it out loud because I've never really told it before.

Well, you think that what we've heard out loud is the good part so far?

I mean, I'm intrigued because nobody knows where it's going to go.

And this is the part, if I were to give a comedy class, this is the part where you just sit there for a long time.

The pre-punch line.

Yeah.

You're just living in a world of possibilities at this point.

What's going to happen?

Right.

Nobody wants to know what's going to happen next.

Well, big finish.

Right.

So the next day I look over in the flaky street, all of its leaves fall off on the ground and it doesn't have any leaves no more.

And it pretty much dies.

Did you say ma?

Oh, it doesn't have leaves anymore.

Oh, sorry.

I thought you were calling me ma.

Why would I call you ma?

That's why I was very confused.

All right.

Okay.

It doesn't have leaves.

You're- You're as confused as I was.

This is why you don't let the audience talk to you.

Am I, is this considered heckling?

I mean, I thought we were doing an interview.

Yeah.

Sorry.

I'll back off.

Thank you.

Finish the joke.

Oh, thank you.

Hold on.

My mouth is dry.

If you can keep a joke going, this is what the greats always say.

If you can keep a joke going, the same joke going for like a half hour.

Then you can write less jokes.

You don't have to write as much.

How often do you take sips of water during one joke?

Oh, I'll bring a gallon or two on stage in a little martini glass.

And then I'll bring a martini glass filled with martinis.

And then I'll just take turns.

Take what now?

I'll take turns going back and forth.

Little bit of water.

One for you, one for me.

This is Scorsese.

There's the plant.

It's Scorsese.

He would do one movie for the studio, one for him.

One for them, one for me.

What is the passion of the Christ fall for that?

I think that was for him.

Was he forced to make this one?

I think that his general thing is I'll make a color of money and then I'll make a Kundun.

One for them, one for me.

Color of money is for them?

It was a big hit.

A lot of money.

Tom Cruise in it.

Sure.

That's for them.

Paul Newman.

Don't forget him.

He's still a star.

Well he's passed away at this point.

He has.

I think you were hibernating while he passed away.

Perhaps I was.

So anyway, there I am.

I think the audience is hibernating currently waiting for you to get to the punchline of the joke.

The audience right now is white knuckling their radios.

Their deboxed seats.

Yeah.

Is this come with deboxed seats?

I would be interested if anyone were to listen to this podcast while sitting in deboxed seats whether it would rumble.

Yeah.

You know what's good?

Those seats that square at you with water.

I've heard that.

Yeah.

You ever been to a movie where there's a lot of sneezing in it?

Is this part of the joke?

I don't know.

Is this exploratory?

Maybe I'm just, maybe I'm feeling jazzy today.

Figuring it out when I get there.

That's what What's His Face used to do.

That one guy.

Bob Fosse?

Yeah.

Bob Fosse.

I think I smoked a lot of cigarettes.

Yeah.

Now I've noticed that you haven't been smoking since you walked in here.

No.

That's part of why I was out of breath because I was finishing up.

Because you haven't been smoking.

Because I haven't been smoking in here.

No, because I couldn't find the door.

I was walking around.

I went to the wrong door.

I went in and I saw.

Here's what happened before this.

I sat down in another place.

I started talking to a guy who I thought was you.

And we were getting into it for a while.

And then I said, aren't you going to press record?

And he said, what do you mean, aren't you going to press record?

And I said, what do you mean?

What do I mean?

What do you mean?

And then I figured it out.

I said, your name's not Steve, is it?

And he said, what?

It is Steve.

I go, it is?

I think the guy's name is Scott.

And then that, it just was great.

He really had to be.

Who did this turn out to be?

I don't know.

Here's the problem.

I can't tell the difference between what happened and what didn't.

That's I believe, I mean, you're so much older than Jerry Seinfeld.

You may be experiencing, I hate to say this, but dementia of some sorts.

Oh, well, if this is dementia, it's not bad.

That's true.

I mean, that's a good tagline.

From my point of view.

It's a good tagline of the show.

If this is dementia, it's not that bad.

It's not that bad.

I just don't make a lot of plans, disappoint people.

So there I am.

No leaves.

Dead tree.

One day later.

All I did was move it one inch.

And my question is, do you think that tree's overreacting?

Well Captain Mustache, you're one of our greatest friends.

I will, it's so great to be back.

It's so good to see.

I don't think this episode would have been complete without you dropping by.

I think you're right.

I hope to see you at the end of another 10 years.

I look, that's the soonest I want to see you.

Captain Mustache is 10 years from today.

Well in 10 years, let's make a deal.

Okay.

I'm going to have a rewrite of that Ficus tree joke.

I'm looking forward to that.

Okay.

It's great to be here.

Captain Mustache, thank you for dropping by.

Thank you so much.

Goodbye everyone.

I love you all.

Bye.

We love you too, Captain Mustache.

I think, I don't know.

I barely know the guy.

But one of our earliest guests and incredible to see him.

And people have been dropping by through this door.

So wait a minute.

Is that the phone here in the studio?

Who left the phone on in the studio?

Okay.

Maybe we're getting a call for zoom.

Let's pick it up here.

And hello.

Oh my God.

Is this who I think it is?

The only person who calls me Choctaw?

I think it's Marissa Wampler, my old, my old intern.

Get your dong out.

It's time to celebrate your 10th anniversary.

What are you, 85 years old?

What are you?

You must be around 85 as well.

You've been on the entire 10 years as a teenage girl.

Who knows?

Where are you?

Why are you calling me?

Why aren't you here?

Listen, listen.

I had a lot going on.

I am right now in the midst of renovating the condo.

And it's a real money pit situation.

So I can't leave the house because there are no doors or windows.

Oh, it sounds like a haunted mansion.

Yes, that's right.

So it's in order to protect the few things I still own.

There's always my way out.

What?

Nothing.

I'm sorry to interrupt you.

Look.

Hey, where's a list lear?

Put her on.

You haven't heard?

What do you mean?

Haven't heard what?

You were on a break.

You were on a break like Ross and Rachel?

What do you mean?

This isn't- List lear and I are on a break.

No, no, no.

I want List lear on the show.

No, she does.

Hey, you're not enough?

Let me remind you.

It started with me.

I know.

I had you on first and then List lear came on after that.

But still, I mean, that was that's first year stuff.

People don't remember that.

People just remember you as Wampler and List lear, the Womp It Up co-host.

Look, I have her number.

I'm going to patch her in.

Yeah.

No, what do you mean you have your number?

I have her number.

Yeah.

Engineer Sam, let's patch her in.

There's the number.

All right, here we go.

We're dialing.

She's been on the grid.

I'm not ready to talk to her.

Hello?

Hi, List lear.

It's me, Scott.

List lear.

How do you get this number?

I look, I have to confess, the last time you were in here, I cloned your phone and I do it with all of my guests.

I'm sorry.

I like to see if they have any funny pictures or anything like that. So I got your number from that. But hey, Wampler's on the party line here. Wampler, say hi to Lissler.

Oh, hey, Lissler. How's it going?

It's actually going very well, thank you. How are you?

Where are you?

I can't tell you that.

I haven't gotten any calls. I haven't gotten any texts. You haven't dropped any chicken bones off at my doorstep. What the fuck, man?

Well, that's because I'm in an undisclosed location, okay?

And I don't want to give you any clues. You have to survive on your own for a little while. See what that feels like.

Yeah, we'll see what it feels like to be in the undisclosed location of my butthole.

Oh, shit.

That doesn't make any sense.

You know what I'm saying?

Because you know what I needed?

What?

A whole lot of self-care.

Who's gonna take a lot of love? Yeah, yeah.

What are you, like, in a coming to America type of situation where a bunch of people are sudsing you up?

I don't know if that's really an accurate metaphor. I think you should probably stay away from that.

That's where it stuck with you from that film? Is when he got washed?

Isn't it fun to laugh at me again? Well, guess what? I'm not your little bitch boy, okay? I wouldn't have called you if Choctaw hadn't...

What did you call yourself? A bitch boy? I like that.

Look, I really wanted to broker a piece between you. Yeah, I heard your last episode of the Womp It Up podcast where you guys had a fight, but I thought that I could be like, you know, Frank Sinatra on the Jerry Lewis telethon bringing Dean Martin out, you know, and making you guys hug, you know? I mean, that's what a 10th anniversary is for.

Oh, really? Or is this just for you to get ratings, alright, to stay relevant? Don't use us like Andy Cohen.

I like Ryan's roses. I got us... And I don't care for that.

Where you cold call a boyfriend and ask who he'd like to send roses to and it's usually not his wife.

If you think me airing a very distant sounding telephone call is to get ratings, I think you have another thing coming. I just, I wanted you both on the show. You were such a big part of it from the beginning.

You're welcome to come into your own show and I get it. You don't have a lot of time to come back, but I wanted to talk to you both.

Well, I can't come back because I'm physically not able to come back. I don't know what her excuse is.

Why? Why are you physically unable? Did you lost the use of your legs? What's going on? Are you too far away?

I'm too far... I'm several weeks journey from the studio.

Okay?

I'm not going anywhere. By sea? By plane?

A lot of self care going on over here. You know, Ockerman, when people show you who they are, you need to listen.

Listen the first time.

Don't be a Yalla Van Zant to me, bitch. That's Maya Angelou.

See, this is why we need to be on a break, Choctaw. Hey, hey, can I come work for you?

Please, you're supposed to be working for me. You're my original intern that never showed up. We've had another one since then.

Are you still dating her? Tony Baloney?

No, it's of course Gino. Gino Lombardo.

Gino, fuck that guy. You know what? You know what? Where my life took a wrong turn, Choctaw, is when I stopped coming into the studio and working for you.

And I started working for Lissler. You know, at the start of the program.

You stopped working for me the second week. You came the first week, then you were gone for several weeks. You've never been the most reliable employee.

Listen, this is a door scenario, okay? And I'm not going to be Gwyneth Pelletier for haircut. I'm going to reverse this situation. I'm going to start from the beginning. I'm going to start coming in. I'm going to be doing my hours.

I'm going to clean the can every so often. And then we'll build this from the ground up. I don't need you, Lissler.

You hear me? I don't need you.

I need you so much.

Oh, God.

Oh, boy.

This is really pitiful. Is this what you wanted?

This is pathetic. I don't know that I wanted to hear Wampler crawl like a worm.

Well, I'm so glad you could humiliate me. On Choctaw's 10th anniversary, this isn't about you, Lissler. This is about him. And him trying to clean things.

To stay relevant. That's what it's about. Listen, Choctaw, I'm going to take you to get some highlights. I know you're feeling your age. It's time to just get a new look. And I'm willing to make you over, all right? You don't have to ask.

I'll be there. I'll pick you up.

I don't know, Wampler. I don't know that you're a trusted resource for personal hygiene, necessarily.

Listen, Choctaw, I'm going to pick you up. We're going to get some frosty tips.

I have plenty of frost on my tip. I really don't need you.

It's not going to happen.

That's disgusting.

You guys are disgusting. Look, guys, I appreciate, first of all, Wampler, I appreciate you calling in. And Lissler, I appreciate you answering the phone. But we have to go. Anytime you call, I didn't know you had this number, but anytime you call, I will answer because I do owe you my life. And that's a couple different ways.

Okay, I had no idea that you owed me your life. That's new to the canon. But guys, thank you so much for being part of the 10th anniversary. You've been there since the beginning.

It means so much to me.

Thanks a lot for bringing this emotional ruin to my doorstep. I really appreciate it. And listen, you get that guest drink cleaned out because I'm coming. And if you feel a warm hand on your soft underbelly, that'll be me crawling into bed next to you.

Oh, God, please don't. Let my soft underbelly alone, please.

All right, guys, thank you so much.

Thank you. All right, bye Choctaw, congrats.

Why don't we steal away, steal away? Why don't we steal away?

All right, bye, Lissler.

Oh, wow. So special to hear from those guys. I mean, they some of our earliest guests and they've created their own show from it that that's been going on. Of course, I haven't approved it, but they did it on their own and they didn't ask me whether they could or not. But, you know, hey, God bless them. I hope those two patch it up, though, and I'm sure they will in a few months time.

Well, guys, that is just about going to do it for us. We are getting close to the 10 hour mark here. And there really is only one final feature that we have left on the show. It's something we do every single week. And it's one of the fans. They love this. They skip to it. They skip to it.

I'm sure that it's daunting to skip through an entire 10 hour podcast, but I know some of you did. It's time for our best final feature here on the show. It's time for a little something called Plugs.

I don't mean to be rude or sound like a humbug, but I waited the whole episode to hear some plugs. I don't use curse words or take a list of drugs. My only true vice in life is the plugs.

That's a good song. That is a good song. That song's okay.

That's a great song. I didn't like that song. Is that even a song? That's a good song. Not very good song. The only good songs are hidden.

What is it? Oh, hi. How you doing, Scott? Oh, I got his Jesse Ventura straight from the plug bag.

I've got it held open with my strong arms. You've been in there. Don't let it collapse upon yourself.

Well, it is kind of like a sphincter muscle. Your strong arms are for the plug bag. Well, I'm holding it open like a real like a like Big John. If you remember the song from the sixties.

Jesse, you've been trapped inside the plug bag every once in a while. We'll open up the plug bag and we'll hear your voice coming out of it. It's not so bad. You see trapped.

Some of us learn to come to terms with the situation we've been given.

So you've been enjoying it inside the plug bag? I alluded to that previously. Yes. And here I am. Look, I want you to know it's not so bad. What is it like? Is it like a dark nothingness?

You make it think like it's an exotic other and it is. It's a bit like when wacko, uh, porky goes to wacko land.

I don't know what either of those things are. Porky. Well, it's a classic Warner brothers. It's I thought you were saying porky like Porgy and Bess.

Well, there is a look, the little known sequel to Porgy and Bess. Porgy goes to wacko land. I have season tickets to the St. Paul light opera.

I'm sure you do. I'm afraid you've been missing it for the past few years because you've been trapped in the plug bag.

Again, you say trapped. Let me introduce you to an idea of kayfabe. Kayfabe? Kayfabe. Yeah. Okay. What is it? It's a wrestling terminology.

I've heard of this. We uphold the reality. Now I'm out of the ring now. I can tell you the truth. But when I'm in the plug bag, I'm acting like it's people look down on wrestlers.

Like we're just thugs or people that would have been hunched over a bar die in at the age of 45. No, I circus people.

And let me tell you, we're trained actors.

Right? Yes. I mean, primarily you're acting when you're wrestling. There's not a lot of physical, uh, uh, punching or, uh, there's, there's a lot, it's not punch. There's a lot of light touching.

You call it light touching. Let me tell you it's, it's full contact acting. What's so hard for you to wrap your mind around? I guess you and a porn star are very similar in the sense of it's full contact acting.

Well, you could say that. You could say that. And I do wear condoms when I'm in the ring. I wear condoms in the ring.

In fact, I have a, I have a full girdle condom that goes around the, the edge of a little speedo speedo thing.

So a little speedo singlet is that to protect yourself or to make sure there's no drippage coming out or what? You never know. You got to practice safe grappling because you might just wind up inside the other wrestler at some point.

It has, it has happened. You know, somebody, somebody grabs and you get a little doink like the little girl, like the little girl on the suntan lotion.

You get a little, you get a little of a, your, Oh, the cheeks fell out. Wasn't that Jodie Foster or someone like that? It might've been, or is that the Morton salt girl? I'm not really sure which one it is.

Look, Scott, I have this, I have this plug bag sphincter held open. I'm getting a little tired here. Why don't you step into the plug bag? Oh no, I don't want to go into the plug bag. Why don't you come out of the plug bag? Because I wanted to show you around.

Oh, look, I'm willing to go inside the plug bag. Can we prop it open and you'll just sit on the lip of it like on my front porch?

I invited you in. It's a little rude. I'm being Minnesota nice for you. Okay, sure. I'll just pop my head in just a little bit. If I pop your head in. Okay. I'll be dropping on you.

I'm just kidding. Just kidding. Now. Oh, see, it's real. It's real. Oh my God. Just sit down here. How long was I in there? You were in the plug bag for in humid. Look at in your world just for half a second.

But in the plug bag, you experienced 24,000 years of promotional existence has cool up left me by now. Well, not in this world, but in that world, not only did cool up leave, but you went through several cycles of evolution.

Oh, my God. You now you've seen what I've seen here. Sit down. Let me get a job. Let me get a big two by four and prop this thing open. Okay. Oh, that should hold. And thank God people were plugging two by fours. Yeah.

I saw Jim Duggan was here earlier. Oh my gosh. Okay. I think I'm feeling a little bit better. Here. Can I get you an ice tea? Yeah. Is it some lemonade or something like that? Maybe a plug from the end of an old car set or something? Okay.

Here, let me get you a glass of here. Louie Anderson's going to be at the Harris casino with lots of fresh. We subsist on ancient plugs inside the plug bag. We live off the land like William Tecumseh Sherman. Oh, Jesse.

I spend time at my little ranch down in the plug bag, swimming and surfing. Look, I do. I still sneak out at night. Sneak out of the plug bag. Oh, yup. Full nighttime Navy seal underwater demolition team.

Oh, of course. Yeah. You're the most adept at that. Yep.

Were you involved in dark green camouflage? And then I swim over to the studio to do my RT show. What were you involved in the Osama bin Laden raid? Nope. That was a seal team sex.

Right. Which seal team are you in?

Well, that was seal team six. I'm in seal team 4.2. Oh, that's too bad. So you just missed it. Well, I know I didn't miss it. That was, there's lots of iterations. That was a seal team that was way back in the seventies. Right? Yeah.

That was analog.

Yeah. What was that? One of the seal teams you wished you had been a part of? I was involved. Well, let me tell you, I was involved in, um, I was involved in the operation to get the hostages out of Iran. You were, Oh my gosh. Back in the 1980 or 81. Let's say that that tracks. I was involved.

Sorry. 79. Something. Yeah. Jimmy guard. I was, I was there arms for hostages. I was hovering in a helicopter over Tehran hurling arms down on him saying, give us the hostages. This is like something out of an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.

It's something out of a Jesse Ventura movie. Get it right.

Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Which ones were you in command? I don't have a problem with, with, I don't have a problem. I'm not jealous of Arnold Schwarzenegger at all.

He was just on a rocket ship to fame after those movies.

Well, we're blood brothers from predator. Right. What'd you think of it? Did you see the recent predator movie? Well, they've diverged from the cannon. Right. And that's something I had to let go of in the plug back.

The idea of a lot of people were plugging predator about September of last year or so Olivia Munn was, had some issues with the press schedule. You almost know it better than I do. I was a little bit miffed that they didn't bring me along as an elder statesman for the junket.

Right. But just to hover behind everyone and camouflage. I think you could just camouflage to foliage. You could camouflage to anything. Scott. I know how to put half a movie poster down the side of my face and look like I'm in the back of an e-package.

Look, Jesse, if you want to go back in the plug bag, I'm about to start plugs, but you can go back in. You can escape. You can do whatever you like. Well, what would escape be? I know how to get out. I could get out through this way. There's other universes. I could show you Andromeda if you want.

You know, Graham Hancock. No, I don't. Graham Hancock asked cool up. Cool up introduced me to Graham. Graham Hancock is the two Minnesotans. If you listen to Joe Rogan, that's basically all he talks about.

Graham Hancock. He talks about the possibility of advanced civilizations. Look, I've seen it in the plug bag wormholes that would blow your mind. Wow. You know Stargate?

The movie starring Jay Davidson and his penis. Or the TV show starring a bunch of lesser people. Right. It's nice.

Nothing. It's nothing like that. Why didn't Jay Davidson show his penis in Stargate? He did it so well in the crying game.

Well, when you're in an interdimensional gate, there's a pixelation. It's like similar to shrinkage. But sometimes parts of you that are clothed get confused by the little micro beings that are trying to figure out how to reconfigure you. It's a lag. It's a lag time before they fit all the pieces together.

So it's almost like a little game of Tetris where your penis re-materializes in one universe or the other.

You know, sex is the original Tetris when you think about it. You know? I think so. You gotta figure out which blocks.

Twist around into which blocks.

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

Look, Jesse, do you want to go back in? Do you want to stay?

I have to do the plugs. I'm fine. I'm fine like this. You're fine like this. Like two friends sitting on a front porch.

Well, I have to get to the plugs though. Do you? Look, let me hold. Let me just. I'm not going to open it all the way.

Let me just pick this up a little for you.

Okay. I don't want to go back in there. Just look at it. I can't. It felt like staring into the face of God. Look at all those beautiful plugs. I don't think human eyes were meant to see that. They weren't meant to see it, but there they are looking at it.

My God. It's all made of plugs. That's an Arthur C. Clarke level of wisdom that I've got from the end of 2001, Space Odyssey.

Oh my gosh. Oh, too many plugs. Radio shows, podcasts, TV shows that people thought they were going to be on.

Everyone has a podcast now. There's thousands of podcasts spawning other podcasts.

When we first started the show, we were the only podcast.

You were the only podcast, but look at it. And then cereal came around and ruined it.

Look at your children in these other universes that you've created. You're not only a God, you're a galaxy. You're a God. You're a creature that spawns gods.

Well, that's a wonderful way to look at it, Jesse. Thank you so much. There's many planets being birthed and taken back from this. They're being birthed from stars, being consumed by stars.

They come from you. They come from me. We are, we are not only the future, we are this one present eternal moment.

Wow. I never thought of it that way. So speaking of podcasts, there's a new one that I'm pretty interested in.

It's funny that you should mention it.

Great. Let's hear about it. Well, it's called The Under Culture. It's going to be on Forever Dog.

Forever Dog?

Yep. That's one of the little spinoff galaxies out there.

And what is this podcast?

Well, all I know is that I'm going to be on it.

Wow. Okay.

It's somebody who's in some ways a nemesis of mine. His name is James Adamane. He's doing a podcast. It's called Under Culture. It's going to be on Forever Dog.

He asked me to be a part of it. We've never met in person.

I've, look, I've showed up in camouflage at some of his standup shows. It's pretty good.

Pretty good until about two thirds of the way in and then I got to find a bathroom or he gets too dirty, one or the other.

Okay, well, so...

Either I get too dirty down there or he gets too dirty up there. You know what I mean?

So that is...

I don't mind the gay stuff. I want to be clear about that.

I don't mind the gay stuff.

You don't mind it.

But when it's graphic, when it's graphic, it's talking about topping and bottoming.

Right.

Look, I know it's...

James is not afraid of that kind of material.

He's not afraid of that kind of thing. And I, look, I would congratulate him, but I'm never there at the end of the show.

Well, that counts as your plug. Is that okay?

Well, look, I don't plug for myself anymore. I've got, I've got twelve thousand more if you want to hear them right now.

I don't know that we have time.

A lot of them have to do with James Adomian.

Okay.

He's on Cartoon President on Showtime.

Okay, great.

Fantastic. You're doing a lot of voices.

He's on, he's on the upcoming season of Talking Tom on YouTube for children.

Okay.

Look, he's going to be at San Diego Comic Con.

Doing what?

Trump versus Bernie. Coming back.

Is there a tour coming?

Who knows? But I know he'll be there.

He's, look, he's on, he's on Human Discoveries debuting on YouTube.

Okay.

I mean Facebook. Sorry, I got that one wrong.

Look, we don't have a lot of time for these plugs.

I don't believe a Bojack Horseman.

Okay, sure.

Look, he's on an episode of Looney Tunes someday. Coming out someday. I don't know how soon.

Okay, look, Jesse, too many plugs.

Check my MDB.

Too many plugs.

Well, I want to plug, you know, keep listening to Comedy Bang Bang.

Did you hear that?

That's all your children.

That's all the stars, all the life forms being consumed and reconstituted and the greater and lesser life forms.

It's a sound that's horrific to humans.

It's not only whole planets, it's giant Kardashev level civilizations being ripped apart by giant Orson Welles Unicron robots and being reconstituted as little podcasts.

But they're all grateful to you, Scott.

Oh my gosh, wow.

How long have you been doing this damn thing?

Ten years.

Ten years on your planet.

On my planet, yes.

He says he's been doing it ten years.

They say it's an unfathomable card deck where each 52 cards is a thousand billion years of different infinite possibilities.

Well, keep listening.

Thanks for dealing the deck, dealer.

And next week we have our 600th episode.

So that's exciting.

Well, that's a little too much.

What do they have to say about that?

They don't like it.

They're not into it.

It's mixed results.

Some of them say you should take a break.

Some of them say, look, they're super fans.

Don't keep listening.

Anything you do spawns something.

Everything you do in this life echoes in eternity.

Look, I remember it fondly.

I remember being on the podcast fondly, but there's a lot to keep you occupied inside the plug bag.

Like what?

Old friends.

Like who?

Old friends in the plug bag?

Well, look, there's the Enigma Force Five.

Half of them are in here.

Half of the Enigma Force Five is in here?

Look, that's a lot of people.

Yeah, who else is...

I'm trying to remember...

Hi, everybody, it's me!

Oh my God, it's Eulhauser!

It's Eulhauser riding on the rings of a Saturn-like planet.

Oh my God, Eulhauser!

Eulhauser, how have you been?

Look at this!

This is an amazing part of California's planetary disk.

Eulhauser, how have you been?

I've been amazing!

Look at this!

I can only imagine.

Each ring is made of ice dust.

How do they make all this ice?

Eulhauser, we miss you.

It's cold out here.

Well, there he goes.

All right, bye Eulhauser!

Wow!

This is truly an amazing part!

Ah! Ah!

Oh no, what happened?

Oh, there he goes.

He got eaten by a plug whale.

Oh no.

There are predators in the plug bag.

Speaking of predators...

Good segue.

Jesse, I have to close up the plug bag.

It sounds like wrap-up tones.

Anytime my voice drops to this level, it's wrap-up tones.

Very familiar with it.

Look, if you think I just drop into this podcast, in this universe, I've got a wormhole out the other end of this bag.

I'm popping into Mark Barrett.

Okay, well have fun.

I never do.

That's right here.

Okay, we do have to close up the plug bag.

Are you going to go back in?

You can close it at any time.

You know I'll be here.

And you know what?

If you want to have fun, close it up.

But I'll wait right here on the other side of the membrane.

And I'll mash my hand into it so you can see the imprint.

And like Spock.

Sure, like Spock or like Billy at the jail.

Like anything, yep.

Any iteration of the trope where someone on one side of a wall does the hand up to the other side of the wall.

I've got you.

But it's going to happen through another dimension.

Another dimension?

Another dimension.

Have you ever had, well the plug bag is a parallel dimension.

Sure.

Have you ever had one of those little boxes that has nails in it and you put your hand on it and then turn it over and it's got the imprint of your hand?

Oh sure, yeah.

And it's artwork until a different fifth grader comes along and swipes it?

Sure.

It'll look a little bit like that.

Okay.

Well, I guess are you ready, Jesse?

I'm ready whenever you are.

Here we go.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

Don't let any air in.

Close it up your heart while you open up the bag.

Open up the bag.

Close your heart.

Open up the bag.

Open up your heart.

Open up the bag.

Close, open, open, open, open, open, open, open.

The bag.

Hi, Jesse.

I sort of like that new closing of the plug bags theme.

I don't know what we do with the old one.

That one hasn't expired yet.

Now we have two that we use?

Do we alternate them?

Do we put them back to back?

I'm not quite sure what to do with this.

Well, we'll find out next week.

I mean, we have a permanent catchphrase at this point, so maybe it's okay that our closing up the plug bag theme is impermanent.

Who knows?

I'm not sure what we'll do until next week, but we'll see you next week for the...

This is very special.

Not only are we doing the 10th anniversary episode this week, the special world-breaking 10-hour podcast, but it's episode 599 this week, so we are going to close up this hundo next week with episode 600.

So that's going to be a very special episode, so I hope you'll return for that.

And by the way, I do want to plug the...

And speaking of plugs, the person or band that wrote the plugs theme, the opening up the plug bag theme, that was I Love Plugs Parentheses No Humbugs, end parentheses, by Big Cat Music Squad.

Thanks to Big Cat Music Squad for their plug theme submission.

If you have a plug theme, head on over to the Earwolf message boards, put it in the appropriate thread, and you can be famous for a week, and I tell you, Big Cat Music Squad, you're famous for one of the most incredible weeks, the 10-hour podcast world-breaking week.

Yeah, I share this world record with you, Big Cat Music Squad, although I don't mean physically, or really, I don't even really mean it.

And we're coming to the end of the show here, and I have to say thanks to a few people.

First of all, I want to thank all of our guests today who came by.

The response is just overwhelming.

I can't believe so many people came by to say hello and to be part of this.

It really means a lot to me.

And thanks to all of our guests over the previous 10 years.

It's such a, especially 10 years ago, it's such an odd request to receive, hey, do you want to be on a podcast?

I mean, I shudder to hear those words now, let alone 10 years ago.

It was not a very common thing to request of people.

And so I thank anyone who came by, all of the studios we've had over the past 10 years, the radio station and the place right next to the dispensary where you could hear people rooting through the garbage cans right outside, to this beautiful studio we're in now.

It means a lot to me that all of these comedy luminaries came by and agreed to be on the show.

So thank you to them.

I want to thank all of our engineers over the years who have recorded this show and made it happen from Joe Escalante, Engineer Joe, who gave me my first big break to start this show, to Engineer Doug, to Cody, everyone who's worked here.

To those who worked tirelessly on this episode, you have, of course, Engineer Ryan and the newer engineers, Jordan and Devin.

And Sam has worked on this.

And of course, Engineer Brett, who runs the engineers here, and he really wanted to be a part of this, so thanks to him for recording.

Devin did the lion's share of the work, as far as I'm concerned.

As far as I'm concerned, merely that's just because you're to my left right now and I want to make you feel good.

I'm a people pleaser, as you can tell from 10 years of this show.

I want to thank Chef Kevin, who has been organizing the show and coordinating and taking the pictures as best he can and really in conversations with all of the hosting sites to try to see if we could achieve this record-breaking 10-hour episode.

Thanks to Chef Kevin for all of that.

I want to thank everyone at Earwolf, everyone here at Earwolf.

So many great employees who pass through the halls every single day and a lot of them, when I suggested, hey, can we do this 10-hour episode, a lot of times in show business you suggest something like this and people say, like, eh, I don't think so.

To a person, everyone at Earwolf was excited about the idea and really mobilized trying to make it happen, so I want to thank them.

I want to thank Jeff Ulrich, who started Earwolf with me nine years ago and he saw something in the show 10 years ago and became a listener and decided to try to come to me with the crazy idea of what if we launched a podcast network, and here we are, so thanks to him.

And most of all, I want to thank the listeners, the listeners who make it happen every single week.

You know, when I first started the show, it was a radio show that I think a few random hundred people listened to at a time, and we decided to podcast it and quickly saw that a few random thousand people were listening to it instead of a few hundred.

And it grew every week just by word of mouth and from listeners telling other people about it, and really word of mouth is the best way for people to get into podcasts when all of your friends are talking about something really funny and playing it for you in the car and insisting you listen to it and insisting you listen to episodes.

That really has made the show what it is today, and so I want to thank everyone who did that and everyone who's, like I said at the top, listened for the entire time, listened for a short time, have dipped in and out, have, you know, some people come up to me and say, like, you've done almost 600 episodes.

I've listened to about 300.

Hey, that's a great ratio.

I mean, we've done thousands and thousands of hours of podcasting at this point.

So thanks to all of the listeners who made this show what it is and told all of their friends and the critics who have talked about it and written articles about it.

It really means a lot to me.

And that is going to do it for us.

This has been a very, very special episode, but we're not done.

I know a lot of you think that we should be done after achieving something like this, but we are going to be back next week with the 600th episode of this show.

We have something special planned for that, I think.

So we'll see you for, if not another 10, at least another couple of years.

I've been Scott Aukerman.

Thanks so much for listening.

This has been Comedy Bang Bang.

We'll see you next week.

Thanks. Bye.

Yeah.

Heroes.
