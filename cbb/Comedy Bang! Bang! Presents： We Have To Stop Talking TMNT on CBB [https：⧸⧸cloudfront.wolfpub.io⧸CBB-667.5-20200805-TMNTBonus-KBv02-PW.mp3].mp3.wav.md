♪♪♪ Hey everyone, Scott Ocherman here and welcome to a very special episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

Let me give you a little bit of background about what you're about to hear.

So, as many of you know, if you've been listening to the show over the past few months, we have become here at Comedy Bang Bang not only America's podcast and the world's podcast, but we've become the preeminent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles podcast here at Comedy Bang Bang.

Now, how did this happen? It all started a few months back when Sprague the Whisperer, one of our recurring guests that we've had on many, many times. If you don't know who Sprague is, he is, I think he's a manager and a producer. He's been on the show very often and a few months back, I let it be known that I did not know anything about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Sprague is sort of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles super fan.

And so we got to talking about it and we've been talking about it now for several months here on Comedy Bang Bang.

So Sprague and I decided to start a podcast about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

So, you're about to hear the first episode of this. We're calling it, we've got to stop talking about TMNT on CBB. And this is the first episode you're about to hear it as one of our bonus Comedy Bang Bang episodes. Now, we, this episode is just Sprague and I talking about the first movie.

We have recorded several other episodes with a lot of great guest stars. We have Jason Manzukas and Tatiana Maslani and Christian Bruin. If he no other way, so many great guests that we talked to the Turtles with them about. But if you want to hear the rest of the episodes, you'll have to go over to Sean Distin's Patreon. Now, Sean Distin is a client of Sprague. He's a comedian, very funny comedian. He has a Patreon where he puts out podcasts every month. We are putting this out bi-weekly for the next few weeks as long as we can do it. And if you like episode one, episode two is actually available right now with Lauren Lapkis talking about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, the Secret of the Oos. Here's what you do in order to get it. You go to patreon.com slash Sean Distin and Sean has spelled S-H-A-U-N and Distin is D-I-S-T-O-N. It's only $5 a month and you get so many great podcasts and we'll be doing this for the next few months. So until then, I don't know why I said until then, but right now, enjoy the very first episode of We've Got to Stop Talking about TMNT on CBB. All right, here we go. Microphones on. All right, here we go. The house that Freddy built. That's the nickname for the one-time indie film studio that went from distributing propaganda films like Reefer Madness to producing horror classics like Nightmare on Elm Street. Freddy Krueger, the wise-cracking Nightmare invading killer, ruled the 80s and launched the careers of Wes Craven and Johnny Depp. But more importantly, it allowed New Line Cinema to look for new projects. New Line had their first commercial success on their hands, but it wasn't until 1990 that they would agree to distribute a low-budget comic book adaptation already in production in North Carolina. It wasn't until opening weekend that they knew they had a hit on their hands. Turtlemania has taken over the world. It launched a billion-dollar industry out of a kitchen-drawn passion project of comic book nerds Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. The Ninja Turtles IP transformed New Line Cinema, forever making them the movie producing powerhouse we know today. So while Freddy built the house of New Line, it's safe to say movies like Lord of the Rings, It, Austin Powers, Rush Hour and Elf all run on Turtle Power.

This week on Do-Boys, we're talking Ninja Turtles 1.

From one to out of the shadows, we're talking Turtles that is, this is We Have To Stop Talking TMNT on CBB, the comprehensive and encyclopedic compendium of all-thing Turtles. This is good Ninja Turtles content. With me, as always, is my co-host.

As always.

Co-host, Okavin. Yes, that's right, it's good.

I feel like no one- It's the first episode.

Well, I feel like no one sees or hears from me without you, you know?

Oh, that's very kind of you to say. You've been on my podcast, comedy bang bang, several times, although you have your own podcast from what I hear.

I'm fucking around on sort of the Patreon right now, but I don't know how to host a pod, you know.

Did you get a triple double?

Fuck, I fucked around and go to triple double ice cube style.

And, you know, I don't know how to host a pod, Scott, you know?

I feel like I sort of fucked up the intro, but- Yeah, I do have to say that at a certain point you said today on Do-Boys.

Yes, I did say Do-Boys.

So, you did tell me to sort of listen to a Do-Boys and take notes, so I did that.

Well, I told you, I said, you know, be inspired by what Do-Boys did, put your own fresh spin on it. I didn't say just copy what Do-Boys did, including the name of their show.

You told me to introduce myself as Nick Wiger, and I sort of was like, I'm not gonna think that I said anything like that.

I think he did, because you were like, this guy's gonna shit together in a way that sort of- Well, he did do the- he is the number one guest on comedy bang bang.

He's like, let's just be number one guest on bang bang, probably be on like, what, five times?

Seven maybe, and all on Halloween.

All sort of the same bit, you know, for some of these other guys out there, really working on their canon every day.

Really? Yeah, really.

Every day working on the canon.

They sort of get up, they do about 20 minutes of canon sort of research, and it's like, this guy comes in no canon at all, and he's the number one comedy- Look, there's the slightest bit of canon.

Well, yes.

Well, I guess we're talking about Vulture or something, so, and we don't even talk about that.

No, let's not talk about Vulture, let's talk about Turtles.

Today, Scott, we're finally talking Turtles, and- Let me just- Finally, finally, Scott, because this is an emergency podcast in two fronts, Scott.

Front number one.

Me and Scott, for people who haven't heard, I appeared on the podcast a couple months ago, and I told Scott that I had the IP for the Ninja Turtles franchise.

And of course, immediately I had Scott Ockam and one of the best writers I've ever known, to be the writer- Thank you so much, although I don't know that you've ever read anything I've ever written, but thank you so much.

I appreciate that.

I'll take a compliment wherever I can get it.

Do you write the sort of descriptions for the Comedy Bang Bangs?

I don't know. That's July DS.

Absolutely.

You weren't- You didn't hire me just based on those, because I really should- Hold on, hold on.

... indicate my position and give it to July.

I got a hundred-paid, stapled script, and I opened it, and it said, episode one, Comedy Bang Bang, it was just a description.

And then it went all the way to episode 600, Scott, and I was riveted by this thing.

Yeah, so a 600-page script.

Yeah, it was- You were riveted.

Yeah. I know that's July.

You really- I mean, I feel like if you were looking for the person who did those, maybe we should just stop this podcast right now.

Okay, so July- I'm gonna write this down, because you might need him to do punch-up or something, but- Don't just write down July, because that's the month we're in, and I'm really worried you're gonna get confused.

Here's what I'm gonna write down.

July, punch-up.

Okay, no, this is very confusing.

And I'll say maybe the 15th.

You know. Okay, no, this is- No, you're gonna need to be a little more specific than that.

But in any case, you were on my show.

We brought up the Ninja Turtles, because, by the way, thank you so much for having me at Whisper Studios here.

Dude, first of all, Scott, thanks for coming down.

I know it's weird with the quarantine stuff, but I'm glad you came in.

We broke core a long time ago, so we've been- Yeah, you've been having people in and out of this place since what, since like March?

I'd say since like, you know, March 15.

Maybe we never- That's when I started my quarantine.

You know what? Maybe we'd have a quarantine.

Now that I think about it- Yeah, I don't know what you did.

Because of what we're coming in every day.

This place, it's like a- I'm surprised by it.

It's sort of like a lair.

So what a lot of people come in here and they're like, is this a man cave?

Just because of this sort of cave- I think it's like man cave minus man.

It's like- It's like cave.

You know, it's like bear cave.

But we do have a flat- Bear, it's just a cave.

We do have a flat screen in the waiting room, though.

And we have whisper studio lighters in a big bowl that you can take up.

Yeah, the one amenity here at whisper studios.

Yeah, we don't give bottles of water for meetings.

We just hand out lighters.

I am so parched right now, by the way.

I know.

I mean, it doesn't have to be in a bottle.

Is there some sort of babbling stream?

No, we have hot tea in the kitchen.

And that's really all we have.

How hot are we talking?

Scolding hot.

I don't know how to- You know those cups that they had in curvy enthusiasm that heated up the coffee?

Sure, yeah.

Of course it- Classic cur.

Classic. It was the newest season, but we have those.

So we don't drink anything cold here.

It's cave rules, you know.

It's your cave rules.

It's not cold ever.

It's complicated.

You know, we had to- When we bought this cave, we had to sort of adopt a lot of the cave rules for this sort of maniac guy that lived in here.

There was a maniac guy that insists on you keeping up with his traditions.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

So he had a house in Los Felis, and then one day walked away from it and just walked straight into a cave in Bronson Canyon.

And that's of course- Squatter's rights, of course.

Squatter's right.

So he owns it at that point.

He owns it.

So he would go- He sort of was like, Now I have two houses.

He'd go back and forth from his Los Felis house to his cave house.

He built out the cave house, but he was like, When we're in cave house, we've got some cave rules.

And one of them is only hot tea.

Oh, only hot tea, yeah.

By the way, is this the Batman cave, which is right off of Bronson?

It's interesting, you know.

A lot of people think it's the Batman cave.

That cave sort of smells, Scoring.

Oh, it does really.

Like what?

It smells- Okay, so you know when you do like a production, you know, and then like there's all these like food trucks and there's like all this shit and then there's just garbage everywhere?

Sure, yeah.

Nobody cleaned the shit up after the Batman.

After the bat- So they just had Adam West's catering.

When you go over there, it says, Adam's West's catering.

You can still see the entire production.

They just sort of walked away from it.

It's like a zombie production town.

So the whole cave- So it's sort of like the Deadwood town?

It's sort of like the Deadwood town, but it just smells.

Was Anthony Desselnich doing accounting?

Dude, I don't know anything about that.

It's gone.

Okay, well, check it out on his IMDB.

I'm going to look that up.

Desselnich IMDB, I'm going to write that down.

Sure.

Right next to July 15th.

July 15th, what was that about?

It's probably a day that way.

Never mind, never mind.

So yes, so you're on Comedy Bang Bang.

Yes.

Now, if there's one thing about Whisper Studios, I know, is that you love to put ninjas in all of your productions.

That's right, Scott.

From three ninjas.

To two ninjas.

Two ninjas.

One ninjas.

To Beverly Hills Ninja.

Beverly Hills Chihuahua Ninja.

You know, it's a lot of that, but right now, we're trying to branch out a little bit, Scott, like I talked about before.

Right.

We're doing some other productions.

You know, we've got a pretty woman reboot.

Oh, you do?

Oh, I don't know that we talked about this.

Oh, we haven't talked about this.

Oh, the pretty woman reboot.

So what happens is, so Richard Gere, he's coming back to you.

Sir Richard Gere?

Is that what you said?

Sir Richard Gere?

He's knighted, right?

I don't believe he is.

Anyways.

The Gerbil might be.

I think he's...

That is an unsubstantiated rumor.

That might be kind of so.

But I am happy to keep going.

It's like a joke room.

He's probably in on it at this point.

Yeah, I heard he had it up there, the entire pretty woman filming.

So I think that might be something we do this time.

Okay.

I just put it in the credits.

Like, one Gerbil might have been harmed in the making of this movie.

If he had that credit in every movie that he put out, I mean, might have been.

It would be so fun.

It would have been.

Fuck with the fans, you know?

He loves fucking with the fans.

He loves him.

He loves fucking with the fans.

So anyways, this pretty woman reboot, I think maybe it was a Richard Gere.

I don't know who's in that movie.

So in this pretty woman...

Pretty woman, by the way, another movie I've never seen.

Not a scene skop.

Come out the same year as Ninja Turtles 1990s.

Did you just have a movie blackout or something?

I have to say there are certain movies that I've never seen.

Holy shit, Scott.

It did come out in 1990, Scott.

Yeah.

What was going...

Let's talk about 1990.

We should talk about it.

There are certain movies that I've never seen out of spite, out of like, they were too commercial or whatever for me at the time.

And so I've just never seen them.

Pretty woman is one of them.

Were you one of those sort of like indie kids that was like, fuck all this new movie shit, you know?

I sort of became one of those in like 1989 or so.

Like I sort of started getting taste and being very snooty.

And so from 1989 to maybe 1999, the only movies I saw were like indie movies.

And then if you look, I made a list of every movie I've seen, by the way.

That's a very Nick Weige thing.

Yeah.

And I've noticed that I would go see only indie movies and then the biggest like action blockbusters there were.

Wow.

So your Armageddon's, you're the rock, all that kind of stuff.

And then just all these indie movies.

But in any case, yeah, I never saw Pretty Woman.

So this all came about because you like to put ninjas in everything.

By the way, did we close the loop on the Pretty Woman reboot?

What is it?

Oh, I was just going to tell you.

What happens is this Richard Geer guy, he finds a sort of street worker.

I don't know what to call them.

I'm figuring that out.

Sex worker.

There we go.

Why does he street worker?

So she's like, she's not like riding in a sweet suit or something.

Yeah, you're thinking of street walker.

Actually, hold on.

But you wanted to make it a little more politically correct.

So she's not walking.

She's working.

I'm changing the whole thing.

Let me write this down.

She's driving a street sweeper.

This is not bad.

Okay.

So what about a Zamboni?

Oh, street Zamboni.

Scott, you're on.

Street Zamboni.

Okay.

So she's driving a street Zamboni.

Richard Geer sees it.

He's like, what do you pull?

Come with me.

I'm rich.

And then the movie sort of really takes off.

That's the inciting incident.

That's sort of the inciting incident.

And we're trying to keep ninjas out of it for now, but look, Scott, if we get down the road and this thing's still pretty boring.

Well, I got to say, you know, that I was reading a great column by Tom Briehan, one of my favorite writers.

I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.

But he does articles about film on AV Club and he does articles about music on Stereogum.

And he was talking about the 80s about how, for some reason, every movie in the 80s had some sort of mob mafia subplot in it.

Because the plots, the regular plots of movies in the 80s, were all these like, they captured America's fancy, so like three men and a baby.

Wow, the idea of these three guys raising a baby?

Great.

But then they realized they have not enough script.

Essentially, they don't have enough movies, so they throw a mob subplot into it.

And every movie had one.

This sounds like Sister Act, you know?

Yes, exactly.

Like throw a mob thing into it and then you have a third act.

And then you hire that one guy that was in Sopranos that sort of has that like rounded, like, hey, man, I don't even remember this guy, but he's in everything.

He was in like this movie.

Are we talking about James Gandolfini?

Yeah, did you kind of- Oh, Lorraine Rocco.

No, no, there's a guy from like the background of all these Soprano seeds.

He's also one of the goons in Cop and a Half, which is a movie about a little kid.

I feel like this is also the guy from- Okay, what did I just watch the other night?

I watched- Oh, eraser, eraser.

Arnold Schwarzenegger.

It might be the same guy from Eraser School.

He's a- There's a ludicrous subplot in Eraser where Arnold Schwarzenegger, who plays the titular eraser.

Of course.

And whose catchphrase is, you've just been erased.

Sick movie.

Which by the way, the villain turns it back around on him when he's on a computer and he's like trying to download the information, which in the 90s, that was the third act of any 90s movie, is downloading the information.

It was like 10 on the computer.

Like, figure it out.

96% almost there.

And he's downloading the information and the villain turns it back around on him by talking to the guy in charge of the computers at the building going like, is he in there?

Find him, find him.

And then suddenly the eraser, the titular eraser, before he can download the information, a screen comes up that says, you've just been erased.

And then guys burst in and kill him.

And I'm like trying to think of the sequence of events with the villain where he goes, okay, you found him?

Now, can you program something in there?

So his screen sees his own catchphrase.

Is that possible for you?

And if that takes a few minutes, we've got time.

Like- He's only at 97%.

He's still got 3% to download.

So we're okay.

It's so crazy to be- But in any case, there's a ludicrous subplot about the mafia on the docks there.

And is this the guy that we're thinking of the guy?

I'm trying to figure out who it is, but he's literally in every Bob Big ever.

This guy- How is this?

How is that?

He must have been so pissed when they like- Analyzed with a bit- Wiffle Ball bat?

Yeah, exactly.

Sure.

He must have been so pissed when they stopped- this is Bob's subplot thing you're talking about, Scotty.

Oh, it was the glory.

Well, that's the thing.

Like all these mob guys had- It was just salad days for so long in the 80s.

And then suddenly in the 90s, it dries up a little bit, but then Sopranos comes around, and then you're like- Whoa!

Buffungoo!

Oh, Sopranos!

You know, Sopranos is sort of the like- It's sort of the Game of Thrones for British actors.

You know, it's like- Game of Thrones for British actors is Sopranos to just like mafia- Italian- Americans.

Exactly, yeah.

They're all in it.

It's so great that that- Yeah, or it's like- a law in order for New York actors.

They're like Broadway people.

Exactly.

Or like Comedy Bang Bang for like, indie comedians.

Sure, yeah.

Well, I would like that.

If somehow it were considered to be the Sopranos of- It was the Sopranos of the sort of Indian-LA comedy community.

The- Serial was the first podcast.

That was the train coming straight towards the camera.

And then cut to Comedy Bang Bang being the Sopranos of podcasts.

I appreciate it.

Congratulations, Scotty.

But we brought up this mob thing because we were just talking about- I love putting ninjas off in movies, of course.

We may need to add ninjas in order to do what we're talking about into this pretty woman reboot.

We'll figure it out, Scotty.

We'll figure it out.

But right now we're figuring out a main project which we've been- We're just trying on- We're way behind on the turtle, Scotty.

So what happened was we were talking about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which came up on the show.

And I realized that I have no connection to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise.

I have barely seen anything regarding them.

And all I had in my mind was one mental image.

I'm shaking my damn head, Scotty.

Already.

You certainly are.

And it's this.

It's that I- And I inquired as to whether this happened in the movie, whether I saw it in a commercial.

I don't know where I pulled this from.

But the Ninja Turtles, at some point, they see a manhole cover and it's circular, so they think it's a pizza.

So they bite down on it and say, ow!

And maybe they break their teeth.

That's the one image that I had from it.

This was some fever dream you had, Scotty.

After like sort of maybe falling asleep, trying to watch Secret of the Us or something.

I just never tried to watch any of these movies.

I don't know anything about them.

It's crazy to me that that would be your- the lasting mental image.

It's like, you're not even- there's an iconic song, you know?

There's sort of the weapons they use.

There's the toys.

You didn't even see the toy, Scot.

There's a huge part.

Didn't see the toys.

We- I can- I've done some thinking on it since then.

And I can take you back and tell you a little bit about what I know about the franchise.

Let's figure this out.

Because if you're going to be writing this new script for the reboot, you sort of have to know the Turtles, Scotty.

So let's see what you know.

Okay, so here's what I know.

Back in the 80s, I of course was reading a lot of comic books as a teenager.

And the three hottest comic books that were around in the 80s were the Uncanny X-Men and they were mutants.

Okay.

You have the New Teen Titans, the Marvel Wolf Man and George Perez, New Teen Titans.

Those were the two hottest franchises, one being Marvel, one being DC.

They even teamed up for a comic book when they did a crossover.

Those were the two most popular.

You also had Frank Miller doing Daredevil.

Okay.

And there were a lot of ninjas in Daredevil.

So wait, Scot, Scot, what are you getting at here?

What I'm getting at is when I did hear about the comic book, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

And when I heard about it, knowing those three properties, I thought, oh, this is a parody of those three books.

It's like a kid's comic that's parodying these three hot trends in comic books.

And so I never picked up the comic.

I heard things about it.

I think it was in black and white.

That's all I really know about it.

And I just never picked it up.

And then when the first movie came out in 1990, I was 19 years old.

And it seemed like it was a kid's movie, especially with, I do believe I knew Corey Feldman was hired to do a voice.

It seemed like a kid's movie to me.

And so I stayed away from it.

Now cut to, I want to say 2014, somewhere around here, 2013, 2014.

This is a major cut to.

I know this is.

First of all, Scot, you just did a whole cut to incorporating my entire life.

I was born and I have now been to the day, to 2014.

That's like my whole freaking life.

Okay.

I, 2014, I'm sitting there in the comedy bang bang television writers room for, I want to say, the third season.

And the writers really want us to do a bit based on the teenage mutant ninja turtles going on the Oprah Winfrey show.

Right.

Of course.

Classic clip.

So we, I know we watched that and, and tried to figure out some sort of take on it.

And I think one of them drank water at a certain point and it was dribbling.

Okay.

So maybe the manhole pizza thing is from that.

Okay.

That's the only thing that I've seen them actually physically do.

If the ninja turtles bit into a manhole on the Oprah Winfrey show, I'll eat my shoe.

Okay.

Will you break your teeth and say, ow, ow, ow.

I'll be like, is this a pizza?

And then I'll, I'll chomp into it, break my teeth because that Scott is insane.

I, I have the image in my head and that's the only place it could have come from.

The only other teenage mutant ninja turtles connection that I have is probably in 2014, 2015, somewhere around there.

I was doing during Comic Con, I was doing a live comedy bang bang episode.

And a live show in front of a great audience, Aquafina open for us.

It was a, it was a great show.

And two people came to the show and they had been texting me and saying they wanted to come to the show.

And they were under the impression that at Comic Con, even at night, off site, everyone was dressed in costume all the time.

Oh, I think I know where this is going.

They came to the show dressed as teenage mutant ninja turtles and then found out that no one was dressed up there.

This was Tatiana Maslani and Christian Bruin.

This sounds like a Bruin thing.

I'll say I did any of you.

Bruin.

It's a very Bruin thing.

I did any of you Bruin on my, my Patreon podcast and let's just say this is part of the course of Christian.

Yes, exactly.

So now it was keeping Tatiana from being recognized, although who knows if the comedy bang bang audience would have flipped overseeing her, but this is, this is right in the middle of orphan black fever.

So she was able to go unrecognized and we got some funny, funny pictures of them dressed in these teenage mutant ninja turtles costumes, which I don't even think, come to think of it.

I think they were masks and maybe like, you know how when you used to buy a Halloween costume when you were a kid and maybe you didn't have this experience, but I did growing up in the 1970s, you would get these prepackaged costumes at the grocery store and it would, like if it were Spiderman, you would have the mask of Spiderman and it would be a plastic mask with a rubber band, sta-, stapled to two sides.

But then the body wouldn't be Spiderman's body.

It would be like pictures of Spiderman fighting.

I don't, I don't remember this Scott.

What I remember is sort of a loose fitting cloth, cloth, like sort of like, this is what Spiderman would wear to the gym or something.

I think it graduated from there, from where I'm talking about, but early on in my youth, that's what I remember is, is you would always be disappointed like, well, couldn't you make the whole body look like Spiderman?

And instead it was just like, like cartoon pictures of Spiderman fighting and you'd have that.

It feels harder to do the pictures of Spiderman.

It's like so much work to like lay out a sort of t-shirt comic with Spiderman.

That's what I said or that's what she said.

I don't know which one applies in this.

I mean, she might have said it.

We don't even know who she is.

So those are, those are my connections to the turtles.

This is tricky.

That's all I know.

This is tricky because we hired you to write the new turtles.

Not knowing any of this.

I sort of was like, this is a comic book guy he's going to know.

You know, you mentioned all those other comics.

Don't know how they're related to the turtles quite exactly, but it's funny to me that you don't know anything about the turtles because to be honest, I feel like this shit's right in your wheelhouse, baby.

Well, look, I mean, like I said, I love those three comics.

So if the turtles is anything like those three comics, then, you know, I'm in.

But at the same time.

So you did end up reading the comics at a certain point?

No, I never did.

I mean, those comics, when I say those comics, I mean, of course.

Oh, the X-Men.

Right, right.

Teen Titans Daredevil.

Exactly.

So yeah.

So, no, I've never read any of the comics.

I've never seen any of the movies.

Those three things are the only things my only connection to the turtles.

Well, what's interesting, Scott, is the comic was famously dark.

It was like four adults and not kids, you know?

Really?

Shredder is killed in the first comics cut.

I think the first issue.

I think they cut his head off of something in the first issue.

Wow.

It's insane, Scott.

And yeah, you're right.

It is derived from Daredevil, of course.

And of course, Teen Titans and X-Men, that's a part of it.

And it did sort of start as a parody, Scott.

But, you know, a lot of things start as a parody.

For instance, this podcast.

Sure.

And now it's Serious AF.

This podcast is Serious AF.

I'm recording.

I've got my quick time going.

This whole thing is working, Scott.

Sure.

Don't knock a parody.

That's all I'm saying.

Sure.

I mean, your best, your friends with all, where else got?

Yeah, no, that's true.

And you know what?

I mean, Spyhard maybe started as a parody, but then it, you know, it's legitimately probably my, if it were a James Bond film, it would be my favorite James Bond film.

I go to agree.

I don't, I don't love the James Bond franchise, Scott.

You don't really throw an engine in there.

That's what I'm saying.

It's he, this, this old white guy is too good at beating people up.

This is a guy who's not a fine.

He doesn't do anything.

You realize it's been several different white guys.

It's not just one guy who's really old right now.

No, you know what's got, they're all old.

They all suck.

It's just like, get out of here.

You know, they're all women-ized as the drinking too much.

Just so if it were, if it were a young person of color, you'd be into it.

First of all, okay.

So if we were re-baking James Bond, first of all, E.J.S. Elvis would have been James Bond years ago.

Could you have a hair as ago?

Yeah.

Although Daniel Stringenbell- Yeah, Daniel Craig is the best James Bond.

So it's- Yeah.

I guess he is, but you know what?

E.J.S. Elvis, you would have been the Black James Bond.

Sure.

I mean, couldn't you?

Here's the thing.

Daniel Craig takes five years in between James Bond films.

It's like, get E.J.S. in there to do the off years.

That's what I'm, we should do- Okay. We should have- The way that they have Star Wars, there should be like a main canon.

Yes.

And then like side boots.

Secondary canon, yeah.

It's like, oh yeah.

This is the James Bond that's sort of like, you know, in Los Angeles, just sort of chilling.

And what, and you know, why couldn't it just be James Bond's friend?

006.

006?

James Brown.

Well 006, I believe is the bad guy in Golden Eye, but maybe it's 004.

004, who gives a shit?

006.

I'm realizing James Brown is probably not the best.

Not the best name for him.

Probably not.

Well look, I think it's still fun.

It's one of those comic book Easter eggs.

We're going to get into that a little bit later, Scott.

Easter or eggs?

A little bit of both.

Oh boy.

So Scott, he was risen.

I told you that this was an emergency podcast on two prongs, because one, you've not heard of turtles at all.

And two- Now we've been down that prong.

Yes.

We've been down on that prong for a long time.

We've been down on that prong, baby.

But the other emergency was sort of, I've been listening to Coverdy Bang Bang recently.

And I feel like we sort of need to exercise this Ninja Turtles thing from the pod, because every time I listen, I like 37 Skip to the Middle, that's the way I listen to podcast.

And as soon as it starts, it's like turtles.

It's like, I feel like I've cursed you to talk about turtles on every episode of your show.

Yeah, I would, I don't want to talk about the turtles.

I've never seen the turtles.

I don't know anything about the turtles.

So I'm glad I would prefer not to talk about the turtles anymore.

So let's try to get it out on this show.

Well, Scott, we have to stop talking about TMNT on CBB, baby.

Thank you.

Yes.

That's the name of the pod, Scott.

And let me just say, as an Ninja Turtles super fan, I'm here to guide you through the canon, of course.

Great.

And I want to, of course, make sure you feel comfortable when I send you off on script with this, because if not, I mean, we might have to find this.

We might have to find this July again.

Is there like a well-defined outline?

Like, okay, yes, we've talked about the beat for beat outline on the other pod.

Now go through it pretty quickly.

Scene one, April O'Neill's dead.

It's a funeral.

This is a continuation of the films, much like Superman Returns.

Sort of.

So the way that Terminator sort of cut out a bunch of the older canon and just started after two, we're going to be doing the exact same thing.

Okay.

This is the most recent Terminator, which was sub-titled.

South-vision turtles.

No, Salvation was the Christian Bale one, as I recall, where he yelled at the guy, the gaffer or the guy moving the...

Yeah, when he was like, I'm trying to be professional man.

He's a really asshole.

The guy moving the Terminator?

Was he moving a Terminator out of the way?

I think he was moving the big, like, metal Terminator with the red eye.

He was like, I'm trying to get it into his frame.

You're telling me I can't do my job?

I think it's dark fate.

Is it terminal to dark fate?

Dark fate, yes.

I believe so.

Yeah, I think I just saw it.

So we're doing sort of that with the turtles.

And beat for beat, April O'Neill's dead in the beginning.

You don't know what the turtles are.

That is a doorknob.

One turtle shows up to the funeral.

He doesn't have his colors.

You don't know which turtle it is.

And the colors are the way you distinguish the turtles?

That's right, Scott.

We'll get into that in the next segment.

I'm going to teach you the whole thing.

But beat for beat, he shows up.

He doesn't have his colors.

You don't know who it is.

It's an older turtle.

Maybe it's like 1999 or something.

And he's an older turtle.

He's grizzled, you know.

Is he worried about Y2K?

He's worried about Y2K.

He's totally freaking out.

He's like, I don't even want to have a computer.

Those plots from the 90s are always says.

So what happens is April O'Neill's daughter, of course, is tasked to figure out who this turtle guy that showed up to her mother's funeral is.

And she finds out all the rest of the turtles are dead.

No.

That's right.

All the turtles are dead.

And she finds the lamp from the third one, which brings them back in time.

We'll talk about that.

I don't even want to know about this at this point.

But there's a video game called Turtles in Time.

And what happens is this older turtle has to go back in time, Avengers endgame style.

Back in time.

He's got to go back in time.

Scott, I think I'm going to write that down.

I feel like every time we talk about it.

What are you writing down?

I'm writing notes because I'm a note taker.

But what exactly are you writing?

I'm writing back in time, right above July 15th.

Okay.

Back in time, July 15th, that'll help me figure out what's happening after this.

So they go back in time of Avengers endgame style.

They rescue younger turtles.

And then he rescues a younger version of himself.

You find out it's Raphael.

And then Raphael becomes the new splinter.

And he is now the sort of splinter for the new turtles that we read, boot him for ninja turtles too.

Okay.

I don't know.

I mean, at this point, I have no connection to any of this stuff.

We're going to have to figure it out, Scott.

But a lot of the story beats play out in the first movie, Scott.

So I think we go to...

Should I watch it now or what do I do?

So I'm going to sit you down in our sort of bullpen over there.

I guess we just...

We call it a bull's hand, but it's a corner of a cave.

Yeah.

And caves traditionally don't have corners.

And for some reason, this is like a 90 degree angle corner.

I don't know how you got it in here.

It was like $45,000 to get some guys to chip in a corner here.

So we could put a...

Because you wanted a corner office?

Well, I wanted a corner office and then we had to be able to put up a flat screen.

And if you try to put up a flat screen on a curved surface, you wanted some big issues, Scott.

Those curved TVs, though, that someone thought was going to be all the rage.

Remember that from about 365 days ago?

I'll be honest, the only people who kickstarted that thing were people who live in caves.

And then when we realized we weren't going to buy the TV, the whole thing folded was a big mistake, Scott.

Yeah, I understand.

So I'm going to sit you in the corner, you're going to watch Ninja Turtles 1, Scott, and then we're going to come back and we're going to do a breakdown.

So we can get into the script.

Is that okay?

That sounds fine to me.

Yeah, let's...

All right, let's take a break.

Okay, and then I'm hosting the pod, Scott.

So let me let me throw the commercial.

What I want to say, though, is when we come back, I will have watched the movie.

You will have watched the movie, and I'm going to throw it to commercial the way I sort of know how.

Okay, here we go.

How do you throw the commercial?

All right.

All right, we'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang.

All right, and we're back on...

We have to stop talking TMNT on CBB, and Scott Okemin just watched Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1 from 1990.

Scott, how are you feeling?

Um...

That's not a good sign.

When you ask someone...

Not feeling great.

When you ask someone how they're feeling, and their first response is a long um...

You're not starting out great there.

Ah...

Not what I expected.

I have to say, especially since what I expected was with you saying, you're going to love it.

Okay, Scott, let's...

What did you expect going in?

Because I think that's interesting, because a lot of people don't remember what this movie was like.

I think I expected a certain level of craftsmanship that perhaps was not demonstrated in this first film.

Now, I think that's absolutely insane, Scott.

How dare you?

All right.

So I guess I expected it to be...

It was so popular.

I guess I expected it to be like a crocodile Dundee 1, which you know, had a level of competency that perhaps this film uh...

sidestepped.

Interesting.

So you're saying it's an incompetent, stupid movie that no one should have liked.

All right, we'll have to...

We have a long way to go before you start writing this script, but I think...

I really want to talk to you about this, Scott, because I will say...

I watched it...

So I was in the kitchen behind you sort of watching you watch it.

Yeah, with Dyda.

With Dyda, of course.

And you know, Scott, I...

I love this movie so much, and I think the problem...

If you think this one is bad, Scott, weird.

Weird.

Oh no.

Here's what I assumed after watching this.

I assumed that number two, the first one was such a hit that they're going to get an influx of money and be able to make it a little more like...

You know, put...

Throw some money at it, and whereas it might lose some of the magic of the original, whatever that may be, at least it would look better.

That is exactly what happened, Scott.

But the uncanny value of these turtles, when they start making them look better, by three, Scott, it's like a Sonic the Hedgehog situation where you're like, the teeth are weird.

I don't like the way they look.

Oh no.

But I will say, Scott...

Okay.

So for me, Ninja Turtles one is the best Ninja Turtles movie.

It's the best Ninja Turtles thing that it exists.

Whoa.

And I watched it by...

Can I ask...

Can I ask something about it?

Of course.

Yes.

Was there a children's cartoon that came out?

So let's talk about that real quick.

So before the movie, there was the comic book, which was very dark and for adults, but they were trying to make some toys for this.

And in order to make toys, back in the day, you had to have a cartoon, baby.

Sure.

So they produced a cartoon, and the cartoon is much different than the movie.

And it's a lot different than the comic books.

The cartoon is where they developed the different colors for the turtles.

Okay.

And the colors are what...

What identifies them?

On their masks, of course.

Okay.

And in the comics...

They were...

This is something that I couldn't quite tell from the movie.

Are they wearing masks at home?

I guess I wasn't clocking it.

They never take off the mask.

I guess it's like a T-shirt to them.

Oh, okay.

A T-shirt.

Well, they already have a shell, which is sort of a Turtles T-shirt.

The shell is the Turtles T-shirts.

It's hard for me to write you off this project, because you just come up with fun jokes like that all the time.

Oh, they're definitely more fun than the jokes that are in this film, which I want to talk about.

So we'll talk about the jokes.

There's some definite bad jokes in this.

But so the thing about this movie that's interesting is, it's of course a very low budget film.

You've talked about that, Scott.

Yeah.

Okay.

So the first thing that comes up is you see Golden Harvest, which is a classic Asian cinema studio.

They're a Hong Kong stunt and film studio.

Recently, I have watched quite a few Golden Harvest movies, including Police Story 1 and 2.

Ooh.

Love those Jackie Chan.

Those are some of the best Jackie Chan films, because they just don't give a shit about it.

Explain it.

It's just all action.

I love those.

Yes.

And they don't give a shit about anyone's safety.

Yeah.

It's just like everyone's.

Including the public at large.

Right.

But also, you know, Bruce Lee.

So I'm guessing and I don't know anything about these films, but I'm guessing that, okay, here's...

So it was a comic book and it was a cartoon.

I'm guessing that Golden Harvest got the foreign rights to do the movie and started filming the movie as a Golden Harvest production.

And then from what you said in the intro, New Line acquired it.

Is that what happened?

New Line acquired it about halfway through production.

And I believe you're right, this, Scott.

I believe it was the same team that brought the cartoons.

It was literally all about the toys, Scott.

You know, we're selling toys.

If you see that show on Netflix, the toys that made us.

There's a great Ninja Turtles episode.

Oh, no.

I mean, we should do an episode about that.

We should do it, if it's up on that, we got to talk about it.

But it's a...

Well, by the way, for people listening, we're doing all the movies here.

I don't even think we made that clear.

I don't think we made it clear either.

This is just one in a series.

This is one in a series.

Scott fucked up and said, let's watch all the Ninja Turtles movie.

A Daoist sort of cast.

Yeah, I think I even said the modern ones.

And I'm like, this is a big mistake, Scott.

But I'll, I'll be here for you, maybe.

Okay, I don't know.

I don't know how, if at any point this podcast even ends in the middle of the show, it will be because we cannot stand doing it.

It would just be because Scott says, you know, it fucked this.

I'm looking out of the cave.

This, this, this.

This may happen with the Red Hot Chili Peppers show.

It may happen with this show.

At a certain point, we may just say, call it off and go.

Scott Ockerman, a man who grades podcasts, he needs to think about walking away from.

Yes, the fish show, it certainly happened there.

So yes, this was a low budget film, Scott, and it was golden harvest, but it was the toy guys that were like, we got to keep moving.

We've got to make a live action movie.

So it was all sort of a orchestration from the entire IP, which was Mirage Studios, which is Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman.

The comic book writers.

So they were like, let's make this movie.

Nobody wanted to make it because of Masters of the Universe.

That was a huge flop.

Oh, that's right.

I never saw that either, but it came out earlier.

It was a huge flop, and there was some other comic book.

Super Mario Brothers, did that come out?

I think that came out later, much later.

Another one I have not seen.

Yeah, and we'll do an app on that.

Now the, the, what, what, okay, all right, Scott, you know, we signed a contract, so I got to do whatever I want.

Now, what happened is they made this movie, and it was, they got a director from England.

And I want to talk to you about this director, Scott.

Now the director, I, weirdly enough, I think, I think the writer that I was talking about before, Tom Briehan, I was reading his column before we started doing this show.

And he was, the column that he writes is all about, he takes the number one single on the Billboard charts, and he's reviewing every single one since the chart started.

Oh, that's, that's a great.

So he's currently in the early 80s, and I was reading it recently, and he mentioned that the video director for whatever song it was, I can't remember what the song was, I can look it up, was a, was a sort of veteran music video director who then got hired to direct the first teenage mutant into Turtles movie.

Yes, so we're talking about Steve Barron, and I'll tell you the songs, the popular songs that he directed the music videos for.

Okay. Billy Jean.

Oh, the classic, classic video, and you could sort of think about the like street element to it, and show her, yeah, I'm sure he'll do his Turtles movie, and then take on me.

And then also, also think about the young kids in this teenage mutant into Turtles movie, that applies to Michael Jackson as well.

Well, you know, Scott, that, we're gonna, we're gonna cut that out.

You know, Scott, I, what, why are we gonna, are you super fan?

I'm a, I like to separate the music from the, all right, let's order you to get it done.

So, Scott, this guy directed Take on Me as well, Scott.

Take on Me, this is the song, this is the one that I read about.

And this is the video.

This is one of the best videos of all time.

Can you describe it, Scott?

Because I do think it's important to sort of set this director up.

So the Swedish band, or Norwegian band, I can't recall, aha, which is the H is capitalized after a dash, but the A is lowercase, both A's are lowercase.

They have a song Take on Me, which everyone knows, which in the video, I believe a woman is drawing a comic book that stars the lead singer of aha, and then she gets pulled into the comic book, I believe, and it comes to life.

Is that, is that- I believe that's right.

That's why it happens.

It was one of the first, first music videos with incredible special effects.

It was incredible, Scott.

And it's the iconic drawn video, and it's just the song and the video just go hand in hand.

And I guess this guy then decided to make a sloppy ass movie where there was no thought put into it, I guess.

I don't know.

The teenage mutant into turtles.

Yeah, you know, he also directed cone heads, Scott.

Do you like that movie?

Oh boy.

Okay, well, I will say I've never seen cone heads either.

Scott, this is disgusting.

I have a soundtrack.

How do you like the soundtrack?

Soundtrack has Bear Naked Ladies fight the power, I believe, and it also has Red Hot Tilly Pepper Soul to squeeze, which may come up on my other show.

Please bring up cone heads on your other show.

I do believe we may.

But yeah, it is interesting.

When I think of Billy Jean and Take On Me, those are two of the most classic music videos and they look expensive and they were big, big hits.

And then this movie, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, seems to have none of that professional sheen on it.

Right, right.

I guess let's talk about the turtles, Scott and the suits.

Sure.

Because I guess those were made by this unprofessional sort of dick guy, this sort of loser guy.

I guess his name was Jim Henson.

Oh.

Yeah, I guess Jimi Henson made the turtle.

So I guess this whole thing was sloppy and unthought.

Look, Scott, what I'm saying is you're out of your damn mind.

Okay, Jim Henson made the turtle costumes.

Now they were a nightmare to wear.

You mentioned that this production, this Hong Kong production studio was sort of notorious for people getting hurt in their movies.

Right.

So these turtle suits are one of the, there's seven, we're gonna have to figure this out, Scott, because they weighed like 70 pounds and the actors wearing them in North Carolina were like having panic attacks from claustrophobia.

That's right.

I saw in the credits, it said it was shot primarily in North Carolina.

That's right.

In the summer, when these guys are wearing 70 pound suits with animatronics and machines running on the inside and doing fight choreography.

And were they controlling the animatronics or was there?

There was the real control.

I think it was remote control.

There was like multiple people per turtle.

So they're not expected to be puppeteers during this as well.

They're just moving around.

And I read somewhere that each of them lost about 20 pounds doing shooting.

And people complained about the shooting on set.

So right now we're in suit development, Scott.

And that's gonna take like, because we're doing a live action version, of course.

Yeah, we don't want to do the apparently, the recent ones are CGI, is that right?

And so we don't want to do that.

It's sort of like a Star Wars thing.

I'll keep going back to that.

Like the original like tactile feel of a Star Wars movie.

You got the guy in the devil mask, sort of like the Spider-Man Halloween costume.

He's got the devil all over his, all over his pajama body.

You've got devil guy.

And then you get to the new stuff and it's all CGI.

You got like a CGI ET in the background.

It's like, fuck off with that stuff.

Yeah.

And the new movies, they go back to some more practical effects.

And I think that's what we're doing here with the turtles.

Okay, great.

So were they shorter actors in the...

So they were adults?

They were adults, Scott.

And the only actor who played, who actually did the voice and was in the costume, is I got to look up his name because you'll know this actor.

I think his name is Pius.

Steve Pius or something?

Yeah, is that the guy who's in the taxi cab?

Yes, that's the guy in the taxi cab.

So all he said...

I saw him in the taxi cab and I'm like, oh, that guy is a well-known character actor, or not even a character actor, just like a well-known actor who's been in a million things.

I'm like, what is he doing in this?

And then I saw in the credits, that his name came up twice as the voice of one of the turtles and as the guy in the taxi cab.

But you're saying he was in the suit as well?

He was also...

He was the only one that was in the suit.

Feltman, I believe, just did the voice over.

And then there were like, Stuntman that were in the suits that also made cameos in the movie.

Like, for instance...

Okay.

I believe the like...

I believe the Domino's Pizza Guy, delivering the pizza in Act 1, is Michelangelo.

Which, by the way, I have to say, speaking of the pizza...

Yeah.

At four minutes and 23 seconds in the movie, that's the first time that you see a manhole cover.

And I got excited.

Okay, all right.

I thought...

Here we go!

I saw him...

That just doesn't remember it.

I saw a lot of the notes you were taking, and they were like, manhole cover, four minutes in.

And I was like, Sculptpix, not what we're doing.

Well, then at eight minutes in, is the first mention of pizza?

I mean, this is...

Isn't this a big part of them?

Yeah, it's a big part.

I don't know anything about them.

So the pizza was actually added to the cartoon.

It's not a part of the comics at all.

Oh!

So wait, so it goes comics, no pizza.

Cartoon, they love pizza.

And then movie, they love pizza as well.

And then movie, they love pizza.

Sort of amalgamation of the comics and the movie, Scott.

The movie I have...

The movie I have to say, is sort of feels like a movie where it's like, hey, you know everything about the turtles already, right?

Like, we don't have to go through this.

Really? So you don't think that...

Okay, Scott.

So just in the beginning of the movie, you know, I do think they do a good job of setting up New York City.

Well, how hard do you have to try?

It's the fifth character of so many movies.

Well, the first short is the Twin Towers.

And then...

Yes, so we're on shaky ground right there.

Shaky ground, but you know it's New York City.

Then the next shot, I think, is like a subway or something.

And you're like, all right, we're in New York City.

Yeah, this is definitely New York City.

Which...

So they said...

Yes.

You know, being as it was shot in North Carolina, you know, they have to sort of cover that up.

There was like three days of shooting in New York City, actually.

And they just shot all the beginning and end of the movie there.

Great.

But they do a good job of setting up.

But Scott, I think in Act 1, you know, in April, of course, we're going to go...

I'll go through the plot loosely here, but April O'Neill is mugged in the beginning and is saved by the turtles.

And I don't know that she's mugged in the beginning, by the way.

She...

It was pretty late mugging as far.

But the movie is structured.

It kind of...

Here's what I think.

Okay.

Tell me if I'm right.

Okay.

In 1989, Batman comes out, right?

Mm-hmm.

And it's a huge, huge hit.

And so everyone thinks in order to make a comic book movie, we have to structure it like Batman.

Now, Batman is structured kind of weirdly...

Interesting.

Where Batman starts with Batman literally foiling a crime.

And you don't know how Batman came to be until the midpoint of the movie.

Right.

And you see the Jack Nicholson shooting, spoiler alert, by the way, if you haven't seen him shooting...

Is that the big long gun?

Yeah, probably.

I can't remember the long gun.

I mean, personally, I look at it.

I'm like, oh, that's a regular-sized gun, but you think it's long.

Interesting.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'll go a little dick, Scott.

That's canon.

By the way, we're changing canon nonstop during this thing, so if you'd better be catching up.

Okay.

Sorry, joke.

So in any case, I saw this movie, and I'm like, oh, they are kind of approaching it from a...

You already know everything you need to know about the turtles.

We'll get to all of the stuff that's there canon, like later on down the road, to the point where I, a person who knows nothing about the turtles, was barely bored and confused in the beginning because there wasn't a lot of dramatic momentum.

Okay, so let me explain to you what a master stroke is, Scott.

Oh, okay.

Thank you.

A master stroke is when a writer does something so subtle and so nuanced and so powerful that you look back and you're like, that was a master stroke, baby?

Hmm.

And to me, first of all, the first speaking scene of the movie outside of April O'Neill's report is her getting mugged, and she does get mugged by Sam Rockwell.

Right.

But there's a lot of movie before that, but okay.

Okay, I mean, look, Scott, I can tell you beat for beat every single thing that happened, but she gets robbed and the turtles save her, and then the reason I know this is the beginning, Scott, is because once they're celebrating saving her, is when the title drop happens.

Yeah, okay.

So I feel like we may need to watch...

We're gonna do an episode two where you re-watch, because I feel like he's sort of missed a lot.

So the master stroke I wanted to tell you about, Scott, is when April O'Neill is down with the turtles, she's now been saved for a second time by April O'Neill, by Raphael, and she's been brought to their lair, and then Splinter has to explain who the turtles are.

And in that scene, the background fades to black, and we get a sort of explanation of the turtle backstory.

I mean...

Yes, we do the whole thing.

No, he doesn't give you the whole thing.

Okay, so first of all, by the way, why is it shot?

Like, this is the kind of directed take on me.

Why is it shot like the shittiest 35 millimeter home movie that I've ever seen?

I want to go back to the shooting style for the new movie, just to like...

Just for that?

Yeah, you know the way they did like...

I can't go into Star Wars, but they brought the wipes back in the new ones, and to me, I wanna bring back the feel that you're watching this on a green videotape.

It looks so bad, but here's the thing I wanna say.

The whole splinter backstory, he in this flashback that you're talking about, he's like, first of all, can we just talk about the fact that he's doing an Asian accent?

So it's Kevin Clash.

So we've got to talk about the problematic nature of this movie.

Yes, a lot of problematic things that don't necessarily hold up.

April O'Neill makes a joke about Sony payments when she gets robbed, and I create a buy by Asian...

No, when Asian people come to Rob, she's like, what am I late on my Sony payments?

It's insane!

It's insane, and I truly...

We're not working with any of that bullshit in the universe.

The splinter voice, at least he's a person of color, at least he's...

It's Kevin Clash, of course, the voice of Elmo, and he's doing a sort of like, sensei voice, and yes, it is problematic scott.

Yes, but I mean, here's the thing, they probably just didn't wanna give it to an Asian person because he's the puppeteer and he's a talented guy.

It literally was a sort of package deal.

If you were gonna get him to do the thing, he had to do the voice at night.

So, in any case, but he just says like, okay, I had a master who I used to follow along with his secret ninjitsu moves in my cage.

Then we had to go to New York, and I was fending for myself in the sewers.

There's a lot in between there that he is...

You're right, Scott, but this is what I like to call for shadowing, Scott, because the question is answered with the next flashback.

But my problem is that next flashback is really good, and it hooked me into their story, but because it's structured like Batman, which is the only movie that could be successful as a comic book, they have it way late.

If you put that at the beginning, I'm hooked, baby.

I think you're right, Scott.

In watching it behind you, I was sort of like, these flashbacks are a little out of order, you know?

She might as well just told April O'Neill the whole story.

He's like, look, okay, so I'm gonna get to the turtle thing in a second, but...

Right.

I'm gonna be the first you gotta know about me.

Look, I'm a giant talking rat.

That's weird too, right?

That to me is the first thing we've got to figure out.

And how did I become their dad?

Like, that whole thing needs to get explained.

Sure.

But Scott, I will say those flashback scenes, I love them.

I love the style of like, old black shadowy background and the like...

Everything out of focus.

Out of focus, you know, it's really dark.

Like, imagine kids going to see this movie, and there's a splinted character telling a story where it was like, they were in love with the same woman.

So he followed her to New York and killed her and killed him.

It's like, yo, this shit is dark as hell, Scott.

Okay, I mean, I will say it seemed more juvenile than I thought it was going to.

Why?

Because a little rat started doing like chops and stuff.

That feels like childlike to you?

The whole thing seemed very like aimed at six-year-olds.

I also like in the second flashback when he's in America and he comes home from work.

He's wearing like a...

He's wearing like he was working in a coal mine or something.

Right.

He takes off his construction ad.

It's very funny.

But I have to ask about that.

There's a moment in there where one of the turtles, and I could not tell you the turtle's names, by the way.

We'll go through that right now.

But one of them comes out of the movie Critters.

He meets some time off and he goes...

He goes to see the movie Critters and he walks out of it saying, where do they come up with this stuff?

I literally scold what I saw that when I watched it behind you watching that.

I was like, I totally forgot about this part.

What a weird part.

Why are they taking a shot at Critters?

Like, a new figure.

Do I have to make Critters or do the same film?

I don't even think so.

To be honest, I think it might have been like a diss or something.

It was so strange.

It might be a thing of like, hey, look, we know Critters is out there.

We just got to acknowledge it.

We're similar to Critters.

It's like to put on a movie and not acknowledge Critters, they're going to get in trouble, you think?

So they had to add this seed.

I have a feeling they shot that months later, they're like, fuck, we got to address the Critters thing.

We got to go look.

This is every note we're getting back at testing.

Yeah, I like this better when it was called Critters.

The only reshoot we've got to do is Critters.

So yes, I don't know why that was in the movie, but I'll just walk you through the plot very quickly.

It's a three-act movie.

The first movie, the first act is where you're introduced to April O'Neill.

You're introduced to the Turtles.

And Raphael is sort of clashing with the rest of the Turtles.

And this is sort of Raphael's canon.

He's always the loner, you know?

He is, okay.

And he's upset.

I couldn't quite figure out why he was upset.

I know he lost his thing.

Well, he's upset.

He lost his sigh, but he's ultimately upset because Splinter gets kidnapped when he leads one of the foot clan back to their lair when he saves April O'Neill.

Sure.

Okay, but I don't know why he's so upset when he goes to see that movie other than he lost his sigh.

He was pissed that he lost his sigh.

Scott, have you ever tried to get a sigh?

Look, I have to agree.

This is hard.

He's even one sigh his heart.

He had two and they matched and then he lost one because of the woman he didn't think he'd ever see again.

Like, dude, I'd be pissed too, Scott.

Yeah.

What I like about how pissed he is due is how many times he says, damn.

Did you notice that?

I guess I didn't notice that.

Yeah, you're right.

I mean, the first line of any turtle in the movie is...

Damn.

And then he like goes into the sewer.

It's very strange.

Well, they all...

Let's talk about their personalities because...

Yes.

From what I could tell, one is like a surfer, dude.

Okay.

You're talking about Michelangelo.

And Scott, it's important to know that the cartoon was the one that sort of set the personalities.

They did.

Okay.

They did.

And have you ever heard the song for the cartoon, Scott?

No, I have not.

So I'm going to ask you to listen to the song, but interesting fact about the song, Written and Recorded by Chuck Laurie.

Oh, the two and a half men guy.

The mega producer, Chuck Laurie.

One of the...

Did he make a ton of money off the cartoon?

And that's why he has just a ton of time sitting around and writing sitcoms?

I'd have to look, but I couldn't see why not.

I mean, truly the song is the reason the whole thing is popular.

So he describes the turtles in a song.

And basically it goes as follows.

Michelangelo is cool.

He's a party, dude.

Okay.

Raphael is cool, but rude.

Okay, they're both cool.

All right.

That's good, Kevin.

Leonardo, he's cool, but he's the leader.

He's cool, but he's the leader.

Yeah.

And then...

So that's like...

Okay, he's cool, but he's the leader.

Why the but?

And why not Anne?

I don't know if that's in the song, but I just am implying that he's cool, but he's the leader.

Oh, okay.

And then Donatello does machines.

Okay.

So he's not cool.

So this is like the sort of letting him down easily.

Yeah, he's sort of the geeky, not cool one, but in the cartoon he does machines.

There's not a lot of that in the movie, but that's sort of his personality in the cartoon.

What machines does he do in the cartoon, meaning he like drives this ambony as well as freestandboning?

I believe in the cartoon intro, the animation is him sitting at like this giant supercomputer that is maybe 3D printing a pizza or something.

Maybe it's a manhole.

Okay, it's got maybe it's a manhole.

But so those are the personalities from the cartoon.

But in the movies, they really just have Leonardo as the leader, Michelangelo parties, Donatello's Corey Feldman, and Raphael is a bad boy.

Okay, so who does the surfer voice?

That would be Michelangelo.

And who does that one?

That's Corey Feldman or no?

That's not Corey Feldman.

Corey Feldman's Donatello does machines.

The voice of Michelangelo.

So here's an interesting thing about Michelangelo, Scott.

Okay.

Do you remember?

Let me look up the name.

Do you remember cousin Oliver Scott?

Sure from the Brady Bunch.

She was added in a later season, and it's a lot of people think that's when the Brady Bunch jumped the shark.

Guess who grew up to be the voice of Michelangelo, Scott?

Whoa, no way.

That's right, Scott.

It's him.

It's the guy who played, what's his name?

Robert Rist, I believe.

Oh, Robbie Rist.

Yeah, Robbie Rist.

Yes.

Didn't he have a band too, like a pop band as well?

Oh, great question.

You know that?

You might want to bring that up on your band.

Feel like in the mid-90s, when I was seeing a lot of John Brian-y, poptopia type stuff that Robbie Rist was a player in that scene, but I have no idea.

Interesting.

I'll look into it, Scott.

Maybe play a couple songs and do an album listening.

Okay, great.

But he was Michelangelo, and he's also the dominus guy.

And there's like a New York guy, right?

The New York guy is Raphael, and that is the guy that was in the text.

That's in the text again.

Okay, great.

And then if you had to describe Corey Feldman's voice, what is he doing?

What kind of voices he doing?

Oh, it's hard to say, but it's like a vocal fry.

It's like I can't describe his vocal fry.

Hey, what's going on?

There's a bit of that.

Yes, yes.

And look, Donatello is just as funny as Michelangelo in this.

I don't think they could just sideline him with just machines in the movie.

I think they've kind of been boring.

Sure, sure.

I had a hard time distinguishing all of the turtles myself.

That's why they gave him colors.

Maybe you need to see if you're colored.

Okay, it's good.

But in Act 1, Raphael's piece, he's like sort of separating himself from the turtles because yeah, you know, splinter's gone, and he's sort of their dad.

And after a heart to heart with Raphael, Raphael's feeling really, really vulnerable.

So he goes up onto a roof and starts kicking and fighting, which was like a funny scene.

You buy himself.

Buy himself.

You just start kicking and fighting.

And I think it's sort of like, what's that movie where the guy goes into the woods and just starts like kicking around?

And what is it called?

It's like, I'm trying to get any movie where anyone goes into the woods.

Is it?

This is another one I have not seen.

Scott, this is, I can't, we should just call this movie.

Scott hasn't seen.

But anyways, Raphael is injured in a fight with the foot.

And the foot is the, are the ninjas.

Yes.

Who are, who additionally have bad Asian accents.

Yes, of course.

And they are led by Shredder, who's this sort of like, he runs this sort of like lost boys, like runaway boys home for bad kids.

He has sort of a bane mask on and he as well has pictures of bane on his cloak.

He definitely has bane all over his cloak.

It's like a 70s costume.

But yeah, he's wearing a mask that obscures his face.

Yes, but there's something about these turtles and the way that they've, they've described their fighting that reminds him of something.

Reminds him of something.

I will say he's the antagonist and he does not show up for a long ass test.

That's right.

So that's what I kind of mean by dramatically inert a little bit.

Mm.

So if you were rewriting this, you'd say what Shredder in the first, first scene?

What?

No.

Well, no, no, no.

I mean, you basically like, you want to make it, uh, one sixth of the way through the movie you want to establish your antagonist, probably.

So maybe it's they, they, they're fighting this guy.

They're fighting a guy from the foot and they're like, tell us what you know.

And he's like, I can't, I can't shredder will kill me.

And everyone's like, who's Shredder?

Who's Shredder?

And then Shredder's right behind him going, Shoo-doom.

I'm the guy who just killed it.

Okay, we're going to have to save that true truth for later because that's the way he sort of pops into Act 3.

But Act, Act 1 is in, in, uh, New York, Raphael gets injured and they have to retreat to a cabin.

Scott, and we got to talk about a life.

Cateus too.

We got to talk about Elias Casey Jones, Scott.

So tell me what you know about Elias Scott.

Okay, so I, I, I had heard of April O'Neill.

Okay. And that, that she was a friend of the turtles.

I didn't know anything about her being a reporter or anything like that.

I've never heard of Casey Jones.

I don't know whether he is part of the cartoon.

Don't know whether, but Elias Cateus pops up in the movie and one of the turtles, I'm assuming Raphael, I don't know.

It's Raphael.

He's the, he's cool, but rude.

He's cool, but rude.

But he subdues, in a cool, but rude way, uh, three pickpockets.

And then Elias Cateus wearing hockey gear, I think, bursts out of the, uh, burst out and then is going to kill them with his hockey stick.

Yes, go.

And then Raphael says, hey, don't kill them.

And then they fight and their, and their enemies from, from what I could tell.

Yes.

Now Scott, that is pulled directly from the comic books.

It is.

I think even line for line is from like, where they're like, all right, pal.

And the whole like, uh, Jose Conseco bat thing.

Oh, by the way, what is this?

There are several jokes I do not understand.

Sand.

Yeah, same.

I believe this is one of the first ones.

He says, uh, he says that he says something about a, hey, is that a Jose Conseco bat?

Tell me you didn't pay money for this.

Yeah.

I don't.

Is that a slam on Jose Conseco?

Now I, I feel like he was a meta something at the time.

So it's an interesting slam.

I don't, I'm going to look that up, Scott, because that to me puzzled me too.

There were a lot of jokes.

I'm just like, I don't know what this is from.

It's from like a 1930s movie.

I think he did.

I think Michelangelo does an impression of Cagney or something.

Oh, no, at a certain point they start doing impressions.

One, one of them does the worst alone I've ever seen.

April O'Neill is cackling.

She's cracking up like it's a good impression.

And then the next person says, starts doing a Cagney impression.

And then April O'Neill says, Shredder must love that.

And then, and then they all go splinter, sorry, sorry, splinter must love that.

And then everyone gets silent and she goes, what?

It was a joke.

And then they all laugh like, ha, ha, ha, no, we got it.

We were just fucking with you.

Scott, what does it mean?

Scott, the line is you dirty rat.

Ah, you know, Scott, this is why we're going to have to do a rewatch.

So we're going to do a season one of this part.

And then the rewatch season where you're sort of a fan.

And you're like, and you're sort of like getting like Easter eggs and stuff.

But can we can we talk about two, a few other jokes?

I just don't get just, please, you can explain them to me.

This is a segment of the pod called jokes.

I don't get.

Can you explain them?

So at a certain point, they're underneath in the sewers.

And they say, are we where we're supposed to be?

And someone says, do you mean like 13th and Broadway?

And someone sniffs and goes, no, we're only on 9th Street.

Get it?

And then April O'Neill says, yuck.

So I guess what is happening?

I think maybe at the time the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in New York was sort of a slum, you know, it's the same place that Daredevil is from Hell's Kitchen.

And I think it might be a reference to that.

So it's a very specific New York street slam.

It's a specific New York street slam that might be an Easter egg for Daredevil.

Got it.

Okay.

Is it a good joke, Scott?

I don't think so.

And I think you're finding you're the one who's going to be writing the new stuff.

So like figure out what works and what does it, you know?

Okay, I guess.

There is a certain point where someone says, time to switch to decaf April, which doesn't make sense in that particular situation.

But it is a joke that is like, commonly you'll find it in movies where people go, time to switch to decaf.

Yes.

I think what I think it is, is I think she had just been flustered by something because her boss was in the house and the turtles had to hide while her boss was walking around her apartment.

Right.

So as she's flustered and closed the door, she's like, oh, and Michael, I was like, you better switch to decaf.

I don't think it's a good joke.

Either Scott, you know, it's a big reach to me, but I'm writing these down.

There is a certain point where one of the turtles decides to spin on his back.

And he says, California roll.

I guess I'm guessing because he's the one with the sort of surfer accent.

I think yes.

I don't, the California roll of it all doesn't make any sense.

Like he could have said like rainbow roll or sort of anything.

Like, you know, is there like an orange roll and Michelangelo roll?

I don't know.

It's just not a good jokes, Scott.

Yeah.

But if you, but if you follow the movie, Scott, they realize their jokes aren't great.

And towards the end, they're pitching jokes to each other.

Yeah.

But they're, and each one is worse.

And then finally on the third one, someone goes brilliant or excellent.

So yeah, the jokes aren't great, Scott, but this movie is about the grit, the gore, the, the, now the heart of the movies act too, Scott, but before we get into it, I think we go to take a break.

We got to take a break.

Yes.

We should take a break.

Um, we'll be right back with more, more doe boys.

Oh, no, no, we'll be right back with more seep- no, we'll be.

All right, we'll be right back with whatever this podcast is.

All right.

And we are back and we were just about to jump into act two, which to me is the heart of the movie, the cabin scene, Scott.

Is this truly act two?

This is a very poorly structured movie.

I think, yes.

Elias Kotayus, who's, by the way, a good actor.

And I, I really liked him in some kind of wonderful, which is maybe how he got this gig because he was so charismatic and magnetic in that that he's playing sort of the comedy character in this.

Yeah.

And this movie was considered an indie film at the time, so it might have been- Sure.

And by the way, he was speaking of New Line.

He was married, I believe at the time to Jennifer Rubin, who was in Nightmarron Elm Street.

Three dream warriors.

Maybe that's how the whole connection is the new line family.

Yeah.

So he helps the turtles out and then they have to go to this cabin, which he looks at the cabin and says, like, hey, didn't they use this in the grapes of wrath?

And then April says, very funny.

Yeah.

Isn't it really?

I don't- Yeah, I don't think it's funny either.

I will say a lot of the jokes, you can sort of be like, it was like a lot of this, like, saved by the bell and those kind of shows at the time.

It's like, you know all these jokes were written by old men that were just like, I'm referencing 1930s movies.

I think Stallone impressions are funny.

Yes.

We did a sketch on Bang Bang that Dan Klein wrote.

That was sort of based on this, which was- we were noticing that- You know how when you watch a show and you can just tell who's in the writer's room?

Yes.

So like, I was watching RuPaul's recent Netflix sitcom, and every character talks like a drag queen, even if they're not a drag queen.

But we did a sketch about a sort of like teen soap opera that was written by super old Jewish writers, and they all talk about Jewish- that's what this reminds me of is they're all like, they're all jokes from other movies.

Yeah.

They're just references, you know, where people go like, hey, this is kind of like moonlighting, isn't it, when Eliza Coteis and April O'Neill are fighting?

Yeah.

Yeah, there's a lot of like half references.

I don't think they knew how to do that kind of thing back in the 90s, you know?

They were just like shooting- Yeah.

Like there's a TV show I used to watch called Out of This World, Scott.

I don't know if you've ever heard of it, but it's- I've heard of it.

I've never saw it.

It's got a great theme song, and it's about a young girl who finds out that her father is an alien.

She never met a father.

She finds out she's half alien, and she gets powers every year.

And it's this sort of teen sort- Every day she continually has powers?

Every year on her birthday, she gets a new power.

So she gets an additional power?

Yes.

She gets an additional power.

She doesn't only has powers on her birthday.

She gets them, and she can have them forever.

Okay, so every year she gets a new power, she has this stopping time like Zack Morris.

Oh, okay.

So, but anyways, the reason I bring this up is because it's this like coming of age story about this girl that goes from like 15 to 18 in the four seasons, but it's so clearly- She lives in the four seasons?

She lives in the four seasons, yeah.

And it's so clear that it's written by old men. Like the jokes this little girl is saying.

It's like- They're all references to like, you know, like- I mean, I was going to say stuff like references to Gilligan's Island or whatever, which there are references to in this movie.

But like when the grapes of wrath came up, I was like, okay, what 80-year-old guy is writing this?

Well, Cagney, isn't that like a 19-K-A-T movie?

Yeah, exactly.

It's insane.

So anyways, this is the heart of the movie. It's got the cabin.

The cabin.

I will say one reference they make is they say, this guy's like Wayne Gretzky on steroids.

And I thought it would be funny in our movie.

If we made references where it was like, this guy's like Mark McQuire on steroids.

And then someone goes, do you just mean Mark McQuire?

Yeah.

Oh, Scott!

This guy's like Lance Armstrong on steroids.

Now Scott- You mean like Lance Armstrong.

Let me ask you this Scott.

Now that you know the characters, who you think would be the one delivering that punch?

I don't know the characters.

I've watched this movie.

I don't know the character.

Jesus, Scott.

I think it's a Michelangelo joke, but we'll get it.

Okay, we'll figure that out.

So in the cabin, Scott, they think Splinter's dead.

Raphael is in a coma, in a tub.

And the movie becomes very internalized.

It broke Neil Sprinkle's water on him once and goes- She'll be okay.

This walks away.

She like, Sprinkle's water on him like he's free willy or something.

Like he got to keep a wet fan to breathe.

But I'll be honest, Scott, all jokes aside.

Every single time we get to the cabin and I watch this movie, I am so drawn into this part of the movie.

I think the cinematography is absolutely amazing.

I will say this is the most aha the movie is because April O'Neill, who is by the way, a news reporter, a hard hitting news reporter, who apparently works on one story every day.

And then they repeat her story at five and at six o'clock, which I didn't know news program.

That's how it works, Scott.

Just repeated things back in the 90s.

Sure.

But in any case, she's a reporter.

She takes up sketching in the middle of the movie.

This part- She sketches the turtles and then it segues from her sketches to them literally in those poses.

And I was like, this is a lot like take on me.

So it makes sense.

Exactly, Scott.

This was the take on me element.

She's drawing the turtles and she's sort of saying stuff like, with Raphael down, the other turtles are coping.

Donatello is making jokes with Casey Jones.

And then there's like a really bad scene where they're just like in a truck making jokes, going by the alphabet insulting each other, which I thought was a fine premise.

But like, come on, hose brain or the shit they say is stupid.

Yeah.

And at one point someone says, hey, how's the work on the truck going?

And Elias Coteis goes, does that answer your question?

Yeah, it's so it's so it doesn't.

I mean, I guess I could assume it's going explosion?

I don't know.

I think he was trying to shoot it to put it out of its misery.

Maybe.

And he's saying, does this answer your question?

I'm like, it just makes it a little more confusing.

I don't think he shoots anything.

I think he's a hockey stick guy.

If you remember in the end of the movie, he has to have a stick that is associated with a sport in order to beat anyone.

So he's a stick guy.

He's not a hockey stick guy.

He gets a golf club and he's like, hey, this is in my wheelhouse, baby.

He's finally like, thank God, there's a golf club here.

But the scene, okay, so we're in the cabin and the turtles are all there.

Raphael wakes up and the scene where he wakes up and like, Lea Dotto's like, he's awake, he's awake.

I truly am like, all right, I'm already welling sort of.

I'm stabbing the guy.

Well, the other thing we should mention is Elias Coteis, Casey Jones.

Sorry.

And April O'Neill have a real will there, won't they?

Although it's just unpleasant kind of.

I'm going to say I'm going to make it a won't they?

I don't like that any of that part.

I don't like their relationship.

But at one point, he, yeah, I got it.

At one point, she walks in and she's like, got a kink in her neck.

And she's like, oh, and he forcibly sits her down against her wishes.

Scott, I hate that.

And then he starts to massage her and he immediately goes down to her boobs.

Watching you watch it, Scott.

I was like, I feel bad.

I'm subjecting my friend to this.

I feel bad if my boner was getting in the way of your view.

I will say that that is a problem.

We're going to have to talk about it.

But Scott, I will, to be honest, they should do a special edition where you just cut that scene up.

There's no reason for it.

And then Michelangelo comes in and gets turtle wax.

The whole thing is for a turtle wax joke.

As a joke, yeah.

What I was wondering is, does he actually put the turtle wax on?

This is a great part of, we need to figure out, I think for our movie, we have an Easter egg where there's an empty turtle wax can in the bathroom.

We're like, I guess he did use the turtle wax.

I guess he did use it.

Maybe he's using it to jerk off.

I don't know exactly what's going on with this wax.

But now we get to our scene that sort of thrusts us into the third act, Scott.

They think Splinter's dead.

And early in the movie, Splinter says, in order to master being a ninja, you have to master the body and the mind, Scott.

Right.

So Leonardo's meditating, which I guess is something the turtles do.

Not really established any other time.

Yeah, yeah.

But he's doing the ohm kind of with his fingers.

He's sort of meditating and he sees a glimpse of Splinter, who's still alive and captured by Shreda.

Right.

And he goes to the other three and he says, Splinter's alive.

I don't believe I know.

By the way, I'm just putting together Splinter is called Splinter because Daredevil's master is called Stick.

That's right.

And that's a funny thing to be like a splinter off a stick.

Is that right?

Yes, Scott.

The whole thing is a parody, like you said.

Like the ooze that made Daredevil blind is the same.

Ooze that made the turtle.

I did not realize that either.

Did you not put that together, Scott?

Okay.

I think there is even a comic where you see that the ooze get to Daredevil.

His eyes go whatever and then the ooze rolls into the sewer.

Oh.

And then you see the start of the turtle.

I've seen that.

I think that might be the first comic, Scott.

Oh, okay.

So there's so much Daredevil, she's a near Scott.

It's hard to even that's what I asked on saying.

I think that ninth street thing is a Daredevil reference.

Okay.

Got it.

So anyways, Leonardo thinks that Shreda's alive.

And this Scott, to me, this is the part of the movie that is a sort of non-starter.

Like we have to have this part in the reboot.

We have to have the meditation where they see Splinter and they all start crying.

They all see it inexplicably.

They are weeping.

Not tears of joy either.

No, they think because Splinter, he sort of operates to them in sort of a force ghost style.

And at the end of it, he says- Force ghost?

Yeah.

He's a force gump or- No, I was saying- He's a ghost in a forest.

I'm saying- Sorry, Scott.

I'm saying force ghost like Star Wars.

Oh, okay.

Because Forest Ghost.

Well, they're in the forest in the scene, so it is a forest ghost.

No, but this is a good idea for a different movie.

All right.

Let me write it down.

Because Forest Gump would be dead by now, wouldn't he?

I mean, he's lived through so much history, but Tom Hanks is alive.

Let's get him as a ghost.

Forest Ghost.

Wait, you know Haley Joel, right?

Yeah, of course.

Yeah, get him in there.

He'll see he's the only person who can see him.

We'll get Haley Joel in the- Oh, he's just a 6-3 boot.

Scott, you're on fire.

We've got to sort of take this beam of energy, focus it back on the turtles here.

Yeah, okay, sure.

And just make sure that there's a way in the new movie that we get a scene where the turtles are like meditating together, some dead, and then they start crying.

Because his last words- I'm not a mixture that's in there.

His last words to them are my final words to you, and I don't know why he says that, because no one's threatening to kill him.

Maybe he just meant the final words of this communique.

I think there's a weird miscommunication that causes them to all cry and sort of forces them into act 3.

I think that maybe he's dead, or maybe I don't know.

So they basically meditate.

They do a speech that I used to have memorized for real, and it is truly one of the- It's a heartbreaking scene where these four sons think their father is dead.

The whole movie is about Father Scott.

Yeah.

Shredder- I mean, Shredder is a surrogate father for these runaways.

The character- the side character, Danny, runs away from his father and is reunited at the end of the movie.

So it's all about Father Scott.

So write the dad.

What's we, you know, Father's Day?

Yeah.

Sort of just passed.

So we've got to- maybe we dropped this on Father's Day.

Next year?

I don't think we can wait that long for it.

Okay.

Well, yeah, you're right.

This thing's going to come out now.

So- Oh no, I'm talking about the movie we make.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, maybe we call it Father's Day, and it's like an extension of the Father's Day universe with Robin Williams and John Travolta.

That's amazing.

We're going to talk about Robin Williams in a second to him.

Oh, we are?

We are, Scott.

He's going to connect you to the movie.

So- Oh, wow.

So they see Shredder.

They think he's dead.

And then they- My favorite scene of the movie is when Casey Jones and like April O'Neill is sitting on that bench and they get interrupted by the turtles and they cut to the turtles.

It's a fucking morning rise shot.

Yeah.

Which by the way, he's talking to April and all they do is clear their throat.

They go, Ahem.

And he turns and says, Guys, I told you.

I hate when you do that, all right?

I guess they're trying to say like because they move so swiftly, you never hear when they're coming, but- But they clear their throat to alert him.

I know.

It's not a well executed joke.

I'm going to write that down.

The clearing throat thing.

Okay.

Maybe it just doesn't like people clearing their throats.

Maybe that's it.

Yeah.

So anyways, Leonardo says the iconic phrase, It's time to go back, which we've got to write it down because we've got to go back in time.

It's time to go back.

We've got to go back.

It's like lost.

Exactly.

We've got to go back.

I think that's a direct reference from Jack in season three, where he says to Kate, We have to go back, Kate.

He's referencing Turkey.

He's referencing.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

So this is before the scene where they say to Elias Coteas, Hey, you're claustrophobic.

And he says in response, I never looked at another guy before.

Okay.

They're right.

That's coming up.

They go back to New York and they take up to their sewer house.

And he says he's claustrophobic.

And they make an incredibly off-college joke.

Homophobic as hell.

And look, it was- But it doesn't even make sense because if he thinks they're saying you're homophobic and he responds, Hey, I've never even looked at another guy before.

It doesn't even make sense.

It's again, Scott.

They weren't good at writing jokes.

You know, and I think that's why you're brought in on this project.

Okay.

I will say the bearing, the pizza was funny.

I laughed at that.

That scene, when I saw it, when I watched it, I was like, I actually think Scott's going to laugh at that part.

Okay.

Because I'll be honest, as a kid, I don't think I understood the penicillin thing.

I was like, what the hell is a penic- So is that a topping on pizza?

It's not that part of it isn't all that well executed.

But when they bury the pizza because it's too old to eat, I thought that and they do a da-da-da-da, they have like a funeral for it, I thought that was funny.

So we're going to be doing some Easter eggs on that with April O'Neill's funeral.

In the- In our movie- Oh, oh, that's it.

In our movie with April O'Neill's funeral, that's how it starts.

You got to write this stuff.

This is why I always write stuff down.

So they put penicillin on her.

They- Instead of sprinkling dirt on the casket, it's a little bit of penicillin.

Wow.

So we're in Act 3, we've back to New York, and what happens as soon as they get back to New York is they're attacked by the foot, and then they fight till the end of the movie.

That's basically- The foot, by the way, now I'm realizing is a parody of The Hand, which is- Yes.

Which are the ninjas in Daredevil.

Okay.

That's right, Scott.

He's catching up.

Look, Scott, you're going to be a freaking master of the turtles by the end of this.

Okay, okay, great.

So we get- So they finally- It's revealed that Shredder is this- They have a flashback to Splinter's- How he came to New York.

You find out that Shredder is the guy that Splinter scarred- Yes.

With his claws back in- Shredder killed Splinter's master.

Right.

And- All stuff that should have been pushed earlier, but I'm happy to have it here, because it did make for a ripping finale.

It's a late flashback where you're like, Oh, shit, this is personal, you know?

Yeah.

And what happens is Casey Jones, and this will look at Danny, rescue Splinter.

Yeah.

And while O'Neill, by the way, not part of it- No.

I guess it's not woman's work or something, but I do have to say, at least she wasn't made a hostage the whole time.

No, she wasn't a hostage.

There's a scene where she's like in a crawl space above them, and they're fighting, and she knocks someone with like a- With like a broomstick.

I forgot.

Yeah, that's the one thing she gets to do.

And then Michelangelo's like, Good job, April or something.

It's pretty cool.

That felt like a reshoot to me of like, Oh man, April just- Yeah.

Out and out disappears from this movie.

We gotta put some- I think that's where I sing her in the first act, and we're going with a daughter who's been training with the turtles their whole life.

Oh wow.

So we don't have to deal with that in our movie.

But- So anyways, this third act is a sort of flurry of action where they're just fighting the foot, trying to find Splinter, because they know that the shredder has Splinter at a certain point.

So they're on the roof.

They're on a roof.

This is the final scene of the movie.

They're on a roof, and they're fighting the foot, and they beat them all up.

And then who drops down from the ceiling with a- Chuchunk.

Shredder.

That's right.

He's there.

He's got a battleum.

And they all take turns for some reason, because- What do you think of this fight scene, Scott?

Because this is where you get to see the most sort of suit combat.

Yeah, there's not a lot of combat in the movie.

There's approximately 15 seconds here and there.

Yeah.

A couple of those punches where you just sort of like put your fist up behind you, and you like, knock someone over you.

Right.

Yeah, there's not a lot.

So it was good to see a little more combat in this.

But I wish they weren't doing that stupid thing of like, let's take him on one at a time.

Like all four attack, which, you know, by the way, speaking of Jackie Chan, I was watching a documentary about him, and he talks about how he hated that in movies, and how he always wanted in his movies everyone to attack at the same time.

Oh, it made his movies so incredible.

Like, rumble in the Bronx.

He's like fighting like seven people in one so that like refrigerate a scene, and it's like, that's what makes those movies great.

But for turtles, we go one at a time.

Sure.

And we shoot for it to see who's going next, if we don't want to, you know.

Yes.

But this scene is like, I think for kids would be kind of scary, because Shred is like, ready to kill them quite honestly.

Yeah, he's going to kill them.

He doesn't have a great plan, because when finally, splinter is hanging onto him, and he's hanging on for dear life before he falls to his death, he decides to take out a weapon and tries to kill splinter at that point, which is like, you're going to get dropped.

Either way, you slice it, let him pull you up and then kill him.

It's a really stupid, like Shred is kind of gets really stupid at the end, but again, once he realizes it's personally starts listening.

This time it's personal, yeah.

And then I have to say, he finally drops down, and I think he's not dead, and Elias Coteas kills him by mashing him up in a garbage trap.

Oh, this was a controversial point of the movie.

Shred is falls from the top of this thing.

Splinter has now defeated Shred.

Which would be fine if he fell to his death, because it was his fault.

He tried to attack Shred.

He was trying to, but instead, they give Casey Jones this sort of moment where he looks away from camera and says, oops, turns on the trash compactor and crushes splinter to death.

Oh, Shred.

And it's truly shocking.

You're a super fan of this movie and you can't keep splinter and shredder.

It's hard.

They both end in like her and it's hard, but he kills Shred in a way that to me was like, as a kid, I always thought, okay, oops, he crushed him.

I never really thought about it, but then as an adult, I was like, wait, what just happened?

This guy is committed to murder here.

Yeah.

And then all the cops show up.

It's like, April, you've got to report that this guy committed to murder.

Yeah.

It's bizarre because so many movies bend over backward to make the hero blameless in a villain's death of like, oh, well, you know, he was gonna save his life, but at the last second, the villain tried to shoot him and all that kind of stuff.

And this one just like straight up has a lies cotius crushing a man today.

And they did the work to get everyone off the hook.

Yeah.

They're like, say nuts.

It's nuts, but you know what?

That's what makes this movie gold, Scott. It's dark as hell.

Shred is dead.

It's dead as hell.

Shredder is dead.

That's what I said.

I love it right that time.

Shredder is dead. That's what I said.

Yeah. Let's get Curtis Mayfield in on this.

So that's sort of the end of the movie, Scott.

You get a weird piece.

You do have a sense.

Yeah, terrible kiss.

You have Sam Rockwell.

This is the only time I clocked that it actually was Sam Rockwell.

Was when he has the one line.

I forget exactly what it is.

I'll tell you what it is.

He has a few lines in the movie.

First one is bad timing.

And that's when they rub April O'Neill in first.

OK. I didn't know that was him at that point.

That was him.

Then the second one is when they're walking through the like, sort of like, like little, like, runaway home for these boys.

There's like video games and shit.

They could do whatever they want.

Which is why, by the way, I thought most kids like the movie was the fantasy element of like all these Oliver Twist style pick buckets hanging out together playing video games.

It's a huge part of it.

Scott, we have a touch on it.

They have a big part like that and double drag in the movie as well.

I think it was a trope at the time.

It was just like, we own this way house.

It's for kids, you know.

It's like Burger King Kids Club.

Sure, of course.

Burger King, by the way, represented in the movie.

Yes, definite first.

What a product placement.

The Burger King comes out before Domino's even in the movie.

It's very interesting.

Yeah.

Um, but anyways, the second line, he says, um, he's like, you could do whatever you want here.

Some shit like that.

And then somebody's like, do you have cigarettes?

And he goes, you want regular?

A menthol.

That was him saying that.

That was him.

And it's a weird part because it's like, because what kid smokes menthol?

Yeah, why are we bringing up cigarettes at all?

And then menthol, what are you talking about?

That's an old people thing.

And then the final line is when the, this is an Easter egg Scott.

Final line, the police chief is saying, what happened here?

We want some answers.

And then he says, you'll get some answers.

Or no, he doesn't say that.

He says, why don't you check out the Eastman warehouse on Laird Island?

You'll get your answers there.

Aw.

A little, uh, Eastman.

That's for the comic book creators.

For the writers, right.

Kevin Eastman and Peter.

Wait, what answers are they're supposed to go to some island?

No, he's like, you missed this.

So the, the warehouse is like on an island.

I think it's like supposed to be like, Staten Island or something.

Oh, okay.

They do, you do see Elias Catea as like, kind of when the one kid goes back, leaves the turtles to go back to the, to rescue splinter.

You do see, yeah, it's on here.

Yeah, it's like, it's like on an island.

So he's the guys like, what happened here?

Cause the police chief didn't know anything about the foot or shredder.

And he says, if you want your answers, go to Eastman warehouse on Laird Island.

And my whole life, I was like, I don't know what the fuck he's saying there.

Those places don't exist.

And it wasn't until just today, when I walked home.

When you figured it out.

Where I was like, oh shit, that's a sick little Easter egg.

Sound real cool.

That's an Easter egg.

Well, two lines that I couldn't figure out.

And I had to, to go back, you saw me go back trying to figure out what they were.

Was at one point, Elias Cateus appears to say, I'll never call a golf, a doll, a game again.

Okay.

Here's what he says.

So this is the scene, the golf club scene.

Yeah.

Where he gets knocked, he's getting beat up by shredder's assistant and man.

And he's what he says, I saw the subtitle is, I'll never call golf a dull game again.

But instead he pronounces it, I'll never call a golf, a dollar game again.

Look, by the time they're at this part of the movie, they're not like doing multiple takes.

They're just like, we've, we've, we've, we're burning through daylight.

We spent months in these hodas suits.

And now that we've got like known turtles in these scenes, we just got to get through them.

We just got to get through them.

The other one that I couldn't figure out is when they kiss, when April O'Neill and Casey Jones kiss, one of the turtles said something and I had to rewind it three times.

And I guess it's important because it's referenced in one of the closing songs, but he says, 9.95, which I guess is an Olympic scoring joke on how good their kiss is.

Nice.

And then there, then it's a big part of one of these closing rap songs.

Yes, the closing rap song really does a good job of like explaining the movie.

Like, honestly, you could have probably just listened to the song.

Yeah. Well, which song, the one by Spunkadelic?

The one by Partners in Crime with a KRYME.

Yeah. What was his, the Humpty Dance or whatever? Is that his song?

Something like that.

Is it the Humpty Hump?

Spunkadelic was one, which I thought was a little inappropriate for a kid's movie.

Look, this movie's rude, too, and has his crude as well.

That's true. Yeah. It's his rude as Raphael is cool.

And rude.

Scott, I wanted to just tell you a couple of facts about the movie, just because I don't think you understand what went into it.

April O'Neill, Judith Hogue, had no idea what Ninja Turtles won.

Was Ninja Turtles yet no idea what it was when they hired her.

Okay.

She'd know she was in my position.

Yes, she was in your position.

You want to know who was the sprig to her?

Okay. Sure.

Robin Williams, Scott.

What?

They were on the set of a movie.

They did a movie together.

I got to look at what it is.

And it's pretty much canon that Robin Williams gave her all his team and Ninja Turtles comics and talked her through the entire franchise.

What?

Okay. If this has to be around 1988 or so.

Yeah.

Which is when Good Morning Vietnam came out, but makes you.

No, it's like a comedy.

Isn't that crazy?

Like Jack or something like a Jack.

It wasn't Jack.

Could you imagine Robin Williams explaining this movie to you?

I would love that.

I mean, that's really interesting.

I can imagine it because.

He's such a comic book fan.

So he was like, oh, you've got to do this movie.

The Ninja Turtles are this and April O'Neill's the coolest character.

So, you know, look, if you want to knock the movie, Scott, people like Jim Henson, Robin Williams, the odd guy.

Robin Williams doesn't necessarily like the movie.

I would love to see the follow-up conversation with him where he's like, oh, I saw that movie, boy.

Where he's like this movie.

Oh, oh, oh, he does the like the meter.

And it's like not going into.

Oh, it's on a nine point nine five.

So, oh, there's more like a three.

Mindy, Mindy.

One of the fact I want to tell you about this, but when it was released in my country in Britain, I guess I'm British or something.

I don't know.

Sure. Yeah.

I think you are.

I think I was from Tampa, but we'll change it to canon.

I'm British now.

Okay.

Um, now when it came out there, they didn't include Ninja in the title, Scott.

It was called Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.

Oh, I wonder because Ninjas weren't as popular.

I'll tell you, I think it was some racist shit.

I think they were like afraid.

It was like, it was a- That white people wouldn't go see it.

Oh, for sure.

It was a fair thing.

And they also took out the scene where Michelangelo uses the Nunchucks, you know, when they have the little Nunchuck off.

Yeah, they took that out.

They took it out because apparently they're afraid of Nunchucks.

Oh, there was like a weird Nunchuck ban or something at the time.

Oh man, England always banning our weapons that we should be constitutionally allowed to use.

I think you see way a guy.

I don't know.

Is that canon?

Yeah, that's all two A guys.

What are we in the like, what's the party that they- I'm double A thinking triple X.

Scott, I'm writing that down.

I don't know where we're going to use it, but I'm right.

Let's get Peaches involved in this.

Let's do the Spunkadelic reboot.

Okay, Scott, so we've watched this movie.

We've sort of did a download on it, Scott.

Yeah.

And I think you understand the themes of fatherhood.

Oh, by the way, the one thing about the movie that suddenly it is literally the last line, I think.

Yes.

And I was like, oh, that's part of their thing.

Yes.

So I think the whole movie is the origin story for this line, by the way.

They're trying to come up with an exclamation, a positive exclamation, and a celebratory one that they can all say in order to celebrate their victory.

And I'll say this.

This is a joke that's set up from earlier, because you see them pitching jokes to each other, and sometimes they're like, that's the one, that's the right one.

Michelangelo gets one, Donatello gets one.

Now we're at the end, they're pitching for the celebratory moment, right, Scott?

Right.

And then splinter comes in, and splinter has always been sort of a hard case on them, you know, and been like, hey, you know, this is not the way of the ninjutsu.

And he comes in and he says, I'm not even going to do his ex.

And because I don't want to get canceled either, but he says, he says, I've always preferred, or I've always taken a shine to, I can't recall exactly what he says.

Cowabunga.

And they all go, yeah, Cowabunga.

And I went, oh, that's one of their things.

Yes.

And then the final line is, I made a funny.

Is it?

I think he says I made a funny after that, when they're all laughing.

And to me, that I was maybe laughing too hard, or perhaps even like just shocked with the revelation that we'd gone a whole movie without them saying Cowabunga.

Was that what I was watching?

As soon as they said Cowabunga, you stood up from the couch and started clapping, like you have full standing ovations.

So I think you might have talked over when they said I made a funny.

Was that from the cartoon, the Cowabunga thing?

I think the Cowabunga is from the cartoon.

Yes, not from the comics.

Right.

So again, another entry in my theory that this was made for people who knew the cartoon really well.

And who were going to be like, oh, yeah, awesome.

Which every comic book movie sort of has a little bit of that.

I do think it's a prototype, novel type movie.

Well, when you saw the original Batman or the 1989 Batman, rather, you know, it had a ton of these things where like the bat plane flies up right in front of the moon and it looks like the bat signal.

And I remember opening night at Universal City Walk when I saw it.

Everyone just like, whoa, like, you know, because it's like the bat signal, you know, and so like a lot of these movies have that kind of stuff.

Well, you got to think about it at the Times got 1990.

This was already the most popular cartoon series on television.

And then the toys were the most sold toys of 1990.

They sold like...

Which made these guys super rich.

Super rich, which is all before the movies.

So in a way, there was a lot of turtles in the air before this came out.

Sure.

And I look, I think they do a good job in this sort of shadowy, badly filmed scenes of doing backstory with like little turtles that say radical.

To me, you didn't Scott.

You tell me you didn't laugh when there was a little baby turtle going, radical, radical, radical.

I lost my damn mind when I said that.

Well, the first one goes pizza, pizza.

And I thought, I thought a little Caesar's product placement was happening.

Interesting.

Little Caesar's trying to get in there with some line pitches.

Yeah.

I don't like, we only say pizza once in us because unless little Caesar's gonna pay us, we're only gonna say once.

Yeah, exactly.

Well, definitely not what I expected.

I was sort of hoping that number two will be a little more professionally made.

And I don't know anything about number two at all.

I don't know about this Oprah thing when it came up.

It might have been to promote the first one.

It might have been to promote number two.

Well, maybe we should have looked at it up.

They all came out from like, all between 1990 and 1993.

So it all was happening at the same time.

I doubt the turtles would have gotten on Oprah without the first one being popular.

So I feel like it was two.

Especially because one was sort of like a little too gritty.

Playmates didn't even make toys for the first one because they thought it was too violent.

Right.

So for the next one, maybe we should try to watch that Oprah thing.

Yes, let's watch that Oprah thing.

And I'll say for the next one, a lot of people, this is their favorite one.

I won't give you any spoilers.

But it's everyone's favorite one.

It's a bit of a reaction to the first one.

And I don't know.

I love one.

But I know Scott, you might watch two and be like, okay, this was my turtle.

Okay.

Well, is there a certain person?

We don't have to say who it is, but who loves number two that we should invite to be along with us?

Well, we'll figure it out.

You know, I think there might be a person who's a sort of ninja turtle's aficionado that could walk you through why two was important.

Okay, great.

So do you know anything about two right now?

I don't know anything other than I know because you've said it, the title is apparently the secret of the ooze.

Secret of the ooze.

I don't know anything about it.

I don't know if April O'Neill or Casey Jones appear in it.

I don't know whether Corey Feldman continues his vocal role.

I don't know anything about it.

Now I'm going to ask you one question, Scott.

It's going to be a little vague, but maybe it jogs your memory.

Okay.

Do you know anything about the music from ninja turtles too?

I do not know.

Scott, we're in for a little bit of a treat.

Oh boy.

Well, there was an MC Hammer song in this.

And I was like, did he do the theme to this much like he did for Adam's family too?

No, it was the Humpty guy.

But Scott, and one other thing, the music of this movie, the scoring of this movie, again, I will say is so good.

I know you think it's some sloppy shit.

No, the scoring of the movie is amazing.

And when they drop their little stings and shit, that shit is awesome.

The score, they spent some money on the score, although it was the typical 80s thing of having a very militaristic score of like, which then adds a blues guitar on it going, boooooooow.

Anytime a cool character comes on.

Yeah, they did a lot of that.

Like, or when like Casey Jones hits Rafael and he's flying through the air, you're like, oh, man, it's a guitar riff to show how shitty something was.

Right.

But yeah, Scott, they're going to carry over a lot of that scoring into two.

Don't tell me anything.

I don't want to know anything.

You're going to love it, Scott.

I have a feeling once we watch two, we're going to be able to look at the script and say, hmm, all right.

So we have our bare bones.

How do we add the meat to this thing?

Okay.

All right.

Well, you know what?

I don't like eating bones.

I prefer eating meat.

So let's do it.

All right.

I'm excited.

I'm excited to.

I now know a little bit more about the turtles.

If you had to ask me what I know about the turtles now, they say Kawabunga.

They do like pizza.

They wear, they all have different color masks, which I guess is supposed to be a shortcut to their personality.

And they have the rat guy splinter is their master who, I can't remember if he's alive at the end.

I think he is.

He's alive.

He says, that's a funny.

I made a funny.

And the their guy Shredder is dead.

Shredder's dead.

And then all I know is you mentioned on an earlier show, something about crang.

So I know, I know that's a thing.

I'll say, Scott, we may not get into crang.

Oh, wait.

No, you know what?

Maybe we'll get into crang.

I don't think it's in this canon of the live action.

Oh, okay.

But we'll get to crang and just say, we'll get to crang at a certain point.

Okay.

Cool.

So I was going to say comedy crang crang could be another title.

Oh, comedy crang.

Let me write that down.

Okay.

Maybe it's comedy.

Maybe it's comedy crang crang.

We have to stop talking.

Dm and Tm and CBB.

All right.

Well, I hope people enjoyed this.

I those are the things I know about the turtles now, but I'm expecting next episode for my mind to be blown.

Scott, you're going to get your mind blown.

There's going to be some new characters.

You're going to be fully on board and maybe some returning characters.

Like the two of these.

Maybe you want to know?

Yeah, we don't know.

Okay.

They do come back.

Okay.

They do.

Spoiler.

All right.

Well, this has been so much.

This was so, so much fun.

I'm glad we're finally being able to talk to the turtles.

Scott, when I listen to Bang Bang next week, I don't want to hear any Ninja Turtles stuff.

Okay.

I'll try to stay away from it.

If you steer into it, just make sure like, okay.

I'll just shut it down.

I'll shut it down and say, hey, that's another show.

That's another thing.

Thank you, Scott.

That's all I want.

Okay.

All right, Scott.

Well, from Whisper Studios, I want to say to our audience, thanks for listening.

And we'll catch you next time on, we have to stop talking TmNT on CBB.

Kill power!

I'm going to go back to the next slide.
