♪♪♪ Uh-oh, here comes Trouble, shave my butt cheeks on the double. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Thank you to Nells for Smells for that catchphrase submission.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week's special holiday week Silver Bells.

What's that?

It's a Christmas song.

Silver Bells?

Not familiar.

Not familiar with Silver Bells.

Introducing the Lemon Drop Kid. Bob Hope? Do you know Bob Hope or the Lemon Drop Kid?

Bob Hope sounds familiar. Lemon Drop Kid. I know Lemon Drop is a candy.

Okay, well we used to have Bob Hope.

Sorry, Johnny Cash.

That's Lemon Heads.

We used to have Lemon Heads, Mike and Ix.

Hey, good playties. Now we got...

No, no, uh...

No play.

No lemon, no play, no good.

Right?

Yep.

Welcome to the show. My name is Scott Ocharvin.

Let me introduce the person who I've been talking to.

A special holiday edition of the show.

We have a great one. A lot of people passing through.

But none earlier than this gentleman, you just heard him speaking in fact.

I don't remember anything about him.

Please welcome back to the show Oby Ron Kenobi.

Hey, thanks for having me back, Scott.

Oh, what a weird introduction.

I know you have...

We've met a couple of times.

We have met a couple of times.

I don't know. I wouldn't be that guy, but we've met before.

Atlanta, Georgia, together, I believe.

Yeah.

Are we not?

And also here.

Where the big runoff election just occurred.

Okay.

And we were there and I don't recall anything about you other than you don't know anything.

Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

I think that's a bit reductive.

I'm not really big on pop culture.

Right. Popular culture.

Yeah.

Are you into unpopular culture?

Well, I'm being in a way like nature, which clearly is...

Not very popular these days with the way we're treating the earth.

Oh, so you're sort of an eco guy.

I mean, I care about it, but...

Are you doing anything about it?

No.

Recycling anything.

I recycle, I guess.

Like, what do you mean when you say, I guess?

I mean, I put...

When the regular trash gas is full, then I start putting stuff for the recycling.

Okay, that's not recycling.

And you're putting the wrong stuff.

It's full, though.

Yeah.

Okay.

That's a good point.

Tell us again about you.

Who are you?

I'm just a guy.

My name is Obi-Rod Kenobi.

I apparently this is a Star Wars thing, but I was named after my mother.

Right.

Who's your mother again?

Well, if I was named after, who do you think she was?

Ron.

Or Obi-Rod.

Obi-Rod.

Oh, okay.

Her name was Obi-Rod.

Obi-Rod.

Interesting.

Yeah.

And her name is Kenobi as well, or your...

No.

She's a traditional lady.

She took my father's name.

I see.

Okay.

Her main name is none of your business.

I use it for my bank.

Oh, you use it for your bank.

Yeah.

In what way?

What way do you think?

You go to the bank and you have it in a safety deposit box.

Okay, Ben.

Let me tell you something.

I like you, okay?

I don't know if that's true.

I do like you, and I want to be friends with you, because I think you're a cool guy.

I think you're a cool guy.

And I know that a lot of times the way...

Why would you think I'm a cool guy?

I mean, you got a podcast?

Okay.

I have something to break to you.

Everyone is a cool guy, then.

I don't have a podcast.

That's true.

Yeah, you're on mine.

That's true.

Would you like your own podcast?

What would I talk about though?

Rocks.

I guess so.

Yeah.

You want to talk about rocks?

There's so many different kinds of rocks, dude.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, never mind.

I was about to offer you a CBB present.

Look, because I love nature, I really do it, right?

Yeah.

In lieu of pop culture.

I just said stuff never appealed to me, but nature is like, all around it's fascinating.

There's so many different...

You want to know the different kinds of rocks, though?

Uh, sure.

I'll give you five, okay?

Okay, five different kinds.

Thousands.

Okay.

Big.

Little.

Gray.

Brown.

That's four.

Under the ground.

Really?

Yeah.

Everything's brown there.

When you get down there.

Well, that's...

I can't say it's fascinating, but I appreciate that you have the breadth of knowledge.

You don't have to.

You don't have to say it's fascinating.

You know what I mean?

I'm not trying to be like a cool, special dude.

I'm just me.

You're just you, you're a boring guy who likes...

Well, I mean, okay.

And what's your...

I'm trying to like you.

You're in the middle of the forest trying to what?

What?

You're trying to...

What's your side thing?

Oh, well, I want to...

I want to heal...

I'm doing a lot of pagan stuff because I want to heal the earth.

Right.

So yeah, I don't recycle the way you're supposed to, but I am trying to call on the dark forces of the earth to heal itself of human beings.

Right.

And when you say that, you mean Satan.

No, I mean like...

Aren't you a Satanist?

No, that's two other guys.

I'm talking about druidism.

I'm talking about leylines.

I'm talking about the power of the earth itself.

Gaia.

Sure.

Mother earth.

Yeah.

Hey, you're cool.

Okay.

I think that you do all the terms.

Mother nature.

Yeah.

You know what I mean?

Like...

When I was a kid, there was this butter commercial.

Oh yeah, I was just thinking about it.

What I said about the nature.

And so here in the commercial, this is what I got turned off to pop culture, I think.

And I was like, this is disrespectful.

There was like, so this lady was supposed to be mother nature, and then somebody made a margarine.

And she's like, oh, this is delicious butter.

And then somebody said, we fucking got you.

It's like...

It's margarine.

It was the original punked.

Yeah.

And she said it's not nice to fool mother nature, but then she did not call down the power of lightning.

Right.

She did not open up her and swallow these people.

Yeah.

Right.

We saw margarine to this day.

Yeah, it's unfortunate, isn't it?

Yeah, it sucks.

Have you ever even tasted margarine?

Oh, I've tasted it for experimental purposes.

For experimental purposes, I've tasted many foods.

Men...

Really?

Is there a food?

Name of food?

Oh boy, bugs.

Have you tried bugs?

Okay.

We're not a dog.

I'm not gonna name hot dogs.

Everyone's trying hot dogs.

We're not in the Bible, okay?

People eat bugs all over the world.

That's their fault.

So you have not tried many.

Bugs from nature.

You're challenging me to name a food.

And then you make fun of the first one.

Yeah, they must food.

We started with margarine.

You went to bugs.

What?

Okay.

What's in between margarine and bugs to you?

Can you figure it out?

What's in between them?

Yeah, I've tried it.

Tea, this is not hard.

All right, I have to know.

Well, but if you get to one that I haven't tried, this is like you're trying to stump me.

We don't have time on this show to do that.

Candy Cates.

Have you ever tried candy canes?

What do they look like?

It's like a hook.

You know, it's like a cane.

It's literally in the name.

Okay, first you go look.

Then you go cake.

They're not called candy hooks.

Or sandy hooks.

Oh, geez.

They're like a little cane that a cat would wear.

If it were, you know, had a broken leg.

A little cane that a cat would wear with an had a broken leg.

Yeah.

Okay, you're making it out like I have the problem.

All right, so you've never tried candy games.

We've hit on finally having.

I have seen them.

You've seen.

I didn't ask you if you see them.

Put that to another category.

I don't care about things you've seen.

Anyone can see things.

What if I've seen a UFO?

Okay, have you seen any UFO?

No, but what if I haven't?

Okay, well you haven't.

You've seen normal regular everyday things that no one gives a shit about.

Wow, man.

Wow.

I don't want to be your friend.

Well, you called me up and you begged me to do this show.

I did.

Because special holiday show.

Yeah, I did.

And I was like, I don't know.

I don't know what I was thinking.

I'm not into the holidays.

And you're like, you're not into the holidays.

No, you're not into the holidays.

Weird thing.

It's stupid.

What's stupid about it?

Baby Jesus, the rest?

Yeah.

I mean, the idea that, look, some babies are cute, right?

Sure.

But start a whole religion about them?

I know.

Well, it is strange.

That's weird.

It's like the Beach Boys in surfing.

It's like I have hobbies too.

Oh, my God.

But every song.

I've heard about these guys.

And I'm like, first of all, that name is ridiculous.

And so it's like, okay.

Beach Boys.

You don't live at the beach.

You happen to be at the beach occasionally.

So what is it like, because they love the beach so much?

I guess they, but I mean, if they really were to break down their time.

Why are they called the music boys?

I wouldn't trust them.

If they like the beach more than music, I'm not going to listen to music.

I go into the record store.

I see the Beach Boys.

I go, I mean, I'm interested in people playing music.

I don't have to listen to this.

Is there a band called the music boys?

There should be.

You wish to start it.

You would be.

I feel like our religion is about shaking crack.

Back on track.

The music boys.

Over on the note again, Scott Augurman.

Okay.

So music, what is a big part of music that I should know?

Uh, you probably should know the basics.

Uh, rock and roll Elvis Presley.

Chubby Checker, which is a play on Fat Stomino.

Uh, and uh, you know.

Chubby Checker, the guy that sang with the Fat Boys at one time.

Yes, so you know that.

I've heard of the Fat Boys.

Okay, you have.

That's a song that I heard the, the, the pharmacy one time.

The Twist or the Fat Boys?

Fat Boys.

Whatever.

What?

That's one of their songs.

That's their first single.

What?

So music is basically, you name yourself some kind of boy.

And then that's your whole thing.

And then you sing about that.

I love the beach.

I love being fat.

I'm a beach boy.

Look at me.

I'm a beach boy from noon to three.

Is that one?

What?

Yeah.

Is that one of their songs?

Oh, they're most popular songs.

They go to the beach for three hours and they call themselves the beach boys.

I know.

That's outrageous.

Just not add up.

I hate these guys on site.

I hate them.

I hope I've never seen them.

Yeah.

Um, well, uh, we're, we're, we're going to get into the studio at some point.

Uh, promise me that.

We are a studio.

Well, I mean the, the recording, music recordings.

Are they different?

They're different studios.

Yeah.

Do they decorate it according to what kind of boy you are?

Sure.

They can.

Yeah.

It's like with the Beach Boys record, there's like sand all over the place.

Yep.

It's, it's, it's like.

That actually is not too far off.

The high of the Brian Wilson had, had sand in the recording studio.

Was he one of the boys?

He was one of the boys.

Yeah.

He's one of the Beach Boys.

One of the, uh, biggest members of the Beach Boys.

They're ranked by size.

Yes.

Who's the smallest one?

Brian Wilson, number one with a bullet.

Michael Love, maybe.

That's all.

For.

No.

Whoa.

I think as a lover of science, I know that small.

And he has a big hat though.

He has a baseball hat.

Does that give him some, it gives him some, it's not to cover up that he's bald.

Certainly not.

It's to give him another foot and a half.

What?

What is it a specific baseball cap?

I don't remember.

Is he famous for it?

Uh, he's, well, no, I'd say it's more famous for being one of the Beach Boys.

Who's the most famous hat guy, Napoleon?

Who like hatters?

Lincoln.

Pacific hat.

Lincoln.

Number one.

Lincoln, okay.

I mean, no one else has ever been able to wear that hat.

Any, anyone does, they go, you're wearing a Lincoln hat.

You're saying, wait, you're saying some people wore the Napoleon hat?

And they're like, hey, that looks good on you.

Well, some people could wear the Napoleon hat and people go, oh, you're French.

But no one ever goes, you have the Napoleon hat.

You're saying that the Napoleon hat is more of a French thing than it is a Napoleon hat.

Like a French army thing.

Even though we call it the Napoleon hat.

Do we call it the Napoleon hat or are we just calling it the Napoleon hat?

Do you call it the French army hat?

Come on, dude.

I think there are smarter people than us who are calling it the French army.

I want to like you, dude.

I want to like you.

This is part of my problem with you.

Is we should not be at odds so much just from these minor transgressions.

But I mean, you're, you're me.

You're a mean guy.

I'm a mean guy?

You say mean thing.

Fuck off.

There we go.

How do I talk?

There we go.

How do I talk?

I don't want to talk to you, though.

Let's bring up our next.

I press, you're on or I'm going to bring our next.

Yes.

Well, speaking of nature.

That's from the law.

LA, those are reference to the law.

Um, speaking of nature, he's part of nature.

He's a dog, which is one of the animal kingdom.

And please welcome him back to the show, McGruff the Crime Dog.

Hello, Scott.

Hi.

How are you?

It's great to meet you.

I am part of nature.

Wait, you met me before.

I met you.

You smelled me.

I smelled you.

I shat in your backyard.

You what?

Well, you weren't there.

I said, could I use the restroom?

And then you kept doing the podcast with Anders Holm or something.

Oh, that's right.

And then I walked over to the corner and I said, ooh, I'm going to shake my leg a little bit.

Get into position.

Drop a sick little doggy turd right here.

On the side is called the doggy bathroom.

Oh, I did not know that really.

All about side.

When you guys say I'm going to go outside, I go, I'm going to go to the doggy bathroom.

What happened during caveman time?

Oh, be around.

I'm talking.

I'm saying this is a sound science fact right there.

Doggy bathroom.

I feel some tension here.

Hey, this is Obi-Wan, by the way.

This is the gruff the crime.

Obi-Wan, first of all, this is wild to me, too.

Isn't it?

He's a large doggy doggy.

Yeah.

You got a cartoon dog.

You got a trench coat on.

You got a trench coat.

He's a cartoon.

That's the other part.

He's drawn, which is very...

Thanks, guys.

We're on a hoo frame, Roger Reibit situation.

Roger Reibit.

That's right.

Hoo frame, Roger Norbit.

Now that's a single IT.

Oh, hell yeah.

So like, you're the crime dog.

You do crimes?

Oh, I don't do crime.

That's the big misunderstanding.

Oh, you are a crime.

I know, no, I'm not like Batman.

It's a crime that you exist.

No, I'm hit a war.

I mean, technically, yes.

I am hit a lot of nature.

I'm hit a war on children about crimes.

Oh, yeah.

And you know, the holiday season is a heavy time for crime.

Is there a lot of crime?

I know there's a lot of depression and stuff.

No crime?

There's a lot of crime.

Really?

There's a war going on outside.

No man is safe from.

I don't know what that is.

It's a reference to a rap song.

I say it every time I bought the show.

Oh, okay.

I guess I've never done a black list.

It is.

Is it the war against Christmas?

No, no, no.

That's some right-wing bullshit.

There's a lot of crime happening, Scott.

And I'm hit a war on your kid.

I think you're having me on, sorry.

Oh, of course.

Yeah, we have a lot of young listeners.

And a few black listeners as well.

Some are in this room.

Some of them are on the show.

Oh, yeah.

I want to warn the kids out there about crime, Scott.

There's a big crime that I've been noticing every Christmas.

Oh, what is this?

Santa impersonators, Scott.

Santa impersonators.

That's right.

Do you mean the people on the street corner who have the bell?

Those are more bells.

That's right.

That's who you're talking about?

The guys in the mall asking people to sit on their lap and tell them what they want.

I don't know that they're asking for it.

They're begging for it.

That's about just the kids one.

Sounds like someone I know.

Okay, someone who's asking for it.

Who's begging for it?

Oh, okay.

You're talking about me now?

Yeah.

I know you're talking about...

Do you guys just want to fight?

I'll give you one punch and then I'll have two hits.

You hit me, you hit in the floor.

Wait, I hit you, then I hit the floor.

To get down and say, I hit you.

This is reminding me a lot of my undercover work.

I went out to cover at the Michael Vick dog fighting ring.

Oh, he did.

Really?

I had to train for years to fight.

I watched a lot of dog violence then.

I'm not trying to see that again.

You brought in Vick.

Wow.

I brought him in.

Wow.

Now, let me tell you about these mall Santa's cut.

Okay, yeah.

Now, kids, if you see a Santa, tug on his beard.

If it's not a real beard, here's what I want you to do.

I want you to say, oh, Santa, hey, how's it going?

Do you know what I want for Christmas?

They tug on the beard?

You gotta play it cool.

Now you're undercover kids.

Okay.

Santa say, hey, Santa, this is really cool.

You know what I want for Christmas?

A PS5.

And you know what my mom wants for Christmas?

Wants you to come over and fuck her.

Okay.

You give him a time and date.

A time and date.

How far into the future are we?

I don't know.

Five, six days.

Don't be too thirsty.

Okay.

Because they'll know something's up.

Okay.

Really?

So it's that night.

That's right.

Something's up.

They're gonna know they're onto me.

They know I'm being a fraud.

How young of kids should be saying I want you to fuck my mom.

Any kid, if you're old enough to say the sentence, I need you to help me stop crying.

Just real quick.

Yeah.

I'm up to speed.

Yeah.

Santa is the red suit guy.

Yes.

You don't even know Santa Claus?

I'm clearly I do.

He said yes.

The red suit guy could be anyone.

Like who wears a red suit?

Daredevil.

Who's another red suit guy?

Eddie Murphy.

Sure, he's wrong.

Yeah.

Eddie Murphy and Ralph.

I don't know what you guys are talking about.

That was for the black listeners.

Hey, even I got that.

Come on, Scott.

Yeah, you could come in a cookout.

We've talked about this.

That's right.

We talked about this or?

No, no, no.

Is a dog allowed to invite people to cook out?

That's a good question.

Sometimes I'm not allowed.

A dog who's kind of a cop?

That's true.

And by the way.

What are you trying to say?

I'm out here serving the people.

Okay, so you tell Santa.

Hey, come into my house.

Fuck my mom.

Five, six days.

Five, six days later.

Give you enough time to set up a series of traps.

And then when he comes to your house, I want you to say, hey, Santa, come in.

My mom's upstairs.

She's really horny.

He starts walking.

What is your mom doing in this?

Oh, you've got to send her on a little vacation.

Send her on a vacation?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You can't let her know that any of this is happening.

So a fake sweepstakes or something?

I'll tell you what.

I find that a lot of parents are sort of implicated in this Santa thing.

They're saying that Santa's at the mall.

Oh, so you don't want- Just go all the way to the top.

It goes all the way to the top, which is your parents.

So when Santa comes to your house, trying to fuck your mom, I want you to lock him in the closet.

And how do you get him into the closet?

Say, my mom's in the closet and, oh, baby, she's so horny.

And she's lactating.

Who's the serious of traps?

Whackating?

Wait, who's the serious of traps for?

Oh, the serious of traps.

That's just a kissy-brick's of reindeer.

Oh, okay.

So there- Maybe it comes with- If it comes with backup, I need you to have some traps.

Those are like bear traps.

The fake Santa.

Oh, yeah.

Big bear trap.

Hold on a second.

But it's- This is to trap a fake Santa.

Yes.

Who will- Who doesn't come and have sex with the mom, but also brings live reindeer?

You'd be surprised.

You got to be ready for every situation.

I would be, honestly.

When you are going undercover, you got to be ready for every situation.

Every situation.

That's right.

Okay.

Now.

Strip them to a chair.

Oh, okay.

Strip them to a chair.

In the closet.

So you've trapped them in the closet, but then you got to open the closet.

Open the closet, put them in the chair.

What if- What if the fake Santa surprises you and goes, Ah!

Oh, you got a chloroforma sass.

Oh, oh, I see.

Okay.

And he should be wake up strapped to a chair.

Oh.

And then you want to put a towel over his head.

Start pouring water on him.

Waterboard?

Yeah, no waterboarda sass.

Okay, I'll do that.

And start asking, Hey, Santa, what's going to tell me what you've been doing?

You know, tell me what you've been doing, Santa.

And then once they confess, I want you to send a letter to me.

And scruff my graph.

What's the address?

Oh, man.

This is a bad time for you to forget.

Scruff my graph.

They have Santa in the closet.

Closin.

Well, what's confusing?

The guessboard.

The address is a name.

Oh, that's true.

I'm always like, what are the numbers?

No, it's scruff my graph.

Chicago, Illinois, 60652.

Scott.

Okay.

So- Let me ask you.

So- Yes.

They get satted to confess.

Yes.

They write a letter to you.

Yes.

What do they do with Santa after that?

Oh, well, you got to hold him there.

You got to build a little bit of a soggy.

How long does it take you to- To get back to him.

Well, the postal service is kind of fucked these days.

Right.

Because basically, you know, what we do.

So it takes like, I don't know, six, seven weeks.

I don't know that, I mean, that's a long vacation to send your mom away on.

That's a good point, Scott.

Maybe I need to rethink this whole thing.

I think you do.

Okay.

What about- Are the- Are the reindeer just rotting away at all the traps?

That's true.

And look, hopefully the reindeer dead.

You're skinning him, eating him for years.

What, I mean, you've- You're meat freezer.

So you're saying I should get an email?

What do you live in an apartment?

You know, I- Look, I don't fucking have all the answers, I'm just going to warn you about the crime.

All right.

Okay.

But you're also saying that you're the solution to it, that they should write you.

That's true.

And you- Yeah.

Get an email address.

Then you can have- Fuck a email address.

Fuck a email address.

Take you to get from Chicago to wherever the kids are, do you think?

Well, it depends.

Sometimes I don't get to- I'm not able to buy a ticket for a- Because they're just like a dog, can't just buy a ticket.

So they want you in cargo?

They want me in one of those, you know, stuprates.

Crates and they put me under like- And a lot of dogs don't make it out of there.

They put you under.

No, under the plane, Scott.

Under the plane.

Yeah, it is down there.

I cannot bog there under the plane.

Sure.

Scott, I- I gotta warn these kids about another crime.

There's another crime?

That's right, Scott.

Are there more than two crimes?

Or is this the- The final crime.

You know what?

We can probably make it the final crime.

Oh, he's allowed the name crimes, but I can't name rocks.

You named five!

He's only named one crime.

I'm just begging you to name five rock.

So we're equal on the begging, then.

You know what? Fair enough.

I like you.

I like you again.

Yeah, we're friends.

All right, we're good friends.

All right, this crime's got- We're best friends.

I don't know.

Oh, I don't know.

I feel like you guys are gonna kill each other by the end of the- I'm gonna stop.

Maybe.

Got to take one of you to jail.

Oh, no.

This crime, Scott.

Let's say you wake up.

It's Christmas Day.

Okay.

You're family.

I hope- I hope that comes true.

So what do you say?

Like I've died my sleep.

Christmas Eve for me.

Okay, for you.

Yeah, I'm sure you don't look that healthy.

What's that, Scott?

Yeah.

That's pretty obvious.

Fuck you.

Scott, why are you saying, fuck you, you get sweet stuff?

Speak to us!

I've had it.

What's happening to you, Scott?

I've had it in 2022.

This is fucked, Scott.

All right, you wake up.

Christmas Day.

Yeah.

Your family's gone.

Family's gone.

E-rap, Joe's.

That's true.

That's true?

What?

He thinks, baby, it's the rapture.

It could be.

It's true that you think that.

Maybe it's the- maybe it's the leftovers.

You walk around, you say, where are my parents?

And you go, I've got the household to myself.

I'm basically describing Home Alone, Scott.

Right.

Yeah.

If you're a parent- And that's a crime?

Yeah.

If your parents leave you at home alone?

Who committed the crime?

The parents are you- That's right.

It's the parents, Scott.

It's the parents.

Okay, got it.

So here's what I want you to- So if you've been home alone- Yes.

Here's what I want you to do.

Go to the airport.

Okay.

Sneak past security.

Okay.

See, this is the part.

It's like those- It's like when they get the recipes on Great British Bake Off that have no instructions.

Mm-hmm.

You know, like how do- hours people supposed to sneak off?

I say pay attention to all the details, and then I say sneak past security.

All right, I'll give you one detail.

Tip toe, it helps.

Okay, all right.

All right.

Make sure you're not doing the noise.

Bum-bum-bum-bum.

Yeah, you know what I'm doing?

That noise, but tip toe past security.

I want you to get on a plane, and I want you to fly to wherever your family left you to.

And then I want you to go there, and then I want you to buy a gun, Scott.

Okay.

Find like one of those, you know, one of those gun shows where you don't have to do a background check.

It's very easy to buy a pistol.

Right, yeah.

Hopefully it's the weekend where a gun- like, a gun shows are like weekend things.

Oh, yeah, totally.

That's why they got like week day things.

No, that's why they call it the freaking weekend.

Oh, that's right.

I want you to buy a gun.

I want you to find your parents in whatever hotel room they're in.

And I want you to bust through the door.

I want you to say, get on the ground, mom.

Get on the ground, dad.

What'd you like?

I'm in the closet.

I'm getting a more closet.

Cloraphone?

It depends.

Yeah.

Yeah, they get some chloroform just in case, but I don't know where kids are getting chloroform, by the way.

Oh, we'll cut them out.

I don't know where I could get chloroform.

All you got to do is go to my website, Scott.

Oh, really?

That's right.

So you have a website, you don't have an email.

Yeah, I do have like a contact to be section of the website, but I don't check it.

Okay, that's the email.

I don't want to tell you your job, but you should tell kids to take the iron board out of the closet, because those closets and the hotels are tight.

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Remove the ironing board and remove the hairdryer.

Put your parents in the closet.

Maybe you want to board them a little bit.

And then I want you to send a letter to me at Scruff-mograph.

Chicago, Illinois, say it with me, Scott.

Six.

So I don't know what the numbers are.

We'll find my email address.

I think my email address is Scruffy Doggy69.

Scruffy Doggy69, horny for the weekend at gmail.com.

And the weekend, I'm talking about the singing.

Oh, horny for the weekend?

Yeah, that's right, Scott.

He's hot.

You like him.

He's sexy as hell, Scott.

Okay, but you're a dog.

I mean, you should be dating other dogs.

Well, yeah, but we all know that, of course, I divorced Lassie a long time ago.

Oh, that's right.

Yeah, I'm ready.

She did honor with Lady.

And I got- Did you Lady in the tramp lady?

We've talked about this, yes, Scott.

Wait.

Well, it was- Is my mind going to exactly the same question that I- Wait, Scott.

But maybe I'll give you a different answer.

Maybe I'll give you a different answer.

I put one little, like, thing of spaghetti in a vagina, and then I ate all the way to it.

Okay.

Then I just fucking went to town.

That's a different answer?

I think it might be.

I love eating pussy, Scott.

How about- Oh, okay.

All right.

McGruff.

I don't know.

Why are you so pissed all of a sudden?

It's a great time of year.

It isn't- It's a wonderful time of year.

It is filled with cheer, but, you know, I mean, I don't appreciate you coming on here and talking about Connellingus right before the holidays.

I'm a father now.

Okay.

Well, what did he give you a life for Christmas?

Oh.

That's the only thing on her list.

I forgot.

Yes, Scott.

Huge checker list twice.

I only checked once.

It's crazy, Scott.

It is crazy.

You're saying that like you have something else you wanted to say.

I could also go into another crime.

All right.

I can easily go into one other crime.

Scott.

If you see any reindeer games going on.

And I think reindeer games might be with like Ben Affleck is robbing a casino or something.

Right.

If you see that happening, put him in a closet, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water.

Yeah, everything, all the other things.

Yeah, Scott, it's pretty easy.

Okay.

Good.

I'm glad we went back for that.

Great, Scott.

Thank you, McGruff.

All you're welcome.

It is McGruff.

Yeah, it's not Scruff McGruff.

What is the Scruff McGruff?

Scruff McGruff was my little assistant that I used to have.

Oh.

And he was supposed to be the one to relate to children, of course.

Oh.

He was killed in the line of fire.

KIA?

Yeah, that's right, Scott.

Oh my god.

That's right.

We were, yeah, we were leaving Michael Vick's house.

I was walking in.

He was doing the perp walk.

Oh no.

So he was leading Michael Vick out.

He was leading Michael- Little honey dog.

That's right, Scott.

And Andre Ryzen, one of the Atlanta Falcons, shot him from the house.

He said you can't be taking my quarterback for me.

Oh my god.

So Scruff is dead.

I'm so sorry.

I honor him by letting that address stand.

I'm so sorry.

Well, it's wonderful to have you.

Wonderful to have you, too, Scott.

You and Obi-Ron here can commiserate and create.

I gotta say, we're great first guests for this show.

I think so.

Me and Obi-Ron, we come in.

We have established that it's Christmas.

Everyone's happy.

This is great.

I know who Santa is.

You know who Santa is.

You know who Eddie Murphy is now.

Well, the red suit guy.

He was Norman.

You were- Well, I haven't explained that to him.

All right.

I know it's either the break.

You would have to.

Okay. All right.

I would like you to explain Norbit, though.

I gotta be honest.

I don't even fucking know.

He was like a nerd or something.

He was a nerd and he grew up with someone.

I don't fucking know, Scott.

Yeah.

I barely remember the plot.

I remember seeing it.

You know what Eddie Murphy movie I like?

What's that?

The one with the white guy.

48 hours?

No.

Trading places.

No.

Mm.

I'm running out of white guys.

Steve Martin.

Never thought I'd say that.

What's up with the bow finger?

Bow finger.

Yeah.

It's fun.

It's a good one.

Yeah.

I love what he runs across the highway.

And then he says, Laker girls.

Laker girls?

Yeah.

He like exposes himself to the Laker girls.

Oh.

Oh, okay.

He's wearing a trench coat.

And I gotta say that I love.

He's wearing a trench coat in the blue beard.

You look- You'll have all trench coat movies.

Spectral gadget.

Yeah.

Bow finger.

I will say trench coats got a pretty bad rap somewhere rather early 2000s.

Well, yeah.

Sure.

I mean, anytime you see a trench coat nowadays, someone exposing themselves.

Yeah.

You don't do that, right?

What?

Well, look, dogs expose themselves all the time.

You get a recipe for some of my dick.

That's the thing.

It should be illegal.

My little doggy dick.

Your little lipstick.

It should be illegal for dogs to be naked.

So what are we supposed to do?

We have clothes.

Yeah.

I think so.

I mean, you're already wearing the trench coat.

You know my dick look like a candy cane.

You just know what those are.

Oh, B-Rod.

I was trying to cut that right.

I mean, I have a better- Actually, I have a better- A conception of it now.

Because doggy dick is natural.

Doggy dick is natural.

Doggy dick is fun.

Doggy dick is best once one of us.

When we graph, I keep trying to dismount from you.

Hey, well, you know, what can I say?

I'm an interesting guy, Scott.

I'm an interesting dog.

And I did want to tell you my entire life story from the beginning.

Okay.

Yeah.

I'm getting into it.

So, all right.

So first I was bought.

What's going on out there?

And levels sound good.

Whenever you're ready, Scott will just get ripping on this.

Tina, we've been going for it.

It's holiday special or we'll have to call this the Christmas special.

What the fuck's happening over here?

You can call the Xmas Christmas special, whatever you want to call it.

I just, we've been recording for 10 minutes already.

Would you call your country a cunt?

What?

I don't know.

I heard that once at Nassau Community College.

Some frad bro.

I'm all d- I'm in disarray.

I'm sorry I was late.

There's some lady in the- In turns in disarray?

In turns in disarray.

There's some fucking- I'm in Marina Belray in full disarray, baby.

I went outside and there's one of your receptionists is lathering up her crotch with peanut butter, saying McGruff is here.

And she's going to have a hello in the afternoon.

Oh shit.

And now I know who she's referring to.

I thought I was in a take on me situation for a second.

I don't think it's a McGruff.

Yeah, because- Oh, because he's a cartoon.

Yeah, and I've never actually seen a cartoon IRL, as the fucking kids say, you know, TRRL, IRL.

Right.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm such a- Hi, you know.

Hi, I see holidays to you.

Merry Christmas, you- You too, welcome in.

Okay, so you're- I'm an atheist.

Oh, okay.

What do you care of them?

Because I'm a capitalist.

Oh, all right.

Christmas is the fucking capitalist holiday of the fucking year.

Yeah, you must be very happy during the season.

I'm so fucking- I'm getting so much extra work, shovel and snow that I'm making fucking money hand over fist.

I didn't know you did that for all the time.

Guess why?

It pays more than fucking working in the podcast industry, okay?

You're kind of a tiny guy out there shoveling snow.

It sounds like it'd be difficult for you.

I do.

I have an elaborate system where I bring- those pocket hand heater things.

Yeah.

I buy about a quarter million of them a year.

You're in the meltups?

No.

In the summer when they're super, super cheap.

And then I bring them out to winter and I throw them out.

And people's driveways and I'm like, five, six hours, I'll come back here and squeegee the water off and you're goochy.

Wow.

How many does this- I mean, it must take hundreds.

It takes about 200- Well, you know, these fuckers on Long Island, they got these big-ass lawns, these big-ass fucking trucks.

Everyone's cosplaying as a fucking blue-collar guy.

Everyone's like, yeah, I'm a working class.

I make 285 grand a year owning a dealership.

And it's like- Is that what- Long Island!

That's a fuck save, my friend.

Jesus.

That was for you.

You know where it is.

Come on.

I have no contact- If you're ever in Manhattan, have you heard of that?

I think you go on like six week Broadway vacations there or whatever.

And fuck easily.

Blow the guy at the TKTS booth for a fucking extra ticket.

So you're blowing guys and you're not licking your wife's- What's it called?

This Avenue Q?

You're not licking your wife's pussy.

Okay.

Jesus Christ.

Okay, we should- Oh, sorry.

We should put some peanut butter on there.

How are the lofts?

My level's just exploded in my ear there for a second.

Oh, sorry.

I'm trying to- I'm trying to rub up against the lofts.

I'm trying to adjust the lofts.

You almost killed me.

Oh, sorry.

I'm super fucking excited.

I had to fucking- What's going on?

Take an UberX here from Long Island.

It's great.

You haven't been on it at a while.

It's great to see you.

I've been fucking broke from Long Island.

Yeah, I wish I could have taken an Uber Black, but they have no fucking cash.

I lost it all in the fucking Long Island crypto crash.

Oh, no.

I didn't know about the Long Island specific crypto crash.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Of course you didn't because I fucking sunk my- All my retirement money and every elementary school teacher's retirement money.

No.

Yup.

Judd Apatow did this commercial for a fucking crypto company.

So I thought, hey, if a celebrity's doing this, I gotta get on board.

You know, the commercial was two and a half hours long and you really only need to be 30 to 60 seconds.

But- He was indulging, but funny at some points.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Who's Judd Apatow is he like a guy that people- Oh, shit.

How do you- Oh, shit.

How do you- I mean, it's hard to explain.

He's a- He's a long island guy.

He's a director, but somehow he's famous?

Yeah.

He's kind of- He's an otter if you ask him, you know?

And I don't know how else to describe the guy.

He was the writer of Heavyweights, but he's a trusted source for financial play.

On Long Island?

Look, it's anti-semitic, but yes, we trust him.

Okay.

Don't carry your arvin out here.

No.

Okay.

I don't- Hey, look, I'm from Long Island.

I've been to 200 boss mitzvahs.

I fucking got it.

Okay, I'm cool.

Larry David also did one of those commercials.

Oh, Larry David.

I- Because that's the thing.

Because in the commercial, the one Apatow directed that got me hooked.

Signfels in that.

And he's like, you can- With this crypto money, with blockchain, no one keeps track of what high schoolers you buy in plane tickets for.

And it was like, all this super fucking ex- Yeah, no.

You didn't see this commercial?

I didn't see that one, I guess.

It was airing during the islanders' pre-season.

We're not watching the islanders' combine, where they have like the little high school kids competing different.

Oh, like I did.

No.

It's called Skink, Putt and Pass, and they skate and the Putt and the fucking Pass.

It's wild.

You should check it out.

I should check it out.

You should check it out, because you would have seen this commercial, but I'm glad you didn't, because you probably have more money than me, because you do all the work in this podcast.

So you got, you got clearly printed money.

You're really coming out swinging.

Hey, you know, I don't come off in nine months.

I gotta get it all in.

I'll see you guys next Christmas.

All right, I know who I am now.

I'm like that fucking uncle that the voice ran.

Then you only invite over for the holidays.

Oh, come on now.

You've turned me down several times.

No, I'm Bill.

I'm fucking broke, dude.

You know, you get fucking- You got that guarantee from the owner of the Amityville Horror House, that if you bet on their blockchain NFTs, you could get a ghost voice NFT delivered to your phone, and use it as a voicemail.

Well, I know fucking God.

Fucking quarter million dollars.

I lost the quarter million dollars from my brother-in-law's retirement fund.

He's a pediatric oncologist.

He's a what?

A pediatric oncologist.

Okay, that's one of the most depressed jobs in the world.

Yeah, he's awful to be around.

Oh, see, you know about that?

Yeah.

It's not about culture.

Okay.

Yeah, thank you very much.

That guy's up to speed.

He just got here.

Do you know who the good- I was listening to the levels on the driveover, because I got an email from someone over the front over.

Yeah, in the UberX, I have the level set up because I need a remote record because somebody gave everyone plastic wrapped candies for the audio recording.

Uh-oh.

Do you know who the good doctor is, by the way, Obi-Wan?

There's only one.

Okay, nevermind.

Zeyus.

Bad news.

He's an orangutan, and his name is Zeyus.

He's my proctologist.

I need a longer finger.

I've always said that.

That's what I'm saying.

This is the one time it comes out to be in a medical conversation and not just in a garage situation.

Well, Jano, I'm so sorry that you lost all of your money.

I mean, and you had none to begin with.

I know I lost 22 credits in Nassau Community College.

I'm bumped down.

They took your credits.

They took my credits.

I realized they could put a lean on them.

I was pressing it pretty hard.

I had won the credits.

I had put some credits in Powerball.

Hit on that on a small one.

So I got a few extra credits.

So you were going to graduate.

I was so close about one try.

All I had to do was take some dumb art class.

But no, I fucking blew it by demanding on being the nude model and then getting hard.

Oh, I'm so sorry, Jano.

Yeah.

Well, what gave you the, if you don't mind me asking.

Well, you know, I think it's because I have a performer's background that the idea of being nude in front of people is hot.

You know?

I don't think it's the performer's background.

Are you sure?

What is it?

Because I like to just, like I was up there and I were like, hey, hit a pose for us.

So I hit him with the mm most muscular.

If you're a bodybuilder, you know what I'm referring to.

Of course.

Of course, it's like, back down double, double, double, double, you want to hit that double by?

You can get the frustration of the tricep.

You and I are probably being weird.

We've been trained together.

It's wild squatting with you.

I know we have to frame it over here.

We have to keep training the fucking.

You call me that, yeah.

We have to keep moving the fucking pins up and down.

This guy's fucking yacked up on creatine, demanding phone calls for Shocktail 2.

I am trying to.

Well, you were like, I just want to be like a gal.

I got a situation with Shark Tank where I do my own.

Yo, I know.

I listened to that whole pitch for Shark Tank 2 and it's just Shark Tanks and there's no, they don't.

I went on Shark Tank to pitch it.

No, this is so confusing.

They were very insulted.

Mark Cuban almost backed you, but you're a good thing he didn't because he fucking ruined the haunted hay right here in Los Angeles.

So I'm glad he didn't ruin.

That's true.

That is fucking true.

It went downhill since the guy had a real investment from Mark Cuban.

Why do I know that?

Because I'm out here every october acting in a haunted house because it's part of my internship here at Earwolf.

Or Stitcher.

Or is it Raytheon yet?

I'm not quite sure what it is.

So now you're going to have to start over with all the credits?

I have to start over.

I'm technically a sophomore again, which is good for me though because then I could pretend to be dumb at the bar and shit like that.

Oh, that's true.

Yeah, for like role playing purposes.

I'm like, I'm just a sophomore.

You've been on this show for now, eight years or something like that, right?

Yeah, it's been 10 years or so.

So you another 10?

Yeah, well, yeah.

Well, who knows?

Hopefully I can, because I'm going to take some night classes.

Oh good.

Yeah.

And I'm going to hopefully get a minor in like flail and shield and...

I'm glad you can see me with that sentence after I'm going to get a minor.

Oh yeah, yeah.

I'm going to...

Please.

Unless I'm a fuck the coal miner, I nearly got fucking asbestos lung from this guy coffin in my asshole.

This guy coughed in my asshole so much.

I choked.

You know what I mean?

Has that ever happened to you?

Not exactly what you mean.

Thank you.

Oh, you know about that?

I'll be wrong.

It's not Bob Cauch.

I take care of my health.

I have regular checkouts for everything.

How regular?

Was a week?

Once a week for everything.

Not for once a week.

Really, you get x-rayed.

You go to every single thing once a week.

I go once a week for this, once a week for that.

Once a week for this.

Okay, that seems like a waste of time.

Well, I'm 150 years old.

Oh, holy shit.

You look fucking amazing.

Oh, this is a new information, Obi-ra.

Holy shit.

I'm only five.

But that's like almost a hundred.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Thirty-five.

Yeah, and cartoon doggies.

Yeah.

Oh my god.

Well, hold as hell.

It's preventative medicine.

Oh, okay.

Okay, now that you took off your glasses, you, I see it.

Right.

You definitely are.

I'm a very old guy.

Never touched my eyes.

Never got anything.

My eyes.

They're really haunting those 150 year old eyes.

They just keep receding back and back and back in there.

So chalky.

The things you've seen, I mean, you were talking about things you've seen before, but my god.

Yeah.

Everything you've seen with those old ass eyes.

They look like Betty Davis's.

They do.

Like Betty Davis eyes.

Do you know what that is?

No.

No one said that phrase, but you.

Whoa.

Robyn.

Rosemary.

Robyn.

Rosemary.

Obi-Wan.

Kado.

Lee.

Rach.

Yeah, this is Gina Lombardi.

This is Gina Lombardi.

This is Robynon.

What's Robynon?

Robynon is a screenplay I wrote about an Italian grandmother who is dies in a horrible accident, comes back.

And the pre-builder.

Yeah.

I've given him a lot.

That's more of a commentary on capitalism.

It's a Detroit drug addiction.

I've given Gina a lot of notes on it.

You refuse this to take any of them.

Wow.

Yeah, you keep saying it's too broad.

And I don't even know what the fuck that means.

So you just round it.

You cut out all the women characters at one point.

Well, yeah.

Well, it got a little too broad for me.

And I don't get broad humor.

You know, I got titties.

They bounce.

LOL.

All right.

It's pretty funny.

I know it actually after I said it, I was like, that one's actually good.

Yeah.

I know as you would to your notes happen.

I'm just a little still pissed off because Schumer fucked me big Chuck and Amy.

You just both of them, Jack D.

Yeah.

Well, what happened?

Well, that, see, I didn't know it was then when we, I, yes, I had consensual sex with Chuck and Amy Schumer in a sort of ancestral polycool type situation.

But what I was referring to is they fucked me because they were big in the ad too.

They were like, and we, I put all my inside Amy Schumer residuals in this crib though.

No.

I was like, you get residuals on that shit, man.

That's some fucking thing.

See, this is what Jay Leno doesn't do because he doesn't even spend those.

I know he refuses to spend this tonight.

He doesn't put those into crypto.

No.

Well, he's, he's invested something.

I won't be doing it.

What is that?

It's that's you banks.

Oh, yeah.

I thought that was the side bill.

It doesn't use banks.

Hey, I'm all crypto.

I'm all black.

Jay, no use banks.

Kevin, use banks.

That's what my uncle would call him.

Well, Gino, I'm, I'm so sorry you're going to have to be here another 10 years to graduate, but.

You got to be fucking.

We're happy to have you.

I was wondering if I would get to ride the podcast industry all the way down.

All the way down the street.

I wrote it, I wrote it kind of halfway up towards the end there and I'm ready to ride it all the way down.

You'll get to the end of it.

Yeah.

I can't fucking win.

I wonder who the last podcast will be.

It's going to be, it's going to be, unfortunately, someone who we like now and is very right wing.

Oh my gosh.

All right.

We'll be like Randy Snutz's assumption.

Maybe he got any.

Maybe a guy named John Gabris is something.

That guy, he's one of my favorite comedians, that guy.

He's very good.

Funny.

And there's something fun about liking a comedian that you've actually never really seen do comedy.

It's been about nine years and heard the guy talk about stuff.

That's kind of funny.

How would we ever have seen him do comedy?

Exactly.

He doesn't have a special.

He barely books stuff.

Well, he does have that great show.

He has 101 places to party before you die.

Which is on HBO Max right now.

He's on HBO Max.

He's on HBO Max the other day.

Yeah, formally it was on True TV.

So you had to have been in a car accident and broken up in a hospital where it was currently playing.

But now...

What happened to a few of my friends?

But now it's on there.

Yeah, well, luckily, thank fucking God they did.

Because luckily John Gabris was able to not hear anything about a second season due to corporate mergers is what he keeps saying on his podcast that I listen to.

Interesting.

Well, it's a great, I told him that I unfortunately watched one of those episodes the night before my colonoscopy when I had to be fasting.

And it drove me crazy.

They were eating such delicious stuff and I couldn't have anything.

He recommends watching it during.

Really?

Yeah.

During the colonoscopy?

Yeah, yeah.

He says he loves like...

What's supposed to be a...

You have a picture in picture.

Where you see the...

It's a picture in picture.

You know, you see the show.

And then...

And that's...

I heard they were doing that for the second season where him and the dude from...

Happy...

From all those ones.

Yeah, the Sonic guy.

Yeah.

The live action Sonic guy.

Yeah, yeah.

Sonic I like.

He...

Yeah.

He fucking...

This dude is gonna fucking...

He's gonna get us colonoscopy cams and they're gonna be live right there while we...

While you're there.

That's perfect.

So we'll be hammering.

Just to see all the damage that they are doing.

Yeah, all the blood that...

You know, we're gonna see the blood finally.

Okay.

This said blood in blood out.

Like the crypts.

This says great.

I get colonoscopies like four times a year.

Four times a year.

Totally.

I love that Twilight sleep is the best.

You're getting more propofol than Dr. Conrad Murray.

I know the guy that's a lot of propofol.

He gave a lot of it away.

To one guy specifically.

Well then of course I have more than...

Are you familiar with this guy?

Waco Jacko?

I think people still call that.

It was Waco Jacob.

Oh, Waco Jacob.

He was for Waco.

Is that staeful?

I don't know either of these dudes.

That's just a reference for the black people that look white.

Oh, okay.

Got it.

And they listen.

And they totally listen.

Well, do you know we need to get to our next guest?

Please.

That's right.

I didn't even mean to talk this much.

I know.

Have you poured the waters?

I can't do it.

I have a few waters.

You poured approximately one water.

I unwrapped everyone's candies for them so they could just straight up eat them.

And I don't have to...

I appreciate it.

Okay.

So no, no more crinkling.

All right.

Let's get...

Who are you?

Some sort of fucking YA author.

Put that shit down and you fucking prick.

Well, let's get to our next guest.

She sees a social media expert.

She's here to give us tips about social media.

Please welcome back to the show for Inchesco Bolognes.

Jesus fucking Christ.

No, I am not a social media expert.

Like, do not give tip.

How many times I have to tell you?

I'm sorry.

You give advice about social media?

Advice is what you can do.

I don't give anything.

I guess I know about it.

But why I didn't...

What's one tip?

That's another why I am here.

One tip about social media.

Don't fucking be a fucking idiot.

He's still defying media.

Let the note chat out again for this one.

That is what this is.

I'm so sorry.

You're so sick.

I'm not sick.

What are you eating?

I'm so sorry you're dying.

I know you're eating.

I'm so sad that you're almost dead.

What are you talking about?

You're not sick?

I'm not sick.

No, I mean, people have said I don't look all that well.

Why do you look like that?

Why do I look like what?

Why do you look like you dying?

I don't think I look like I'm dying.

You really look so sick.

I'm so worried for you.

All right, nice to have you.

You need to get to our next guest.

Well, no, I just got here.

Thanks for it.

Yeah, I know.

You'll miss me.

Begin.

I don't know what it is with characters these days.

Ask you if I miss them.

I don't miss...

You miss me so much.

I don't miss my guests when they're not on.

Well, can I ask if everybody else is asking?

Did you miss me?

No, I did not.

Well, I barely remembered you were alive until you showed up here today.

What about me?

I bet you miss me so much.

I miss you.

I miss you too.

It's been such a long time.

I feel like it's been since last Christmas.

That's Gensho's only get together on Christmas.

Yeah, we do.

We do.

She's like a wacky aunt.

You know, wacky aunt.

Wacko Jacko.

You're like my big son.

Thank you.

Because you know I have one for Paul.

You're one for Paul.

That was established.

OK, I can't tell because...

I know Thanksgiving is special.

Not a lot of people have heard but you stuck to it.

I got a lot of trouble for staring at a woman's breast one.

So I locked into your eyes.

I had no idea the rest of how...

You want me to do my stand up for you?

My stand up routine?

I have a titties.

A bounce, a bounce, a bounce.

No!

Oh shit.

Holy fashies.

That is more.

Are you a comedian?

I am a comedian on the side.

That is good stuff.

Really?

I didn't realize it.

Yeah, I didn't even have a thought.

I think everybody hears a comedian on the side.

I don't know why.

I don't know.

Oh, you've been to Chicago.

I owe theater.

You see bees.

I do all the comedy.

I was a narrow team.

So you're here to give us...

I was jealous.

God, you never made a team now.

I never made the team now.

No, I wish you'd ever hear, never made it.

I'm so sorry for you.

Maybe that's your whole thing.

Why you're so bitter?

Yeah.

I don't think it's why you have a podcast.

I mean, every guest that you've had on this show so far...

Hey, T.

You've insulted them?

Not Gino.

Not me.

Yeah.

Gino and I have a great relationship.

We're working.

He's going to get fucking out.

That's right.

We're working out every single morning.

So we have a bond.

We're training.

We're doing fucking Fen-Fenn recreationally.

We're fucking cranking creatine.

I got him on winstrels and deballs and weedes steroids.

Halloween, we had so much fentanyl in November 1st.

It was great.

We went out together collecting.

Okay, so what guy that you're not here for?

Out of four of you?

Why is he so funny?

And these three are three of the most obnoxious people I've ever had.

No, that's so funny.

I don't know why.

You used to be chill.

I'm still chill, dude.

You've turned prickly.

I'm chill as well.

I have two guns.

I tell you something though.

I am a chill dude.

But you introduced me by saying I don't remember anything about it.

Well, I didn't.

I'm sorry.

Well, you don't have to say that out loud.

It's rude.

I did.

Have to say it out loud.

Otherwise, people will say, well, who is he?

Why isn't Scott telling us anything about him?

But you're not gonna die to host the show.

Maybe not.

You think you are?

Guys, look.

I mean, I couldn't do worse.

Let's try to listen.

It'd be nice to see you dying.

I'm not dying.

Guys, look, what I do.

This happens around the holidays.

There's a lot of tension.

I feel like by the end of this episode, we should all just be in a better place.

There is a lot of tension during the holidays.

Let's just calm down.

You're right.

Okay, we'll fight you with our family.

Just let me host for a little bit.

Okay, we'll let obiranos.

Okay.

All right.

Okay, here we go.

We're gonna start fresh with like we're bringing in Francesca.

Okay, okay, okay, okay.

Good.

Well, Francesca, don't try not to be such a bitch when you...

Jesus Christ.

Do you know how I go?

Do you get it?

Scott.

No, Scott, you're here yourself.

This is right.

If you're hosting, the guy who's not hosting is supposed to be undercutting and ruining it as much as possible.

At least the last couple of times I've come here, I've picked up on the pattern.

I'm well.

So let's see what you got.

That's news to me.

All right, let's host, bitch.

You should listen back to me sometime.

Here you're so stupid.

Hey, guys.

Why is this so freaking freezing in here?

You can't afford it.

Wait, I haven't introduced you.

Okay, sorry.

Welcome back to podcast.

And we got another great guest.

In addition to the two great guests, we already have.

And this lady, she comes all the way from another country, and she's very interesting.

And I'd like to hear all about her, because I love to hear about people.

Wow.

Please welcome Francesca Bolinazin.

Hi, oh my God.

That's so nice to be here.

What a beautiful intro.

Absolutely.

Francesca, how are you today?

How are you doing?

I am so good.

I am saving Bebeth and Beyond all by myself.

Bebeth and Beyond.

That's a company, right?

Yes, it's a company.

Where do you go?

Towels.

You can buy dishwasher.

You can buy other towel.

What's the craziest thing that's ever happened to you?

Bebeth and Beyond.

Um, some stupid fucking piece of shit that came in on.

Namos, go talkerman.

I've never been into Bebeth and Beyond.

Hey, guys.

I have never been.

Begging me.

Where are the deals, those?

I don't know.

We don't say that.

Please, please tell me where the deals are.

I say, I don't know.

Now, do you have any pieces of shit I can eat?

You should be doing this.

Shut the fuck up.

This is a good interview.

I said, you can go to the bathroom.

He said, oh, please.

I'm so hungry.

I need this shit to eat.

Wow.

Is he the worst customer you've ever had?

Ah, yes.

He is one of the worst people.

I think on planet Earth.

But I love him and he is dying.

Wow.

Please pray for him.

You're kind of the hero.

I am the hero.

I really am the hero.

This is my cause.

I want to save the planet and I want to save sad people, even like a Scott Ockerman.

Wow.

What do you think is the biggest threat facing the planet today?

And don't say Scott Ockerman.

I think it's podcast, but honestly, it's a virus.

It's a disease.

This is super boring.

No.

Does anyone feel like that?

You think it's boring?

Yeah, this is very, but two people agreeing with each other?

Come on.

I've been trying to figure out how many dimensions McGruff is this entire time.

I'm fucking confused, man.

I think he's two.

I'm two and a quarter.

But he's existing.

That's what I would say.

He's got a little bit of depth around the crotch right around my little lipstick.

Yeah.

You're like the width of an animation cell.

That's right.

I got to say, Obi-Wan, that was an incredible interviewing.

Hey, thanks, Matt.

Those are some great questions.

I felt like the mood in here was very chill.

Thanks.

That's what I try to break to podcast.

Yeah.

Well, you're not successful because you're kind of an asshole.

Jesus.

Weird.

Mix reviews because one day said I was great, and then you said I was an asshole.

Yeah.

While.

Interesting how two people could have two different.

Real interesting.

Yeah.

So that would be a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is not good, not passing.

Okay.

Well.

Damn, Scott.

We'll see.

We'll see how.

Do you know what Rotten Tomatoes is, by the way?

I know what a Rotten Tomato is.

It's a website.

No, it's not.

It's a tracks review.

It's a tomato that's not good anymore.

Francesca, how would you rate my interview experience?

What a transition.

I give it a 92.

Uh oh, looks like I'm doing better than I'm not doing good.

So I'm great and you are the worst.

No, 150 plus 92 is 242, divide by three is 80%, which is still not great.

80% is not great?

No, not.

I mean, according to my parents.

It's a huge majority.

Okay.

80% get you a full ride to Nassau Community College.

That's right.

When you say full ride, what are you talking about?

You are the Dean, let's you sit and spin.

Yes, that's right.

I thought I was the horny one.

Francesca, I got a question.

You horny guests?

Now, what's Bed Bath and Beyond like during the holidays?

Um, well, so right now Bed Bath and Beyond is in a very bad place.

Nobody wants to shop there.

Nobody wants to eat there.

No, if you want to do anything there.

There are sometimes have shit you can eat.

Are you not paying attention to the story?

I'm not paying attention to the story.

So what I'm doing is I'm revamping the whole situation to make a Bed Bath and Beyond very cool.

Very cool place to be.

And how do we do that?

I think my idea is I make it like, you know, when you go to a very nice LA restaurant and the hostess is a super fucking big beach to you, that's what I do at Bed Bath and Beyond.

Oh, I like that when you show up there and you go, oh, I'm sorry.

I guess I misunderstood what your job here is at the restaurant.

Yes, I thought I was allowed to ask you questions maybe how I get food or drink from you and this establishment.

Exactly, yes.

But these beautiful fucking women just love.

Gorgeous.

Staring at you going, are you?

I'm sorry.

You came here to get a fucking bite to eat.

Gorgeous.

Fucking big, I mean, if you're a big fucking dummy, that's what it looks like they're saying to you.

I'm a little creep, so I'm used to it in a different area.

Well, by the time they're usually there, like a brunette woman, but her eyebrows are bleached.

Oh, yeah.

You know, that kind of vibe.

Very big pants.

Yeah, very big shoes.

Very small jackets.

Tiny, tiny jackets.

Tiny jacket.

Long, long fingernail.

She says, do you?

I'm so sorry.

She's a top hat, like long stringy hair, and she represents depression.

And right?

She's very rich, bud.

She works at her.

Wait a second.

How many about the Babadook?

Oh, that's not sorry.

I got too confused for a second.

That's what I was thinking about.

But yeah, but they are the tall, very similar vibe.

Very similar vibe.

Have you ever been to a restaurant, Scott?

Yes, of course I've been to her.

Why are you including me?

I thought I was supposed to be sitting there.

I can't wait for you.

You're dying.

I want to make sure.

I want to go to one last restaurant.

All right, Dad.

Are you?

Imagine your make-o-ish was to sit in on this podcast.

That's the one.

Jesus.

You're sitting there rooting for your leukemia to kick up.

Speed.

All right, let's start.

Miss Dastasizing.

Wrap this shit up.

Oh, no.

Wrap this shit up.

My scuba take.

Hey, let me ask you, Francesca.

Not trucks.

You do deep dives.

Is your goal to make Bed Bathsopion like the community hub where everybody hangs out?

You know, that's where the real discussions happen.

Absolutely.

My goal is to make it feel like a very cool club where everybody, you know, you have to pay admission.

You are lucky that you are there.

Everyone is so cool.

You are surrounded by towels.

You should just sell drugs.

You need a fire nearby.

There is a bunch of candy cane sometimes they sell.

Sure, yeah.

I know with those.

Passifiers.

That's a fire.

What are they?

If a cat were to- I don't know if I can say it on the podcast.

I mean, I was filthy as you guys are.

Candy canes?

Yeah.

Okay.

But you should just sell drugs.

That should be the beyond drug.

Now hold on.

You're what?

McGruff.

I mean, oh, Francesca, be cool.

Okay, yeah, be good.

He's a cop.

Shit, this is weird because I love dogs and hate cops.

I'm in such a fucking weird situation here right now.

Yeah.

You don't want to pick them up.

I don't know.

I'm freaked out by that expression even.

ACAB.

All cats are best.

Thank you.

That's what I'm excited to say.

He's lying on his back.

He won me rub his thumb.

Rub it.

Do you want me to rub it?

No, be careful.

He's got an extra quarter dimension down there.

I like to get very low.

McGruff, do you work with the police or are you like a vigilante?

Well, I do work with the police.

I am, of course, as legitimate as Herschel Walker is.

You have one of those- Honorary bad jokes.

You're like Steve with that.

Law law, man.

Yeah, I've got one of those.

I like Shaq.

You know, I work with the police.

That's right.

How many people is Shaq arrested?

Got over there.

Let's see Shaq.

Well, he broke that backboard one time.

That's true.

I don't know if he's arrested anyone, but he smashed a bunch of backboards.

Wasn't he the guy who pulled over Tiger when he was on all those pills?

Tiger Woods.

Tiger Woods when he was driving on them pills.

I thought it was Shaq that arrested him.

Shaq pulled over and said, Bitch, get on the ground.

Is Tiger Woods the guy with the bleached hair?

Jesus, oh, beware.

No, that's- You think- You're thinking of Tiger King?

Oh.

You might be thinking of Tiger.

If you're thinking of a guy with bleached hair, you might be thinking of Tiger King.

Okay, I got three names.

I don't know.

This is the help.

Well, Guy Fieri.

He's- What?

Guy Fieri.

He is a man.

Guy Fieri.

Francesca, have you ever met Guy Fieri?

I mean- He is related to me.

You know he's Italian.

Oh, so everyone Italian is related to- Everybody Italian know each other.

Yeah, we're all cousins.

That's why we saw each other last at the family reunion.

We have to give each other free- Sam- It's an Italian culture thing.

If you meet- If you see someone that's also Italian, you have to give them a free sandwich.

Even if you don't work in a deli.

So you just carry loose sandwiches.

I mean, I was already.

I have a whole bag of- A whole little rolling- I got- I got Gaba Ghul.

I got SupaSad.

I got- I got fucking Przoot.

I got Gallamade.

What am I- What am I- What am I- What's Gallamade?

What's Gallamade?

I got balsamic.

I got a very age of balsamic.

Oh, I love it.

I got a Tempranillo that'll fucking rip your tits off stuff.

You might like it.

I really don't want my tits ripped off.

Thank you so much.

I'm waiting to try this Tempranillo.

Francesca, if I may- Yes, what?

I didn't want you- How are you going to achieve this?

Well, first of all, I have a whole team of people.

I take all the employees from Bed-Beth and Beyond.

And I get them to come to my training program where I either eyebrows, I put them in a big pants.

I need any shirts.

I teach them how to be kind of act like they never met you before.

Even if they have kind of give you cold shoulder in the green room kind of baby.

This just sounds like the way you normally are.

Is there a class what shows them how to like pretend like something's happening on the iPad in front of them?

Absolutely.

Yeah, because that's one of my favorites.

It's like, I can see that there's nobody sitting anywhere in the restaurant.

But you're really swiping through a bunch of things on the POS.

Like, you know something.

Exactly.

So when people come to Bed-Beth and Beyond, it's like, excuse me, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Hang on a minute.

Let me see if we have anything available for you to say that.

So invisible behind you is- The whole star.

Unreal amount of towels.

So many towels.

Literally all towels full of hair.

I like towels.

And now I think I'm doing a pretty good job.

I know it.

I also like towels for what it's worth.

I use it for waterboarding if you remember.

Oh, that's right.

And then you say, I can get you in and about 55 to an hour and a half.

Shit.

Is this working?

I mean- It's a working, so what?

Do you give us one of those little buzzy things that we put in our pocket?

We wait in the pocket a lot to the buzzers.

No, that is a little too tacky for me.

Instead of what it is, is you have to come and you have to check in with the host periodically.

Maybe 55 minutes later.

I have to be serious about the people sliding and get tables pretty quickly.

Exactly.

Some of them are famous.

And do they get increasingly angry every time you check in?

Absolutely.

Yeah.

But they get very passive aggressive like this.

They be like, Oh, let me check.

That was really good.

That was so good.

Yeah.

Okay.

So it's still going to be like 35 to 45 minutes.

30.

That's too long.

That's way too long.

To get into bed, bath, and beyond?

I don't see how this can work.

Hey, look, I'm sorry.

Like it's not me.

It's just like our policy, but you can go sit on the ground.

Do we have to vape out there?

Seems like everyone's waiting has to vape for some reason.

Yeah, you do.

I mean, if you want to get in.

Yeah.

I'm just trying to run.

I just want you to run it real quick by a simple human step trash can.

Can I please just go in there and do that?

No, I'm so, so.

I know exactly what I want.

I know exactly where it is.

I know.

Oh, excuse me.

Yeah.

No, sorry.

Yeah, no.

Excuse me.

I work in law enforcement.

I should be able to get a table.

Yeah, we love cops.

Okay.

I can go in.

When you say get a table, you mean buy a table.

Oh, yeah.

I need to buy a fucking kitchen table.

We don't sell tables anymore, but we do sell.

You can get a bed table, a bath table, but no kitchen table.

Yeah, we do have bath tables, big bath tables.

Anyway, you get what I mean.

Like look how effective you get into the store.

Oh, please let me get in.

I heard you Scott.

Oh, please have to eat the shit.

I'm taking anyone.

Oh, I want to eat the shit.

All right.

You doing incredible American exit, by the way.

Thank you so much.

Has he ever asked you if there's any head tie at Bed Bath to be on?

Oh my god.

Every fucking day.

He seems like the type.

He called me.

He called the store.

How did you guys have an entire yet?

No, we don't sell fucking hand-eye.

French guys, I guess I'm just upset because this is the holiday episode.

You did not bring me any Christmas gift of hand-eye.

Oh, but no, but I did bring you a gift because I knew you were dying.

I am not dying, but what did you bring me?

I bring you.

These are big piece of cheese.

This is not that big of a big, I mean, maybe 10% bigger than that.

For the Petorino Romano, that's a pretty big fucking piece, brother.

You know how much it cost me?

How, what, a dollar?

Three dollars.

Oh, okay. Well, thank you.

A's.

Three times the amount you thought it cost.

Three dollars.

All right.

What?

You're, man, you're so close.

You're lucky.

I get wheelier.

I get wheelier in the big thing of Parmesanore John, no?

By my cousin, Menacotti, and I cut you a tiny little sleeper of my bed.

For the sleep.

Okay.

I appreciate that.

I really don't want to be eating anything that you're sleeping in though.

I have to say.

You are.

It's already in your mouth.

Scott's not interested in eating anything.

Okay.

Yeah.

So as established earlier in the podcast.

I'm talking about pussy.

Well, Francesca, I good luck to you during the holidays.

I don't know whether this.

Good luck to you.

I can dig it.

I'm praying for you.

I'll talk about pussy.

Shut your mouth.

And don't dig it, please.

You're going to pray for me?

Is that what you said?

I'm praying for you.

You don't need to pray for me.

I'm going to be fine.

You're going to be kidding.

Pussy, it would give you a live longer.

You're going to get Michael Douglas and heal this throat cancer.

I've been alive as long as I've been alive.

So it's keeping me alive as a live.

I've been alive.

You've never heard of that, right?

I'm laying traps now, which.

Is that Michael Douglas?

Was it tongue cancer?

Is that what you're going to say?

What?

Never mind.

Well, we need to take a break if that's okay.

Oh, fucking God.

Yes.

We're going to see what that peanut butter crotch out front is all about.

Okay.

Not if I don't get to it first.

Oh, may the best man win?

Sure.

You can use a male.

When we come back, we'll have some exciting guests coming up.

I have no idea who they are, but is anyone, you can all stick around, right?

Nope.

Oh, I'll be wrong too bad.

I'm bad enough.

Oh, really?

So if I...

Yeah.

You know, we...

The air's not so good to hear anybody.

We need to repair our relationship.

Okay, I love you.

Okay, I love you too.

I love you too.

Oh, I love you too.

I'm just not interested.

I love you so much.

All right, we're going to take a break.

We'll be right back with more comedy, baby.

After this.

Comedy, bang, bang.

We're back.

Unfortunately, Obi, or fortunately, Obi Ron Kenobi had to leave.

We did patch it up though.

We told each other we loved each other.

We're crying out there.

We...

It was very emotional.

I have to say, the holidays, a lot of emotions just get stirred up and you don't, you know, I mean, sometimes families fight.

You damn right, Scott.

That's true.

I mean, you have a family, don't you?

You must come from a big litter.

I've got a bunch of brothers and sisters, a bunch of kids.

A bunch of kids, really.

Yeah, of course, like we've talked about this before.

I've been on Morrie many times.

That's right.

On his leg.

I'm on his leg.

On his TV show.

Oh, well, hey, nice doggy, but I've got some paternity results.

And then he says, you are the father.

I do a dance anyway, so I'm going to go out.

You got it.

If you got the dance in the chamber, you got it.

You got it.

Pulled the trigger on it.

I'm pissed.

You know, when Gina was leaving, he...

Yeah, Gina had to go too.

Yeah.

You beat me to the...

Francesca is still here.

Yay.

We're all happy about it.

Scott, you've missed me so much.

Did you miss me during the break?

I don't miss my guests, but yes, I've missed.

You've been like, oh, where are you, she...

Oh, I'm so hungry for shit.

Okay.

It might be easier if you just talk to that American accent.

You were doing it so much easier to understand.

Um, I'm sorry.

We actually...

I can't keep it up that long.

That's so good.

It's really good.

That's slipping back into my...

Oh man, yeah, you lost it right there.

Yeah, you can't lose it.

Yeah.

Um, we have to get to our next guest.

Uh, are you a sports fan, McGruff?

I love sports.

Francesca?

I love a sport.

What's your favorite sport?

I like volleyball.

Okay, well, you're going to be very disappointed.

I like the Georgia Bulldogs.

Because they're dogs.

Yeah, it's a bitch.

Okay, well...

I like watching the very tall women hit them all so hard at each other.

Boom, boom, bang, bang.

Tiddies flying.

Right, yeah, tiddies flying.

Well, true sports fan.

Tiddies sometimes fly with our next guest.

He is a basketball legend.

And he is currently one of the co-hosts of a TNT halftime show.

Inside the NBA.

Please welcome to the show Charles Barkley.

Scott, what the hell you got me in?

What does it smell like dog in here?

Oh, wow.

Sorry, this is McGruff the crime dog.

Every time I'm around white people, it smells like dog.

Sorry, I am a dog.

What is this?

The McGruff is a cartoon dog though.

So it shouldn't smell or you should smell more like an animation cell.

Yeah, that's right.

Like a paper and fucking ink.

Marking pens.

Also, Scott to give everybody a little bag of shit to win me guinea hair.

I was wondering, when I was coming in the Postmates guy was with me.

I said, why was there a fool that you're carrying smell like shit?

Who's ordering that?

He said, I got an order for Scott.

I said, I don't know no Scott.

Hey, Scott, that was your name.

Yeah, it'd be nice to Scott.

He is dying.

We've started your dying?

I'm not dying.

Damn, I wanted to kill you.

Have we ever met before Charles?

I don't think we have ever.

Scott, we met one time in Phoenix in 1994 and we went out to Ruth's Chris steakhouse.

I don't remember this 1994.

You got the lobster and I got a well done Porter house.

I think I would have remembered.

We shared it.

We both we split.

What's it called when you bite both ears?

What's the movie?

Lady in the trailer.

Lady, he talked about it earlier.

Who did that to Lady?

I did.

You did that to Lady in the trailer.

I don't want to get into the details, but I put the spaghetti in a vagina and I ate to it.

There was hardly details.

Oh, sorry.

I've done that many times in my life.

It's a invigorating experience.

Scott, what the hell is this?

It's a I don't even know how to describe it.

It's a podcast, which is like radio, but for more tech savvy area.

I sound stupid even.

Scott, you sound stupid.

Don't say that.

Charles, it's a damn B.A. season is underway.

What's going on right now?

How are you feeling about the season?

I can't stand it.

You hate basketball.

I hate it.

You hate basketball?

There's players.

Nobody good enough anymore.

Ain't nobody good enough and all these people running around saying stuff about the Jews.

And I don't know what's going on.

I mean, that's really only one player.

That's really one player.

Everybody in the league is always talking about the Jews.

Okay, this is news because we've only heard about the one guy.

And I can't believe it.

Idiots.

Scott, what the hell is this?

It's vodka.

I'm sorry.

This is like the show you do.

Scott, you like to have people on that hate him and we scream at him.

And then somehow he feels satisfied at the end.

Scott, that's some horny shit right there.

That's a kink.

Scott's kink is having people insult him.

It's a very kinky stuff for him.

The only way he gets off.

Only way he gets off.

Scott takes out that mangled dick.

Tingle, Charles, we've just met.

You're gonna fit in just great, Charles.

Charles, isn't the All-Star game on Christmas or something?

No.

Well, then I don't know what to add.

I'm close.

That doesn't know anything about the basketball.

I know about basketball though.

Yes.

You tell me what it means when somebody do a front slide back switch.

Oh, I'll tell you exactly what that means.

It's like somebody's been living with a basketball lover.

A front side black, a front side.

Tell us about that too.

A front side black switch?

It's a front side black switch and a front side back switch.

Front side back switch, something is traveled.

And a front side black switch is the electric slide on the board.

Wherever it breaks out.

I know about that.

Cook out.

Dog.

You've done the electric slide, dog.

What you got on this long overcoat?

I do the cha-cha slide, electric slide.

I do all the slides.

Look at your errors.

Your errors are so floppy.

They flopping around.

Unless something happens where I need to hear it and they go, look, they come right on up.

Who let this dog be a police?

I don't know.

How do you feel about the police, Charles?

Me?

Yeah.

I love the police.

I'm back to blue.

How do you feel about the canine unit?

It's weird, right?

It's weird.

Given dog's badges?

You know what?

I respect all police.

I'm back to blue and I'm back to wolf.

Good to know.

Basketball, the most orange ball in sports.

The most orange?

Is that right?

That's a good question.

Get everything back on track.

Me and a huddle fame and he's asking me what the most orange ball in sports.

What do you want me to ask you to do?

I have a question for you.

Please.

What does it mean when somebody do a jump shot back holding?

A jump shot back holding.

Right.

Is when you mix basketball and football together.

I would like to see that.

That's actually a sport I would watch.

Scott, you're so kinky.

You're very kinky.

Do you like when people yell at you?

I actually am not enjoying it.

Charles, what do you do for the holidays?

Okay, here's what I like to do.

I like to stick four turkeys in my big old oven.

Oh, how big is your oven?

Huge.

I have to stick one giant turkey in your oven instead of four.

Well, you find me a giant turkey, Scott, and I'll cook you.

But as of now, I stick four big old turkeys in my oven and I cook them up.

I brine them.

I inject them with lemon butter.

Lemon butter.

Yeah.

You brine them while they are cooking in the oven.

Yeah, I don't brine them before.

I don't brine them before.

And I cook them for 24 hours.

Low and slow.

That's too low.

That's too slow.

So they're straight up like it's foggy.

You can't take them out.

It's just like a white mess.

I could come on 75.

The bones and everything just melt into a big turkey soup.

Yeah, so it's delicious.

My whole family loves it.

Scott, you should come over this year.

Everybody's invited.

Except you dog.

You got to eat outside.

Hey, I understand.

What can I say?

Well, it's wonderful to see you at Christmas, even though you and I have never met.

I have a feeling you're going to go.

Scott, why do you keep forgetting about the time in 1988 in Philadelphia?

Well, we were in the Liberty Bell together.

We were chased by the car.

I sort of remember that.

Yeah.

We were chased by the cops.

I said, catch me.

I backed the blue.

Now, Charles, I got something for you.

Please.

I know recently there was some controversy where you were describing the women at the San Antonio Arena.

Oh, man, are they fat?

No, no, no.

I think we didn't want to re-get back.

I didn't want to get back into it, but I was hoping to give you an opportunity to maybe apologize.

I'd like to apologize to the chairs that they said it.

Oh, no. Come on, Charles.

This ain't right.

This is what you told me to say.

Yes, I'm looking at your script and I gave him something.

I said, okay.

You gave me a list of talking points.

Maybe I wrote some jokes for you.

I have a question for you.

Will you eat the pussy?

Me.

Yeah, recently, Steven asked this question.

He was very embarrassed.

First of all, that's private.

Number two.

Yes.

I brined it for 24 hours.

Slow, slow.

You add the salt water.

Well, you know.

The salt water and the living butter.

It sounds like it's steamed so bad.

You ever have a guy eat a taco dinner?

Finger you?

It's a fucking bird.

A taco dinner like off the truck.

What are you crying to go to the hospital?

He's like, did you like it?

No, I didn't fucking like it.

He's burning me.

You're going to add that to your stand up, Frances.

Thank you, man.

That's a good change.

Most of my jokes are like this.

My teeth.

My teeth so much.

Oh, you're talking about volleyball?

Gosh, you like volleyball?

I love volleyball.

I love it.

They're tall women hitting the ball at each other and then titties bouncing.

They bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.

Bounce, bounce, bounce.

The balls go bouncing, titties go bounce.

Are there short volleyball players?

I've always wanted them.

Short volleyball players.

I don't want to ask that.

Oh, wow.

There should be legal.

There should be, you know, a different leagues based on height.

Well, yeah, I could play.

I would be very good.

Yeah.

The one foot to two foot league.

But I can't get my serve over the net.

Oh, they would lower the net.

Oh, no.

We play on like a pickleball court net.

Even a little lower.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

I would love that.

Yeah, that would be fun.

I could compete.

You could be my coach.

I would like that.

Wow.

Being in a position of power over you.

It's weird when we agree.

Yeah, it is.

It makes me feel a little strange.

I'm going to try to do that.

Anything you say I'm going to agree.

But nevermind.

Charles, we need to bring on our next guest.

Okay.

And someone who's maybe more famous than you.

Impossible.

I think it might be the case.

Who would you say are the people in the world who are more famous than you?

Listen.

Right.

Charles Barkley.

Right.

You just listed yourself twice.

Comrade Murray.

Dr. Death.

And Dr. Oz.

All right.

Who I voted for.

She's got, I know that's not true.

Because famously, Charles Barkley, what's at the UCB theater, Toby?

He doesn't vote.

He's a vote who cares about you.

That was before Dr. Oz was on the ballot.

Oh, okay.

First time you ever voted.

I have to vote for Dr. Oz.

He's doing good things in the world.

I agree.

I like a doctor.

Telling those women in San Antonio, I lose weight.

This is what you put on the list.

I just, I apologize.

I highlighted in everything.

We need to get to our next guest.

We've talked to him once before.

I believe it.

I don't remember where it was, but one of the most famous people in the world.

Pop superstar Harry Styles.

Hey.

Oh, hi.

Oh, God, you look lovely.

You look lovely.

Oh, look at you.

You look lovely.

Wow.

Oh, God.

Yeah.

Everything in here.

What about the dog?

What about the carpenter dog?

Oh, beautiful dog.

Beautiful dog.

Thank you.

Beautiful dog.

Two and a quarter of your dimensions.

Oh, yeah.

Look at you.

Thank you.

Look at you.

Turn to the side.

Turn to the side of the graph.

Let me put my little tail up.

Oh, come on then.

Yes.

Great.

He turned to the side and disappeared.

Does anybody else feel like we've got a glitter filter on this room?

There's something so magical.

So sparkly.

It's all of you.

I like this guy.

He's changing the energy completely in here.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, for sure.

He's for sure in the pussy.

I know it.

Oh, yeah.

Dining on it.

Buff-faced style.

Home town buffet style.

Oh, just buffet style style.

Oh, meaning a bunch of different pussies?

Just no, just multiple rounds.

Of eating one thing.

Yeah, well, could be.

That's not why I go to it.

There's salad pussy.

There's main course pussy.

That's dessert pussy.

And dessert round, of course.

Is anybody always take the guy so long to find what the main course?

I'm not in my experience.

Yeah, I leave that at your standard.

But you don't think that's good?

I think that's that's like.

Now, here, yeah.

I saw that you were just in a movie called The Policeman.

Yeah, yeah.

I'm trying movies.

Yeah, well.

Not the right time.

Like, especially since you must have filmed that in 2020.

Yeah, well, you know, I'm just sort of the thing about me and acting is I just thought I'd sort of, you know, walk on through.

Yeah.

Didn't really go well.

No, no, that's all right.

We're not all brilliant at everything.

Oh, we Scott.

I just thought I'd walk on through.

You tried two things.

Two movies.

No, no, I mean, singing and acting.

You've tried two things.

Yeah.

You're really bad at what?

Well, no.

Three things.

What's the third?

Singing, acting, and nail polish.

Okay.

I would say Harry's house.

Well, undesired, design Harry's house.

Oh, you have your own business.

I didn't know.

Yeah, yeah, Harry's house.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, we had a little pop up.

Oh, all right.

How were the sales?

Great.

Brilliant, beautiful.

Yeah.

How's the, what's the quality of the nail polish?

Excellent.

Doesn't chip better than a gel.

Yeah.

Charles, Charles, would you try nail polish?

Hell yeah.

I put nails all over my nails.

Now hold on, what?

Love that.

You love that.

Yeah.

I could see like a, like a topi sage on you.

I could see like- A topi sage.

I could also see- This is a candy apple red.

You got it.

Yeah.

Sexy.

You come here.

You can, can we touch noses?

Who is this boy?

This is, do you know one direction?

Who?

Which way are they going?

I guess I have no other way to describe it.

Do you know any direction?

Any direction up.

Works.

I like it.

No, I'm not- In San Antonio, around.

Okay, I'm just saying what you told me to say.

I'm so, I'm so jealous that this man got jokes, Scott.

I'm sorry, I didn't fax your jokes over.

So right, I don't like them.

Jokes that make me nervous.

I prefer to just, you know, be sincere and look people in the eye.

Can we touch noses?

I don't feel like you're being sincere.

Why is that?

Scott, do you want to touch noses?

No, this feels like this is all in that.

What do you actually like?

Everything.

I don't think so.

Well, here's the thing, Scott.

I like everything a little bit.

Yeah.

Can we touch noses?

No, I don't want to touch noses.

Okay, can I touch your nose with my finger?

You touch my nose with your finger.

Just a little boop.

Okay, yeah.

Okay, ready?

Three, two, one.

Boop.

That wasn't your finger.

It was my nose.

It was my cheeky nose.

Oh my God.

What the hell is going on here?

Sorry, Charles.

Mr. Vargley, I'm just here to say that you are a beautiful man and I, there's something about your height that's so majestic.

Six, four.

Yeah.

Absolutely.

I'm just saying it's for a powerful way.

Yeah.

Have you ever considered a high-waisted pant?

A high-waisted pant.

I can't get that above my stomach.

Let's get some trousers on you, mate.

No pants are way too tight.

Maybe a little double-breasted sort of...

Double-breasted pant?

No, no, a little jacket on top.

A small, small jacket.

You know, like a hostess.

I like to see a double-breasted jacket.

Exactly.

A very, very, very big a panther.

Yes, big shoes.

Big, big shoes.

A tiny jacket.

Dang, you need to do that.

Yes, you get it, love, don't you?

I usually travel to the opposite, right?

Like giant shoulder pad jacket.

That's what I like to wear.

Yeah.

Oh, your last name is Barkley.

Barkley, yes.

And you're an underdog?

And there's a dog here.

Hell no.

They're no damn dirty dog.

All right.

This is a...

You know, this is a...

Harry, I see you have a French mannequier.

Wow.

Very cool that you play with your sexuality like that.

I love it.

I think he's pandering.

Yeah.

And you know what?

I love that.

You know what I love the most about that?

Is that it sparks a conversation, right?

It's a dialogue.

And ultimately, just like more, right?

Harry, you've been on the show twice.

Yeah.

And you have not said anything of substance the entire time.

Yeah.

But...

Or you're just like...

You have nothing in your brain.

I'm a vase.

You're a vase.

What does that mean?

Yeah, like...

We have to force up...

I'm a vessel.

Yeah.

I let everybody else put it in me.

But you know what?

A vase.

What the hell is going on?

I'm just...

Don't we all need...

Put it away.

Sorry. Sorry.

I'll put it away.

Don't we all need vases?

Put it back in the trench.

I mean, don't we all need vases in this world, Scott?

Don't we need little things to hold little buds, little flowers?

Little bugs?

Little toads.

Towels.

You put little towels.

You put a...

Talking about a towel rack.

You put a bunch of towels in a bath.

A bath.

Yeah.

Thank you.

So you like Harry.

I love Harry style.

I'm obsessed with him.

Like you and...

Do you like his music or his personality?

I like that he model on the catalog.

Wear the big pants.

Big pants.

Do you like shoes, Tony jacket?

I like that he make me do his accent when I talk to him.

It's just a very merry Harry, isn't it?

It's just a little bit of this tease.

Mys in love.

Fun.

And like, yeah, what else?

Yeah, come on.

Yeah.

And what about if I...

Hey, what if I...

Do you know, Scott, you know that the lighting changed when I look at you?

No, really?

Absolutely.

What do you work?

When I work, I work...

She's a social media expert.

I work at the bathroom beyond.

Yeah, you do.

And what's beyond for you, love?

I don't know.

I love you, Kevin.

No, that's right.

No, no, me.

And I will and I'll love it.

Well, I bet this guy is drowning in it.

No.

Wait, you haven't had a taco meal?

Have you?

No, no, never.

Never put anything with spice on the digits.

Have you ever had sex?

Have I ever had sex?

Yes.

No, I only give it love.

You give sex.

Yeah, I only give it.

Yeah.

Interesting.

It's the time of the year.

It's till the season, right?

It's the time of year to give.

Do you give McGruff?

Of course, I give my all to the police.

Oh, no, Bob, that man.

I don't know.

All right, what do you do for the holidays, Harry?

Because that's the question I've been asking every one of the guests on the show.

Yeah, so I sort of like it.

Thank you, McGruff.

Yeah.

Appreciate it.

Take it up the slide.

I like to go back to all my own teachers and give them big, big thank you baskets and then make the houses look like snow globes.

Harry, I can't tell if you're right.

The least interesting person in the world are just a total scumbag.

Yeah, so I know.

I just don't like, I don't like the whole facade.

Why do you get so nervous around me?

I'm not nervous.

I just, I want you to be real.

I am being real.

I'm not being real.

Do you think a little?

Oh, I just want you to be yourself.

I am myself, Scott, always.

Look it, let's everybody strut around the room.

Strut.

No, no, I just strut around the room.

You're strut, I strut the video.

Yes, ah, ah, ah, yeah.

As I'll say, the young hot lady wanted to strut and let that be a lesson, you know?

Who?

I'm just a couple of them.

He's only young.

The beautiful one over here.

The one foot tall.

Oh, I'm sorry, you probably haven't even seen her.

It's been tough, I've been hearing a voice.

I've been asking questions all time.

Yeah, and I've been answering them.

I can't see nobody.

I just woke up.

Oh, sorry, were you?

Sorry, Charles.

You were napping during that last segment.

Oh, no, I was napping before I came and did it.

Oh, I said, oh, I'm so sorry to wake you up.

I didn't.

You gave me one to show, yeah.

I didn't wipe the sleep out of my eye.

Well, Harry, are you up to anything?

I mean, your, your, your tour is just wrapping up.

Love on tour.

Do you know, my favorite thing about love on tour is posting little photos of me the day after where I look like a little deer.

Yeah, that's your favorite thing.

What about?

Yeah, my favorite thing.

I've seen the beautiful fans, of course, Scott.

Of course, seen them come out from all over.

But what about the love of the music and the art that you're creating, or is it just, does that not have any connections to your world?

Oh, the music, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

But do you even like your songs?

Oh, yeah, sure.

Music for a sushi restaurant.

Scott.

Where else would you listen to at a sushi restaurant before me?

Brode a song.

Music for a sushi restaurant.

And what I love about that tune is that I say what it is.

Right, yeah.

I guess it is a genre that needs songs, you know?

I like my fish fried.

I gotta agree.

Yeah, why don't you try a tempura mate?

Have a little bit of a, like a gateway over to the beautiful sushi, a delicate tune.

Tempura.

A beautiful yellowtail, yeah, a beautiful uni.

Scott, do you remember that time in 1983?

And I was playing basketball at Auburn University, and you came down and watched me play.

I mean, we went, uh, I definitely don't remember.

No, we did.

Scott, I forget all these times we met each other.

Yeah, I don't remember any of that.

His memories go up.

You guys, let's take a minute to give Scott the prayer.

His thigh.

I'm not dying.

Everything's all right.

Scott, do you want me to sing over you?

I am.

Music for a sushi restaurant.

I mean, here's what I'm thinking.

Look, I feel like we have no idea who the fuck you are in real life.

Sure.

Someone's gonna need to just like interrogate you.

We're gonna find a new layer.

You need to be water-boarded.

We need to water.

We need to water- You get me in a room with gruff, and you're gonna see the realty, and I promise you it's just this.

I promise you all the way down it's big.

Okay, water-boarding.

Okay, here we go.

I'm putting the towel in the head.

And then I know.

I love this.

Music for a sushi restaurant.

I'm very blue.

Music for a sushi restaurant.

Oh, I miss Nile.

Okay, nothing's different.

Nothing's different.

Nothing.

And I think that's like- He's got nothing.

Scary of this.

Yeah.

He's got nothing inside of it.

The fact that there's nothing- I'm a boss.

I'm a boss.

No, you're just empty.

He's a visor for the towel.

All right, well, Harry, it's great to have you here.

Can you stick around?

Of course, Scott.

We need to get to our next guest.

He's an artist.

Oh, beautiful, lovely.

Oh, yeah, this.

I can see it right now.

Yeah, he's a young adult novelist.

He's never been on the show before.

I like Charles here.

New friend.

We've known each other for 50 years.

It'll be about 10 years.

Please welcome to the show for the first time, Henry.

Hey, let me just apologize right off the bat, Scott.

For what?

Just for rolling in here with my scarf and my sunglasses and my hat and my big old coat.

Don't worry about it.

I'm just a little chilly.

Look a little like McGruff over here with the big old- Yeah, I kind of do.

Yeah, so I just want to apologize for rolling in here.

No, you do.

I don't get a little weird, so I'm sorry.

You're not looking weird.

Well, I just don't want to seem closed off, because I am open as all get out.

OK.

I am an open book.

No secrets.

Yeah, beautiful.

I'm a young adult novelist.

I'm just here to promote my holiday themed work that's coming out and then let you guys get back to your business.

OK, well, it's your segment.

You...

I'm almost done.

You're a young adult novelist.

Young adult novelist.

I mean, I'm not a young adult.

I'm a full- I was wondering, because that's what I expected.

And when you walked in here, I was like, oh, this guy is like 50.

Oh, yeah.

Between 50 and 60.

OK, yeah.

Unfortunately, you're dead, right?

But yeah, I write novels meant for the young adult market, the YA market.

Wow.

It's not.

How does an older gentleman get interested in writing things for kids?

You know, I mean...

Yeah, yeah.

I think that the genre has evolved, even though it's called the young adult market.

A lot of adults actually enjoy YA novels, and it's just sort of shorthand for genre fiction.

Oh, OK.

Short sort of action-oriented, not a lot of internal landscape stuff.

Just let's get to the fun stuff.

So...

OK.

And actually, a lot of the characters in my books are full-grown adults.

So I'm not even sure of what I'm writing as technically YA.

OK, well, tell us about your...

Thank you so much.

My book that it's coming out, it's called Santa Runs Amaze.

It's a maze runner.

Santa Runs Amaze.

Santa Claus is in a dystopian future where in order to survive, he must successfully run Amaze faster than a lot of other full-grown adults.

And he fails faster than...

And they're all competing.

They're all competing contestants.

Or there's a team that's competing together.

Well, there's a team.

Like a relay.

And again, Santa.

No, there's a team and Santa's on the relay, and he's the runt of the team, and they hate him.

Oh, OK.

Because they're like, you're a fat old man, there's no way you're going to be getting a...

Does Santa have magic powers, though?

Can't he?

Couldn't...

I mean, he gets around the world.

Yeah, but he's hiding them.

In one night.

Because the government executes anybody with magic.

Oh...

So he can't reveal.

How do...

Why did they arrest him then, if...

Jaywalking.

Yeah, and Frank's...

He's an arrestable defense.

He wanted...

Thank you.

Your name...

Your criminalized it.

My name's McGruff the crime dog.

OK.

I don't know why that's hard for you to...

What?

Let's start with that.

I don't know.

Just the crime dog.

It's just fun to walk around saying what you are.

Oh, no, man.

I'll be like, I'm Henry the YA novelist.

That's how I introduce you.

That's what you wanted me to say.

Sure, on a talk show it makes sense.

But just in conversation with...

Yeah, I'm on a talk show right now.

Hey, what's important?

Don't worry about it.

Mate, Harry Styles.

Harry Styles.

Raz and baby deer.

Um, I wanted to know what happened to all the presents.

Sorry.

What happened to all the presents, man?

Yes, Santa is running a maze.

What happened to all the presents?

They stopped and nobody knows why.

I know, that's terrible.

Because we've been doing him in secret.

Nobody knew that it was Santa...

There's no presents on Christmas Day.

I see, no presents are delivered on Christmas Day.

No presents are delivered because Santa's not there.

Do what he's busy trapped in the...

How long does it...

What day of the year does this occur on?

Weirdly March 1st.

March 1st.

Oh, OK, so it's such a good day.

Well, it's in the future.

Christmas has been shifted.

Like, it's an alternate world.

Oh, OK.

Science fiction.

So the main character of this young adult novel is Santa Claus.

One of the oldest...

No.

Okay, okay, okay.

It's called Santa Runs a Maze.

You don't meet him until about 200 or 300 pages in.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

It seems like if I were buying a book called Santa Runs a Maze, I want him running that maze on page 10.

That's why you're an amateur and I'm a professional.

Okay, you're right.

You got a...

You got...

That's bait.

I'm luring the reader in.

So who's the main character?

The main character is a young girl named Sally.

She's a 12-year-old.

She builds the maze.

She's a genius architect.

Does she build the maze in order to torture the people who are running the maze?

She is employed by the government kind of against her wishes to build mazes to torture people.

I see.

Does she know it's real?

Or is it like...

What's that other one?

You know...

What's that other one?

The Matrix?

No, no, no, no.

Enders game?

Divergent.

Enders game.

No, that's where the kid is doing what he thinks is a game, but he's actually...

Doing wall.

Doing military stuff.

He's doing wall.

No, she's...

She...

Yeah, that's what they say.

Yeah.

Have you seen Goodfellas?

That's kind of what you're talking about, right?

Your Charles Broccoli, right?

The best one there?

Yeah, that's right.

Who are you?

Henry the YA novelist.

Oh, okay.

I'm an author.

And don't worry about my sunglasses, my scarf, my head, everything's great.

Nobody's worried.

No one...

Why are you wearing those if you feel you need to apologize for it?

I don't need to apologize for it, and I just wanted to make sure you guys are all right with it.

We're okay with it, but why put it on?

Very uncomfortable by it, actually.

Yeah, do you mind taking him off?

Okay, I'm an amoeba.

All right, what the fuck?

What the fuck?

I am a single-celled organism.

Holy shit.

Okay, and I have wheel-powered myself into huge size and into an authorship.

All right, you got it out of me.

That is insane.

I'm one cell.

All right, look here, I'll take up my sunglasses.

I'll take out my head.

Oh, cute.

I'm just gonna flop.

All right.

I got no eyes.

Wow.

All right, relax.

No, I still think you're beautiful.

Thank you.

All right.

Do you want to touch noses?

I'm so sorry.

You don't have a nose, but do you want to touch your nose to my mitochondria?

Okay, yeah.

Three, two, one.

Boop.

Have you ever seen a hollow man?

No.

Kevin Bacon?

Yeah.

This is what a guy gets to say.

Is that the invisible man would?

Yeah, that's what he reminds me of.

Well, but what can he take all the bandages off and stuff?

Yeah.

Yeah, just anybody with bandages.

What?

To what end did this happen?

Why you were in amoeba?

Thank you for asking.

I was in amoeba, and I was bored, frankly, Scott.

Amoeba's life is pretty limiting.

Right.

And I was like, you know what?

I'm going to pull myself up by my bootstraps.

I'm going to work hard and become a more complicated being.

And you know what?

It worked.

Because everybody's doing it.

I believed in myself.

Yeah.

I'm a huge fan of America.

I don't think my story could happen in another country.

We could not.

I agree.

And I will part myself into what I am now, which is a fully functional large amoeba who can write books.

Great book.

This is what you wanted to do.

This is what I wanted.

Grown up wanting to be a novelist or?

I wanted just to be a more capable creature.

More evolved creature.

Yeah.

Somebody who could move around the world and interact and do more things than what amoeba normally does.

OK.

I have to be honest.

This sounds like a better premise to a book than the whole center.

No.

I'm sticking to my thing.

It sucks.

No.

It's my fore.

I don't know.

I like the sad thing better than this.

No, no.

No.

You think we've gone backwards with this?

Yeah.

No.

Now I don't quite know what's going on.

I wasn't sure.

I'll be honest.

I wasn't sure whether to bring it up.

I think everybody's wrong.

I'm equally interested in how a big amoeba with a coat and scar.

Oh my god, Harry.

You know what?

I was.

Could have a butthole and a mouth that are maybe the same thing.

And also, I need to know, does Sally become friends with Santa?

Or can you not give it away?

Yeah, I hope.

Sally, Santa, Awakenes, and Sally with a book.

We're interested in the plot of this book.

That's fine with me.

In order to whip me and be about my own questions.

But I'll say that.

Well, let's do one thing.

What are you?

OK, well, do you think so?

All right.

So Sally becomes friends with Santa?

Sally.

Well, yes.

Santa, consent that Sally has a heroic nature inside of her.

Well, he knows.

Because he knows that she's good.

Yeah, yeah.

OK.

He's got the list.

Can I say?

I mean, I think it was.

An audio nice.

I think it was a really bad idea named the little girl Sally.

And then you also have a Santa.

You don't do it who has the name.

He has a special.

If you were writing it in final draft, especially if you really.

I tried to adapt it to his screenplay.

One of the main notes was, no characters have the same first initial.

And I was like, shut up.

Yeah.

Just reading it.

It's like, so.

Yeah.

It's like, I was talking about Santa.

And then, ooh, yeah.

That's right.

If me and Amoeba can keep track of it, I think you can keep track of it.

All right, Amoeba question.

Now, you've become this sort of fake man.

You've been going on dates.

I haven't been going on dates.

Yeah.

I've been going on two dates where I'm bundled up.

And then third day where I'd reveal that I'm an Amoeba.

How did that go?

They're never interested.

They go right back to whatever we were talking about before.

All right.

All right, back to the book.

OK.

Is Rudolph involved?

Rudolph is a character at all?

I normally don't like to give spoilers out when I'm doing press for my book.

But there is a late appearance from Rudolph.

Wow.

Like a Han Solo.

Charles.

Like a Han Solo.

No, I'm interested.

So you're a Rudolph fan, Charles?

Oh, a big Rudolph fan.

Rudolph's not even mentioned for the first 500 pages.

And then it's revealed that he's been a political prisoner and Sally and Santa break him out and save the world.

This is rich.

Henry, I have a question about- You frighten me.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

The close, are you going to kill me or kiss me?

No, no, no.

No, only kiss you and only if you want it.

Hello.

How can your body swerve around so much?

On your legs.

Eyes remain frozen in place.

Mavaz.

You're a what does that mean?

You can put anything in me.

Exactly.

Actually, if you need to be in me, you're welcome to.

You know, I could hold you.

Is that a sexual proposition?

What the hell is going on?

I just want to know if there's other characters- I can't have sex because then I'll split into two.

Oh, that was going to be a good question.

Yeah.

Okay.

Beautiful.

Okay, good.

I'm just just offering my services to be sort of a male form for you, if you like it.

Wait, are you trying to say you want to act in the movie version of this?

I don't think- I don't think anyone wants that.

I can walk on through another movie.

I'm not driving around.

I don't think I'm driving around.

I don't think so.

I'd love to have you as Santa Claus in this movie.

Yeah, I knew it.

Your Santa will get out of the maze.

How's that?

Terrible.

It's pretty good.

Terrible.

It was very sexy.

Yeah, I knew it.

Hello.

All right, am I a boo question?

All right.

So you're pretty fucking smart for a single cell.

Oh, thank you so much.

Have you checked to see if you're not more cells at this point?

Because I feel like you have.

Yep.

I go twice a year to the doctor because I'm hoping.

I'd love to have more than one cell.

That's a goal for me as to become a multi-cell your organism.

But nope, still one cell.

Second part of the question, can you choose?

Oh, second part.

This is a separate question.

No, I know.

It's the same question.

Can you choose?

If you tell me how that's the second part of the question, how many cells I have, I'll answer it.

All right, I have a question that's both- Otherwise, you got a way to turn.

Okay.

I have a book, anime.

As long as it's book, you're allowed to go.

All right.

Are there amoeba characters in this book?

Yes.

There's a- Yeah, I thought so.

There's a- There's a cup- There's a little 75 page digression where we zoom in- A little 75!

Zoom into the mind of an amoeba that is resting on the skin of Sally.

And because the amoeba's on her skin can tell that she's getting tense and uncertain in her role working for the government.

And that's how we know that she's about to turn rebellious.

These sounds a little creepy.

Like you want to be on the 12-year-old skin?

Is everybody who speaks in this room get accused of pedophilia at one point in their interview?

It's pretty hard to avoid, I gotta say.

Is pedophilia in the eye of the beholder or in the creepiness of what's being said?

Well, jump to the holiday episode.

If you smelt it, you dealt it.

Yeah, you smelt it, you dealt it, but pedophilia-style.

No, I don't think that it's creepy for anybody to like being on a- Can I ask a book question?

Yeah.

True.

Okay, so the government doesn't like anything with powers, but Santa has powers.

Are there- Is it like the Tooth Fairy is also there?

The Tooth Fairy's been executed, the Easter Bunny's been executed.

Holy shit.

Most of the other holiday mascots- This is a lot like the Garbage Pail Kids movie, isn't it?

They're all like- But the Garbage Pail Kids is the only movie I've seen.

What about Grimace?

They sound like- What about Grimace?

Charles is what are you about?

What is- Is this a book question or an amoeba question?

I love Grimace.

I don't want him to- Well, he has the mouth.

He has the mouth.

He's a full of shit.

He was- He's eating his little bag.

Charles, you- Wolf's son.

Son of eating in the middle of your question.

I did.

You literally- I didn't want all that shit to go to waste as a personal guy.

Bro, it's not that bad.

It's got to see what you're doing.

I like eating shit too, I'm a dog.

Don't let this dog in here.

Did you forget your question?

I don't know.

No, Grimace.

Grimace, is he in the book?

Yes.

Also, as an amoeba, are you sexually attracted to Grimace?

Ooh, Grimace.

Because Grimace looks amoeba-ish.

Grimace sort of looks like one big- Cell.

Animace looks like the women of San Antonio.

Okay, all right.

You read his ribs and he almost- We had almost- Strickland.

Well, I have to say, Henry, this is fascinating stuff, the book.

Yeah.

I think the book sucks.

I want to know more about you.

No, this is more time than I thought I'd have.

I appreciate it.

We do need to move on to our next guest.

That's totally all right.

But stick around if you can and put the clothes back on in the- Sure sure, I look a little better.

Yeah, I don't think- Okay, I would appreciate that.

Glasses had- Hang on, coat.

I'm ready.

Okay, great.

All right.

Well, let's get to our next guest.

She's been on the show before.

She's a teen foreman.

Please welcome to the show Susie Tumen.

Oh, hi, Skye.

Hi.

Thanks so much for having me back.

Good to see you.

Oh, man.

Hey, Francesca has to go or something.

She just like snuck out the- What's going on here?

I had to go make Permigiano Redjano.

My ride is all loaded up.

I had to thank you.

Okay, I understand.

All right.

You need me to say goodbye?

Yeah.

It's going to me.

It's custom- No, I don't miss- No, I'm not going to miss you.

I love you.

All right.

Hey, Francesca.

I love you.

Francesca, can I come and just eat some pussy?

Eat my pussy?

Yeah.

What?

Okay.

One day we'll- You're not allowed to ask guests if we could eat their pussies.

Everybody, everybody, go get people- Anymore than you know what's- That's the last time.

You know what's got- I'm out of here.

I know.

They might have my pussies covered in a spicy salsa.

We'll figure it out outside.

Skye, I'm going to go if you don't want me to talk about- Groff, no, it's Stickred.

Okay, you can ask Elise Womack.

Okay.

Hey, Susie.

How are you?

Oh, I'm doing pretty good.

Don't make it Susie.

She's a teen girl.

No, Braff.

No, it's okay.

You can ask me.

No, Susie, I got any questions for you.

What do you do for the holidays?

Oh, Game of Groff.

All right.

You didn't ask Meebow over there.

Yeah, but I was so fascinated about the ability.

I appreciate the Meebow question.

That's a great question.

Sorry, what was your name, McGruff?

Yeah.

That's a great question, McGruff.

Listen, if I'm being honest, by day, I'm just a sophomore at Big Town High School.

I'm trying to pass algebra and the treasure of my JV basketball team.

And, you know, just hanging out, trying to get my crush to notice me.

But- Who's your crush again?

We didn't we talk about him?

Oh, no, he's old news.

It's Jason now.

Jason, really?

Oh, and do you have class with Jason?

Yeah, I got three classes with Jason.

Not that he'd know.

So anyways, by later in the day, I'm a teen foreman of a non-union construction site.

Non-union construction site?

Yeah.

So you should go and say- So you should go and say- Yeah.

They basically these- You hire these people off the street, is that what it is?

Not off the street, off a Craigslist.

Oh, okay.

So, you know, it's just one of those things where we take sort of advantage of people really needing the work right now.

Right.

Do the union crews ever come by and try to bust down the site or- Oh, sometimes.

Don't worry, we got a way to deal with them.

What's that?

School is hard.

Oh, okay, okay.

That's what I really wanted to talk about.

It's Candy Graham time.

Oh, during the holidays?

She's Candy Graham time at the holidays, and it's just so hard.

I get these stressful.

Yeah.

It's very stressful.

Well, Candy Graham's again, that's where like you buy them and then someone has to go to one of the classes.

Just send them to your crush.

Oh, Angelica runs the Candy Graham table and she hates my guts.

Why?

That's a great question, because I fired her dad.

Oh, shit.

Yeah, he was getting too talky during the lunch break hour.

Understandable.

That's pretty brutal.

Yeah.

Yeah, it is, but you know, it's just business.

So, you know, it's just one of those things where I'm trying really hard.

I'm trying my best, and that's all I can do, you know?

Yeah, no, it is.

I mean, this is the tough time.

I disagree.

You can do better than your best.

You can be more than who you are.

Do you see?

Don't settle for the hand that you were dealt.

You can become another creature.

Or the hand you weren't dealt.

Yeah.

Don't settle for the hand you weren't dealt.

Well, I sort of do that too.

You know, I sort of become someone else.

Yeah, you strive above your station.

If you're bossing around a bunch of construction workers.

Yeah, thanks, Nubima.

Good for you.

Do they ever look at you?

I mean, you're a slight teenage girl.

Do they ever kind of gang up on you and say like, hey, you know, why are you our boss?

And they try to sometimes.

And I sort of make examples of some of them.

In what way?

Well, let's just say there's a couple of them in the foundation of the New Cincinnati Hospital.

Well, let's just say you just confessed to murder.

That sounds like a crime.

I winked so it doesn't count.

Oh, I like this girl.

That's true.

In the court of law, if you wink, you get off.

By the way, that was more of a blink.

Well, I'm working on it.

OK.

So I think they even talk on their lunch break?

That's fucked up.

Do you know how many candy grams I got this year?

Those two talking during the lunch break.

If I may.

That's a one time they candy talk.

If I may.

Harry, what are you doing?

Oh, I was just going to say, you know, it can be hard sometimes when you feel like you're not getting enough candy grams.

But my advice would always be make sure you're giving more candy grams than you receive.

Are you about to kill?

You're doing weird.

Thanks, Harry Styles.

I'm such a huge fan.

Oh, thank you.

Thank you.

It's just such an honor.

Music for a sushi restaurant.

You're a restaurant.

I love that one.

Thank you.

Of course you do.

Thank you.

It's my ringtone when I wake up.

Oh, that's lovely.

Thank you for starting today with Harry.

Music for a sushi restaurant.

That's my candy gram to you.

I'm actually working on a song.

Oh, I hear you.

I hear it.

You want to hear my song?

Of course.

Oh, my gosh.

Don't steal it, Harry.

I never would.

My co-lab.

Okay, ready?

Here we go.

I'm sorry.

I'm a little shy.

Is it right?

Okay.

I got lots of friends.

And with my crush, I want a swap spittle.

There's a bunch of guys buried in the foundation of a hospital.

Okay, hold on.

Hold on.

Wow.

Yeah.

You didn't believe Jerry's going to matter.

But it was a song, so I can't tell if it's a real crime.

Well, I'm just, I'm working on it for my creative.

If you sing something, is it not a confession?

Lyrics are not admissible in court anymore.

That's right.

Really?

Oh, that's right.

I read that.

Yeah, it's a work of art.

It's a work of art.

You can't say.

If you put into a book that the amoeba loves being on the skin of a girl that's too young for it, that doesn't mean anything.

Okay.

You guys brought it up.

Call it back to somebody else's thing.

Francesca's back.

Would you leave something here?

Yes.

My phone?

Behind you?

That she's screaring around the room.

Do you want us to call it, Francesca?

What's your number?

So where did I see a human smaller than me?

Do you want us to call it?

I think, uh, I think I have it somewhere.

You think you have it somewhere?

Well, we're all looking around.

She's only one foot tall.

She's got a tiny phone.

We're never going to find it.

Your phone is as big as you.

Okay, bye.

Bye.

Now little girl, I've got a question for you.

Yeah.

Now you spend a lot of time at work.

Do you think maybe if you weren't working so hard, you'd have more inroads with the kids at school?

Well, I don't spend so much time at work.

I make sure all the guys have five hours door to door.

Now what the hell does that mean?

I just make sure that by the time they go home and get and clock out at the construction site.

I'm calling Francesca's phone.

Oh, there we go.

Over sure.

They got to be back in five hours.

I give them a solid five hours.

It's a tiny turnaround.

That's not enough sleep.

That might be a bit of a risk for you, love.

You know, they might end up getting hurt on the job if they're not slept.

No, they're not going to get hurt because of that.

We're cutting a lot of the rebar with aluminum.

That's how they're going to get hurt for sure.

Geez, the Wii.

Listen, I got to confess something.

I did maybe the worst thing I've ever done in my life.

Worst than burying two people in a foundation?

Yeah.

What?

Worst than that.

I sent Justin a candy gram from Naveha his crush, but I said something really mean.

What?

Oh no, to make them mad at her.

Okay, hold on, Amoeba, you're freaking out.

I'm really good.

That's very low.

I said...

In Amoeba culture, you'd be exiled for that kind of thing.

Hold on, Amoeba culture.

Oh man, well, I said I think I just want to be friends and I actually think that Devin should have gotten the lead in Les Mis.

Oh no!

No, this is tricky.

What is Devin actually playing?

Yeah, there's a lot of lead.

You keep playing Gavrosh, which is sort of a shoot.

Oh shoot.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's a real demotion.

We can have the conversation about Javev versus Jean-Vaugev.

You didn't play 24601?

No, no, no, no, no.

He didn't get to do the confrontation.

Oh no.

He was really excited about it.

He didn't get to just jump off of the...

DS family reunion?

Okay, I love that move.

I'm talking about the play.

Oh, before the...

No, never seen it.

We were talking about plays, weren't we?

I understand.

I feel really bad about the candy room and I don't know how to get it off my conscience.

Well, Harry any advice?

I would say you're already there.

You know, you already spoke it into the world.

That's the first step and maybe, I don't know, just trying to have it inform you going forward.

You know, maybe give your crew another hour of sleep.

This is terrible advice.

Could I suggest something?

Okay, Amoeba.

Could we try role-playing where I'll be one of the construction workers you work with and you're telling me the problem?

Because maybe if you put yourself in the mindset of where you're an authority, see that you'll have an answer.

All right, and who are we?

Your other construction workers.

We're just construction workers.

Give us some variety.

Okay, yeah, so let's say Harry, you're on, you're churning the cement.

Scott, you're...

I don't want to work there.

I want to...

I can say you're an OSHA guy, like code inspections.

All right, it still is kind of like I'm working in the construction.

Okay, you want to have it?

Okay, you're a one-man band busker on the corner.

Okay, great.

This is perfect.

Like Burke from Mary Poppins?

Okay, okay.

Okay, and you're British too, Scott.

Okay, go.

You're a British one-man band.

Okay, perfect.

This is more fun now, Charles.

Who's Charles Broccoli?

Charles Broccoli, you're going to be an eccentric millionaire.

All right, he already is.

He's looking to an adopted child.

Am I British as well?

No.

How about, what if you're deep Canadian?

Deep Canadian?

All right, I can do that.

Canadian, look into an adopted child.

Am I British?

I'm sorry.

I just got to say your backstory is so rich.

You're so talented.

Oh, thank you so much.

And McGruff, you're...

Yeah, McGruff, you're going to be...

Let's say that you are a mayor who has been canceled for his tweets, and he's mad about it.

Okay, can I still be an animated dog?

You're still a two-dimensional dog.

Okay, great, great, great, great, great.

And I'm a construction worker.

And I'm still the foreman?

And you're just yourself, and you're looking for advice on this situation.

Okay, wonderful.

From these people?

That's right, because this is where you're an authority figure.

And so if you're in this situation, you might have the confidence to know what to do.

Okay, all right, we'll try it.

All right.

Hey, what's bothering you?

Shut the fuck up.

Are you making eye contact with me right now?

Well, no, I just...

Get back to work.

I'm sorry.

Your lunch breaks cut.

What?

Your fire.

Whoa, you're right, I do feel better.

Excuse me, man.

Bala tatarari di da bari.

That's the big thing.

Two shots to the forehead.

Oh, shit.

That's crazy.

I'm from Canada, eh?

Are there any children in here to be adopted?

Children to be adopted?

Yeah.

Huh, I am a teen foreman.

Yeah, I...

Do you have a mother and father?

No, I don't.

I just have an uncle.

He runs a sort of off-the-board scam modeling agency.

Wow.

Well, if you need a parent, I can be that for you, right?

And I could get all types of different...

Salt and pepper wings.

So wait, you're saying everyone's having to be both a foreman and a high school student?

I could just be one?

You could just be one thing.

I have a ton of money.

I'm a millionaire, right?

Wow.

Yes.

And I have a box full of ketchup chips and all dress chips and salt and pepper wings, eh?

Excuse me, I'm the cartoon mayor.

And I've got a question.

I don't quite know how to use Twitter.

How do I erase this tweet where I said Ezra Miller was right?

And I'm churning the cement!

I'm churning the cement!

This cement is me!

Churned by me!

Hey, I want my job back.

You know what?

I've come back here.

You can't fire me, right?

That wasn't...

Two shots to the...

Harry Styles might be the worst actor I've ever seen in my life.

I gave you this life of churn cement!

Churned cement!

Don't even worry, millionaire and Mr. Mayor.

The cement is mostly sand.

And you don't worry, darling.

Just like an angsty creature.

All right, scene.

Wow, that was amazing.

Oh man.

Did that solve everything for you?

I do feel a lot more confident.

I just don't know what I'm going to say to Justin when I see him.

Why don't you shoot him in the head?

Why don't you treat him like one of your employees?

Sort of scream at him and make sure I take away all of his break time.

Take charge.

Wow.

Ask him if he's seeing Lorenzo's oil.

I gotta say, it did feel really good to be loved for a second.

Bye-huh.

Someone.

You're being loved, you murdered all of us.

Yeah.

Just two people.

My bad.

Well, look, what's your name?

Susie Tuman.

We need to take a break.

Okay.

Can you stick around or?

Am I allowed to?

Yeah, you can.

Yeah, do you want to stick around?

Harry, what are you up to?

Being love.

All right.

I'm sorry, I asked.

I have to revert into blob shape just for a moment.

Okay, yeah, please do.

Yeah, recharge.

Charles, you're going to stick around.

I'm going to watch this dude turn into blob shape.

Think about San Antonio.

And McGruff, you're still here.

I'm chilling.

We have a couple more guests.

We're going to come right back.

We have more from the holiday episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

We'll be right back after this.

Comedy Bang Bang, we're back.

McGruff, the crime dog here.

I hear Scott.

You haven't asked me what I do during the holidays.

Scott, what do you do for the holidays?

This, of course, have all my best friends over.

I could have fucking guessed that.

Why'd you make the S?

Okay, sorry.

We also have Charles Barkley is here.

Scott, do you remember that one time?

No, I do not.

Harry Styles.

Hello.

Henry, the amoeba who has reef.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Hello.

He runs back into human shape.

That's correct.

In approximation of human shape.

In approximation, I'm still in amoeba.

Thank you.

Exactly.

We also have Susie Tumen over here, the team foreman.

Oh, man.

Oh, what happened during the break?

Justin just asked Naveyha to the winter ball.

No.

Before the candy gram arrived?

No, afterwards.

He said that he liked that she was being so mean to know.

Oh, no.

This is terrible.

Charles, any advice?

What is this Naveyha looks like?

That's a hot name.

Sounds native American.

Oh, Charles, you gotta be careful.

Sorry we went to you.

We need to get to our next guest.

He's a little boy who's been lost, I think, for a little while.

He's been on the show once before.

Please welcome back Dickey Dolly.

Oh, Scott, I love you.

I love you.

Scott, please let me be your little boy.

No, I know.

Sorry.

I'm not.

I'm not in the...

I don't want any more children.

But to me, Scott, I'm missing boy Dickey Dolly.

Floor full one, big hands, little heart, open belly, closed mouth, long toes, little teeth.

Open.

Dolly.

Open belly.

Yeah.

You want a knife fight?

Hi, Dickey.

It's wonderful to have you back on the show.

I'm sorry.

I can't adopt you.

No.

Fat, fat, low to good.

That did me, Scott.

Came on your show, found my parents, and they didn't come for me.

I'm sorry.

I think, didn't we sort of establish that you're like in your 20s now?

They've been, you've been gone so long.

It's a relevant Scott.

I'm out here on my own.

And after that episode hit the airwaves, well, all these perverts from Reddit came out trying to adopt me.

None of them are my parents.

I'm still in the lookout, missing boy.

You've seen the posters.

I've seen all the posters.

You've done me to put two big ideas, gust of wind, small feet, Dickey Dolly.

Dickey, I'm sorry.

There's nothing I can do for you.

I gave you the platform.

If your parents haven't heard it, what was the hell, it was like a helicopter situation?

What was it?

Oh, I fell off and upside down, loop on a roller coaster into an open jam sport backpack, got ticketed to a helicopter, fell out of that, plopped into the ocean and then lived in the trees with a bunch of other kids.

That's right.

You're just sandwich, chicken, feet, Marcus, rainbows, marble dickhead.

All great friends to you, I'm sure.

And who was it that kidnapped you originally?

Trent, Don't be, don't make me say his name.

I'm sorry, he has not reached out to you, has he, since the show?

Well, I hope not.

See, the thing is, after that episode came out, all those people came to apply for adoption for me through the IRS.

And somebody came and got me.

This is the right...

And he said he was Santa Claus, but now I was starting to wonder if I'm just living again with Trent, Don't be in a beard in a big old fat suit.

Wait a minute, someone's impersonating Santa Claus.

I'm gonna gruff out some ideas of what to do.

I know you're a little kid, let me tell you what you do.

Take him in your closet, waterboard him, and then send a letter to me at Scruff my gruff.

Chicago Illinois 6065 II.

Oh, Dr. Scruffers, I would, but...

I don't even got a closet.

Santa keeps me in old basement.

I don't got a water or even a board.

Well, I don't know what to tell you, you're fucked.

Yeah, no chloroform either, I'd take it.

I got nothing, Scott.

This guy's got me...

He saw the posters, he saw that I was dicky, don't only little fingers sharp teeth, all those kinds of unique traits, and now he's got me making toys until my fingers are worked to a bloody...

This actually does sound like Santa Claus.

That actually might be Santa Claus.

I mean, if you're working toys down to the bone...

He might be Santa Claus.

This is Harry Styles, I don't know if you know who Harry Styles is, but kids love him.

Hi, Dicky, you know, I don't know if I'm ready to be a dad, but I would like adopt you as a mini-me if you wanted.

You can't be a dad, you're just a little boy like me.

No, I'm just a little baby dear in a vase.

You're too skinny to be a daddy, that's why I need Scott.

Big dad, Scott.

Please, Scottie, I love you, I love you.

This show has become just about insulting me.

Oh, I gotta say, Scott, the energy of the show when it started was everyone hates you, and Dicky came in and said, they love you, they love you right away, so there's a change.

Yeah, interesting.

Scott, bring those thick thighs over here and be my dad for one.

Scottie is big in the thighs.

Scottie, can I make a suggestion? Sorry, Henry and Amoebo over here.

Of course.

She's so sorry that you're in this predicament.

So you build toys for this, maybe Santa?

Yeah, I get into my will.

I'm getting absolutely mercury poisoning from all the eight balls.

You're making a lot of magic eight balls?

Yeah, they're filled with black goo that makes me cough.

So you're getting a side point, you're getting a lot of just requests to make magic eight balls as Christmas gifts?

Oh yeah, the kids are so horny for eight balls.

They want to know, yes, no, maybe so.

That and Lavalamp's made with real lava.

Ouchy, ouchy.

Oh, I'm so sorry, that sounds rough.

I was going to say, you know, I'm projecting my book's plot onto you, but what if you built a maze and made Santa run it and told them that the government will kill him if he's not there?

This is just your plot.

Well, I'm just saying it's something to think about.

If you're good at making things, make a maze.

His name's not Sally.

Okay, this is Dicky Donle.

Okay, Dolly, two-at-one, big heads, little ideas, gorgeous thoughts, big belly, deep belly button, open butt, small frame.

Dicky Donle, you shrunk one inch.

It's the last time you said something.

Now I do remember the posters.

It's just thoughts on it is what I recall.

Dicky, I must say, the thing that I love the most about you, I think, is gust of wind.

And I feel it, you know, do you want to strut about with me?

Would you like to strut about?

I've never strayed before, but I guess I'll try it.

Give it a whirl.

Careful, don't fall.

Yeah, there's a lot of...

Why, don't go upside down and fall and do a backpack.

Well, here's that fatherly instinct, Scott.

I love you, my gorgeous Scott.

Dicky, can I ask you a question?

Of course.

Dicky Donle.

Yeah, yeah, I don't.

This is Susie Tumen.

Hi.

You're approximately the same age, I would say.

Dicky, you might be older, actually.

I miss off more in high school.

I never got to go to school.

Kidnapped, as it were.

Oh, dang, I'm really sorry to hear that.

I don't have to say as it were.

It's literally what happened.

Ah, it's me, whoa.

There we go, Harry.

It's all right, we got it.

Can I ask?

I've been coming on this podcast.

What have you done to find your parents?

I've tried absolutely everything.

Felt out of a helicopter, put my chickeny legs on a treadmill, got onto a tree with a bunch of kids, disguised myself as a coconut, big Scott for housing, everything I can do.

Seems like that's what you're mainly focused on.

I'm not in the market for more children.

Scott, last time I did this podcast with you, it was near your big fancy pool, and you wouldn't even give me a cup of water.

Well, you don't want to drink what's in the pool.

It's pouring it in there.

Yeah, there's chlorine.

We were out of water in the main house.

Well, you said you pissed in the pool, and then you said you don't want this.

Right in front of you, yeah.

You said there's pissing it, and I said, well, now there is.

You know, I've been listening to this episode, and off Mike Scott seems so different than on Mike Scott.

Off Mike Scott is into shit and hentai and pissing in pools, and meeting Charles Barkley 10 to 15 times over the course of his life.

You know what, don't even worry.

I'm not a crazy liar.

I'm worried, Dickie, a human man can last two days without a single drop of water.

Jesus.

It's true, and you don't legally have to offer anyone anything.

So what are- You have a follow-up?

So I just wanted to know what your parents look like.

Maybe I can help.

Well, that's the thing.

I was kidnapped when I was such a wee lad.

I wasn't even tall enough to see their faces.

I only saw their little kneecaps.

One was big kneecaps, and one was little hairy ones.

Huh, so your parents never even showed you their faces?

They're too tall.

I was just a little shrimp bastard.

Yeah.

This is all so sad.

You know, I've got a question.

Dickie, what do you do for the holidays?

This is a great question, McGruff.

But, McGruff, this is a crime.

I mean, this is- I know it's a crime, but what do you want me to do?

This kid, she's tried everything.

Yeah, she's a good friend.

You know, they fell out of the helicopter, pretended to be a coconut, threatened to be trees with a bunch of kids.

What am I supposed to do?

This is a dumpy character, you should be out there arresting him.

Well, I'm on the hunt.

Yeah, you should be on the hunt for Trent Dumphey.

Because right now, I'm trapped in somebody's basement.

You know the toys skip it, that goes around your ankle and you skip around?

Yeah.

Well, that thing's tying me to a bed.

I'm making marbles, I'm making Rubik's cubes.

How'd you get away?

Yeah, how'd you get here?

I'm allowed to go on one four hour walk every day.

That's actually a long, great, great walk.

Here's the thing, cruel irony as it were.

Santa knows it takes four hours and 15 minutes to walk to the Burbank airport, so he only lets me out for four hours at a time.

So I can't make it anywhere.

So I just scuttled over here to make a radio announcement that I still look at my parents.

You can make it halfway there and then you gotta come back.

Yeah, exactly.

What about an Uber?

If I get it, a new percent is that it'll pull it in my brain.

Why don't you just walk to the airport at the four hour mark, you still have only 15 minutes to go before it realises.

Why don't you just adopt me and take care of me?

Okay, I don't know.

Side question from Henry Meebah, I'm so sorry.

Most of the toys you're mentioning, they seem to be 80s.

Yeah.

Rubik's cube, magic, eight balls.

Skip it.

Yeah, do you think Santa somehow like an older guy who's trapped in 80s references?

That's a good question, Emobiels.

I think that Santa might not be who he says he is.

Maybe he is Trent, Dunphy, and disguised, because all the other elves will guess what?

They're Marbles, Jason, Chrissy, Megan's, Rusty, Horde spots, Pickles, Borhead, and April Miggles, Hans-Krock.

All of your friends.

All my other missing kids.

I actually think that maybe Trent Dunphy is actually Santa, he wasn't Trent Dunphy, he's always been Santa.

I mean, we've heard this tale about the elves, about the short little creature.

He's just out there kidnapping kids.

I mean, he's giving presents to lure them, then he sticks them in his sleigh.

You fell out on the roller coaster, you say?

Yeah.

Into a giant sack?

This is Prime Santa.

It was a Jansport backpack.

Okay, well still, I mean.

But it was red!

Woah!

What's that mean?

Santa, Maspy Santa, Santa Claus!

That was beautiful.

I am really talented.

Harry, Harry, why don't you, I look, I know maybe he looks like a little boy, but Harry's pretty rich.

I mean, Harry could adopt you.

Yeah, I often do like a mini-me situation, not ready to be a full dad, a D-I-D.

But yeah, if you want to- Would you like to wear like giant pants and a tiny, tiny jacket?

Big shoes, tiny, tiny jacket.

Maybe a sage, taupe, nail polish.

That sounds just like me.

Dicky-dawnally, big pants, huge shoes, tiny jacket, little nipples, salami breath.

Dicky-dawnally, taupe.

Two for one.

Okay.

Dicky-dawnally, I'd be honored to have you come on tour with me.

Love on tour.

Wow, lovey on tour.

Would you like that, Dicky?

If you like that, we can set this up.

I do think I'm pretty good at seeing- You'll pay for it.

Yeah.

If you want to go on tour with him, we'll pay for it.

Yeah.

I thank you, Scott.

I love that, Scott.

You are going to pay child support.

You do feel bad.

I know we'd be a good match Harry, because every night when I'm trapped in Santa's basement, I press my little nose to the frosty window.

I think about my parents and I go, ♪ Where are you Christmas? ♪ ♪ Why can't I find you? ♪ ♪ Why have you gone my way? ♪ I really relate to the glitch.

Yeah.

Scott, do you remember that time you spent Christmas with my family in Leeds, Alabama?

Don't.

I do not remember that.

You gotta check your memories.

Well, Dicky, I don't know what we can do for you, but this is great of you.

And I love you would be good.

Scott, just why I love you.

I don't love my guests.

Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, if you- This is a professional relationship.

Scott, I have an idea.

Maybe if you whisper it, only I'll hear it.

Please, Scott.

I am.

Say it.

Good to have you on the show.

Thanks for coming on, Dicky.

It's great to have you.

We- I'll get you soon, Sucker.

Okay.

All right, Sucker.

We do need to get to our final guest of the day.

We got to know him a little bit earlier in the year.

I believe on the first episode of 2022, he is a- Well, I guess there's no other way to say it.

He's a flesh-colored cube that was invented by a mad scientist.

Please welcome back to the show, Dr. Sweetchat.

Hi.

Dr. Sweetchat.

Hi.

It's great.

Uh, great to- Hi, Chris.

Hi, Chris.

Hi.

Thank you.

Merry Christmas to you, Dr. Sweetchat.

Yeah, this is McGruff the Crime Dog over here.

Gazoon time?

What did you say?

How are you this inaudible a second time?

You're a program to be less audible.

You might have to repeat everything you say.

I'm reading lips at this point.

You might need to bring that thing up and off.

This is Charles Barkley.

Hey, baby.

76 or two.

Yeah, I'll play.

And Dickey Donnelly, of course.

Short hair.

Oh, yeah.

You look like one of the little toys I built in Santa's workshop.

You're so cute.

Oh, you wait 300 pounds.

Oh, yeah.

I think I'm doing it.

I think you're doing it.

He's right in two.

Wait, 300 pounds.

How do you got high density?

High fry.

I felt like we got a direct line on you this time, too, and it's even worse.

It's a lot worse.

What the hell is it?

Dr. Sweet Chat.

This is crazy.

Dr. Sweet Chat.

What?

Oh, right.

Holiday conversation starts.

Dr. Sweet Chat is a small chat robot.

It's a small, small, small robot.

Yes.

Small talk robot.

It's a good holiday conversation, sir.

I'm going home for you.

Oh, I'm sitting on the bottom of a pool.

That's beautiful.

I don't know a lot of people who do that.

I mean, it's a conversation starter.

Just so I understand, because since I'm not a human being, I maybe don't understand how conversations normally work.

I don't really want to be a good at it.

Walk up to somebody at a party and say, so have you gotten your Christmas shopping done, or are you waiting until the last minute to buy vinegar?

I'm casting no judgment.

It just...

The one boy.

The tall boy.

The home alone is what you think of.

No.

The tall boy who's home alone is apartment.

Dave.

Harry.

Oh, Requiem for a dream.

The tall boy.

The big!

Friends!

How are the duck?

Mr. Popper's penguin?

Oh, I can help.

I can help.

Okay, we'll just never find out what that was.

I'd like to hear a shriek.

Is that what you were asking?

What did the Grinch say to the Christmas hand?

Bye.

Who's there?

Oh, who?

Jewish mode.

Which is Jewish mode?

Jewish joke.

Sure.

Yeah.

To the what?

I think he's like the what?

Like on a bagel?

Okay, okay.

So what did the rabbi say to the locks?

The Jewish mode is more succinct.

What did the Jewish like a can't like a can't talk?

Okay.

That was really good.

Similar setup.

What did the Dredal say to the locks?

Sure.

You don't see that coming.

What did the oyve say to the oh no?

I feel like we're ripping through sequels here in one.

What?

Three famous Christmas songs?

I don't know anything.

This is a mistake.

Okay, sure.

Hold on.

I was turned.

Oh no someone turned.

How did we turn?

Oh my God.

We're picking between ginger juice little bummer boy.

And Christmas snakes.

I think we all wanted to hear Christmas snakes.

This is like the baby shark song.

Are you doing all of them?

Why did you ask what one we wanted to pick?

Yes.

All right.

Yeah.

We have no choice.

Singing me.

God, Jesus Christ.

What do you do for the holidays me?

Oh well I'm going to keep working on my next book.

I'm going to get together with family.

Family.

Yeah family the other amoebas that I split from.

You what?

Don't celebrate Jews?

Unis.

What's Eunice?

Eunice or Eunice?

Why you celebrate Eunice?

That's what you're saying.

This is a short man named Michael delivers something in chocolate.

Fitter chocolate.

To the most vulnerable in the community.

That's lovely.

I heard violent diarrhea definitely.

Now many flesh colored cubes die of violent diarrhea.

I guess so.

Are we still in Jewish mode?

It's so interesting to learn about other cultures.

That's good Dickey.

Yeah you're learning.

I'm learning against my mind.

He didn't even give us a chance to answer.

Black potato.

Also I didn't guess it.

I have to admit.

You said you guessed it.

What are you doing now, Dr. Sweetja?

What mode is this?

Yummy mode.

He's a master reading.

How is he doing that?

He's just a flesh cube.

Oh Jesus.

All right.

Okay.

Dr. Sweetja.

It's become even harder to understand you as this goes on.

We have to end this point.

I got to say Dr. Sweetja.

It seems as though you've got a bit of wire's loose in there.

Because everything this egg's just a little bit off.

You said Santa wears a little blue suit.

Tight blue suit.

And he's always begging for his beer to be yanked.

I don't think that's true.

Yeah you think you pop a smurf?

What mode is that?

Wow.

You thought we'd die on Christmas Eve alone.

Look, Dr. Sweetja.

We have to end this.

This is crazy.

Okay.

Missal tell what?

Am I under the mistletoe?

Wow.

Dr. Sweetja, we're under the mistletoe again.

Batman what?

I do know what it means.

Yes.

I don't think that's right.

Dr. Sweetja.

All right.

Well guys we are running out of time on this show.

What did Santa say to the reindeer?

All right.

We are running out of time.

Dr. Sweetja.

I'm so sorry.

We only have time for one final feature on the show, that is, of course, a little something called Plunguds.

Sometimes when I am getting to character I say the names Scott a few times.

I say Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott I Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott Scott omnis Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott.

Oh, oh. How are the Merry Christmas to you, huh?

Hey! That was great. That was springy, though.

Scott, what the hell was that?

Uh, oh, springy!

Hey, what's going on?

Uh, uh, nothing, man. Uh, what is it- I was hearing my own voice in here.

Yeah, it was just a song. It was a plug theme that someone made for you as an homage to you.

Someone used my voice without permission?

Ah, I mean, that sounds like a crime, Scott.

Oh, did you just turn into McGruff or is McGruff next to you?

No, I'm- Right next to him.

I'm- I'm- I'm springy. This is an animated dog.

Okay, uh, sorry, spring. Uh, that was Chris Finkey. He- he did that for you.

Oh, well, think is a good guy.

Is that McGruff?

No!

Scott.

No, it wasn't.

All right, I'm out of here. Happy- Happy Christmas.

Sing as Greg.

See ya.

Great to see ya.

All right, uh, McGruff, you want to plug anything?

Yes, Scott. I want to plug, um, look.

If you're out there and you like watching television, Scott, what's a little show called Grand Crew coming out next year?

Oh, Grand Crew.

Yes, season two. They're really funny, Cooper guys on there.

Yeah.

That's for the black audience.

Oh, okay. But, uh, it's a cr- it has crossover appeal.

Am I doing a British accent right now?

I do, for her.

Uh, all right, Harry Styles, what do you want to plug?

Love on tour, love yourself, nail polish.

Mm, okay.

For- By a boss.

Wonderful.

Uh, big deal.

Strut around.

Uh, Susie Tuman, what do you want to plug?

Oh, I gotta leave my ski trip early to go to court.

Ha!

This is an ad-y hospital burn unit collapse.

Oh, oh, the one- and you built that one?

Yeah.

Well, I didn't build it. My guys did.

Yeah.

So, I guess that- Okay, great. Good plug.

You're an awful person.

Uh, uh, do you- Do you mean that?

Yes.

Okay.

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

We'll take that down really easily. Charles Barkley, what do you want to plug?

Um, I got a lot of things. Watch NBA, own, uh, TNT.

Sure.

Just any game?

Inside NBA. Watch our NBA game.

Are you guys in every game?

Well, uh, no, just the ones on TNT.

Wait, that's what I mean.

Turn a network television.

Sure. Yeah.

We- No matter what- Comedy.

Okay. All right.

And then also, uh, listen to the flagram ones hosted by Shawna Hayes and Carl.

Ha!

Huh, do they ever- I got a question.

Do they ever drop the ad- I still don't know.

No, no, no.

Okay.

Uh, is that all you have to plug?

And, uh, I like to show that, that, uh, the dog here just mentioned.

Grand crew.

Does it only appeal to dogs though?

Uh, a black dog.

Oh, that's Epland style.

Only rock waters.

All right.

The Dovalent Pictures.

Uh, Henry, the amoeba, what do you want to plug?

I have a series of things I'd like to plug.

Okay.

But I'll make it quick.

On CBB Presents, a podcast that I believe this audience would be, uh, a fan of.

There's an episode recently called Morpheus' Book of Nightmares that I just enjoyed to listen to as a listener only.

I had nothing to do with that podcast.

I'd also like to plug another podcast called Screw.

We're just going to talk about comics.

These two fellas will and Kevin Heinz talk about comic books.

And, uh, if you like, uh, two middle-aged guys, grousing, very moderate takes on things you maybe haven't read, that's the podcast for you.

And then finally, I'd also like to plug Grand crew, especially the presence of an immigration lawyer in the second episode played by my favorite actor, Will Heinz.

That's for the amoebas in the audience.

That's for the amoebas.

The amoebas listeners.

I think they will like Grand crew also.

That's it for me.

Dickie Donnelly, what do you want to plug?

Well, I got to plug the, finding the parents for all my other friends.

Megan Merkley, Big Crams, Egghead, handjob reason, razorbox, and Britman.

Not marble dickhead?

Marble dickhead is hopeless.

And, uh, well, I'm going to regret asking this, but...

Dr. Sweetchat, do you have anything to plug?

Yes, you!
