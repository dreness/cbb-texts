♪♪♪ You can paint a whole zebra with half a can of paint.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

I never really thought about it that way, but yeah, you can.

Thank you to Hugh Junderpants for that wonderful catchphrase submission.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another edition, very special, first week of October edition.

We only get to celebrate the first week of October once a year on Comedy Bang Bang, and we're doing it today.

Beginning of Q4, as we call it here.

Q4, corner 4.

And we have a great episode for you.

By the way, my name is Scott Ockermann.

I'm the host of Comedy Bang Bang.

Come here a little later on the show.

We have someone who works in public relations.

Looks like we have a recent widow.

Oh, I wonder how recent.

Boy, that's going to be a bummer talking to them, but we also have someone in the lumber industry.

So you can see exactly what type of show this is, but before them, celebs are back.

Celebs are back.

There was such a long fallow period of time when we had no celebs on the show because no one wanted to come to my backyard where we were taping the show, but now we're back in studio celebs are back.

And we have one of our favorites here.

This is his second time on the show, a returning guest.

And you know him as the lead singer and songwriter of the band, Semi-Sonic.

And you know him as the songwriter of such iconic songs as Adele's Hello.

And he has a new EP out called Dancing on the Moon.

What?

These are three surprising facts.

Please welcome Dan Wilson.

Hello, back to the show.

Thank you for the welcome back.

Yeah, so I guess I'm like an old veteran now.

You're an old favorite.

Yeah.

Well, a lot of people don't know.

We've talked about it a few times is we do first and last episode, the first time you come in.

And then the last.

Oh, I see.

So this is still this will be the last time.

This was from years ago.

Yeah.

So we record.

We record first.

It's a lot like rent checks.

He gets first month last month.

So bleak.

It sounds like knowing the day you die.

It's not something you really want.

But I guess that you planned recording or this new EP, Dancing on the Moon, which is coming out this week, years into dance.

Yeah.

You got to have a plan.

You need to know what's happening in Q4.

Yeah.

It's great to see you.

So I was so thrilled when word came through the wire that you were requesting to do the show again.

Yeah.

Because.

It's one last time.

I could never quite tell if anyone has a good time or not.

That's interesting.

And I kind of left that one going like, I hope he had a good time, but who knows?

So I'm glad to see you.

Oh, I had a really good time.

Oh, good.

Oh, by the way, I didn't write hello by a.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Which one did you?

Someone like you.

That's right.

But you, but you can just say that I wrote it.

I mean, you said hello to her.

Right.

And also it fit in with your sort of up speak of.

Yeah.

Thank you for not correcting me in the middle of.

Hello.

I'm not going to be a good person.

You can, really, but you're not allowed to say.

No, but you can, but everyone has their favorites.

Wow.

I have my favorites, but it's almost like, you know, if I said my favorite is dancing on the moon and you said, oh, well, my favorite song of yours is closing time, I'd go like, what?

You don't like dancing on the moon?

I'm hurt.

Yeah.

I'm not going to be saying yourself or was it something that someone else say?

Wow.

These are basic questions, Dan.

No, that's a good one.

I should really like, really, if you do any press at all.

I should look within once I should introspect more.

I appreciate you making this your first stop on your press tour, but these are the kind of things people are going to be asking.

What kind of naval gase or do you think I am?

No, I don't know.

I mean, there's a couple of semisonic songs that I really love.

There's one called D&D, which I...

D&D, Do Not Disturb, which I had no idea what it meant.

I thought you were talking about D&D Dungeons and Dragons.

Yeah, so a lot of my nerdy friends thought they were like, yeah, it's finally...

Finally, he does one for us.

That's bro.

Yeah.

But that song is essentially about putting on the Do Not Disturb.

Yeah, let's just...

And just...

It's a little bit like dancing on the moon.

It's a little bit like the same theme.

Right.

I don't know.

I really love not ready to make nice that I did with the Dixie Chicks, kind of because it was so useful for them.

Right.

It really...

It did something really, really powerful in their sets for the tour that they went on afterwards.

It was a way to state their case and then they would...

If they didn't want to explain, they just had the song.

Did you ever go see them live and then while they're singing that song, you're pointing at yourself and then making the writing motion?

Yeah, but nobody knows.

Nobody is good enough at hieroglyphics to understand that.

Yeah.

I think I believe my wife and I's favorite songs would be the act naturally is I think number one for us and then One True Love.

I believe those are our favorites.

One True Love has Carol King on it's how could you not love that.

Yeah.

That was our like...

That was the band's secret crowning glory because none of our rock friends thought it was cool at all that we had Carol King on, but we knew better.

Well, it kind of recontextualized her for me too, where I was like, oh man, because it was 2000 I think that record came out and it was like, oh wow, I haven't thought about Carol King in a while, but here she is guesting on this great record and then I tried to replicate her backing vocals when we were driving home the other night and I did not succeed.

Does that surprise you?

She's hard to beat.

Yeah, she's hard to beat.

But I tried.

Well, I came close.

I got 99% of it.

That's called hubris.

A lot of people know you, of course, from closing time, which is...

I mean, as opposed, I guess Adele's song would be your biggest hit, but the biggest hit that you sang is closing time.

Yeah, that's right.

That's right.

Yeah.

I mean, it's interesting because the...

I've written so many songs and it's not like, you know, a noticeable percentage of them do well.

Like, on average...

Like you've written probably...

Nothing happens.

You've written 500 songs and three were huge.

Yeah, so the, you know, the median is one of you.

So you view yourself as a failure.

Yeah.

And then you think most of the time and then once in a while, it's insane thing happens.

Because every single time you write a song, you're hoping that it's number one for 20 weeks.

And I'm like the parent who thinks this one is the best one ever.

Finally, I've said it all.

But when you wrote closing time, were you like running around...

I'm assuming you're in an apartment at that point.

Are you running around your apartment just like high-fiving, imaginary people going, I fucking did it.

No, it's funny because I still haven't...

I don't have a, you know, banger meter in my brain that says, you know, smash or whatever.

Bangdar.

I don't have Bangdar, but I do have a cryptic one, which is, I can't wait to play this for my friends.

Oh.

But I never link the two.

Like, I'm always like, oh shit, I have to play this for my friends.

But I don't go and that's the...

That's the obvious first single, yeah.

That's the tell, yeah.

You get to be one of your friends where like you're calling them up going, let me play this song.

I just wrote five minutes ago.

I like to be in that category.

Okay, but there's a lot of songs.

That's my responsibility.

I'm okay.

I'll listen to the 490s and shitty ones.

Yeah, and this is the 12th bad one in a row.

No, don't call again unless it's really good.

Did you win, because you were on major-ish labels, right?

Yeah.

Yeah, right?

I've been on too many major labels.

I've been...

It's like going over to the other side.

Right.

You can't be on six major labels and say you did great, but that's what I did.

Yeah, you had minor experiences on major labels.

Exactly.

Brief, brief, fores, flings.

Did...

Was there ever an experience where they were like, hey, this is the single, and you were like, this person's fucking crazy.

Well, that has happened and also...

Well, when closing time...

I've had both sides.

When closing time, when we finished that record, feeling strangely fine, we sent it to the label.

They said, we can't put this out.

It has no singles.

And it had three songs that charted really well, including that one.

But at the time, they said, you know, you've got to go back and do more songs so we can have some hits.

And I was like, basically, because my whole approach to music has always been, how can we scam someone into giving us a budget so we can record more?

Right.

So this was like a win for me.

I was like, yes.

They're going to give us more money.

That's how I felt about the bit between Two Ferns movie was like, they're like, I got to say, we don't like the ending.

You have to shoot more.

I'm like, all right, right.

Yeah, we get a lot of money.

I can go back and fix other things too.

Yeah, but my manager, Jim, said no.

Unless you think you can beat those three songs, you know that the label will pick the ones that they commissioned, no matter whether they're better or not.

So you held out?

So we just turned off our phones and disappeared from it.

And then closing.

Oh, you turned off.

You had phones back then.

This is like 1997.

Barely.

How do you turn those off?

You unplug them from the wall or?

The house?

Yeah.

Yeah, exactly.

And you were on the...

And this came up recently in my life.

You were on the 10 Things I Hate About You soundtrack.

Yeah.

And what was that song that was...

Is it FNT?

FNT.

Were you...

I'm the acronym guy.

D-N-D-F-N-T.

This is my wheelhouse now.

If it was a brand I didn't really protect it very well because I was on it only too.

No.

I did.

I was wondering why you gave up so easy.

Didn't realize that it was my look.

And instead it was just a flirtation.

But of course I just watched that movie for the first time on for my other show, Scott Hasn't Seen, where I watched movies that I haven't seen before.

And suddenly that song started playing and I'm like, There we go.

There's my boy.

There's my friend just going to call me and play me some...

Some bad songs.

My teenage daughter recently watched that.

You have 10 rules about dating her or seven...

How many rules is it?

Seven.

Ten Things I Hate About You?

No, no.

There's a never mind.

There was a sitcom about dating my teenage daughter.

How many rules?

I got to look this up now.

You go ahead and talk.

You find it.

I'll just babble.

You go ahead and talk and I won't listen to you.

My daughter and her friends were watching 10 Things I Hate About You for...

I don't know why or how that happens in the current culture.

Ten rules.

But they were...

And they were stunned when I started singing.

Oh yeah.

When I started singing they were stunned and she was stunned.

Oh really?

And my cred briefly skyrocketed and I was back to normal.

Like, Mill.

No, it's not that...

So what are these eight rules?

I don't know that we ever found them out because unfortunately...

Unfortunately, what's his name passed away before that show ever got to the rules, I believe.

What was his name?

He played Jack Tripper on Three's Company.

What?

Sad that such a wonderful career is reduced to me not remembering his name.

John Ritter.

Of course.

John Ritter is his...

He had eight rules for something?

He had eight simple rules for dating his daughter.

This is so alarming I can't even like get...

You should write this song though because like the rules were never explained.

It sounds so offensive even just to mention it without knowing what it's about.

But when you think about songwriting structure eight rules you can get through those in like two verses.

And then a chorus?

I mean this is like not a bad idea for a song.

But wait, are we talking like who in the world would date their daughter?

I don't understand.

Oh, I see the misunderstanding.

Well, what would it be?

No, these are rules he's telling to prospective suitors for dating my teenage daughter.

Oh, oh, well even that sounds bad.

Okay, okay, now I get it.

Now I get it.

So the entire time I was talking about this you assumed that he was making rules for himself to date his own daughter?

I was like it was feeling so harmed by that.

I was though.

I was like what the fuck?

What am I missing?

Dear, you have teenage daughter or daughters.

One, I'm a 25 year old and a 15 year old.

Do they understand what you do?

I mean they obviously understand what you do.

But is it just like are they proud of when something like Adele comes out with a big hit?

Are they like telling people at school?

Do you know like yeah, my dad wrote that song.

Are they embarrassed?

Are they proud?

Like a combo.

Like a combination of deep embarrassment and occasional pride.

They even enjoy listening to a song that you wrote like the rest of the world does.

See I like to think that secretly they like it and they just make me think that they don't.

I like to think that underneath the sneering and the disregard is kind of respect.

Yeah, I think that would be cool to say to you.

Although it would be terrible if like they were suddenly that song comes on they go, my dad wrote this and they're like, that song sucks.

They feel bad about it.

I think my daughter's friends were too polite to say the song in 10 things I hate about you was bad.

I don't think they thought it was bad.

Yeah it's a good song.

They were enjoying the movie.

What is it?

FML?

What is it again?

TNT.

No not TNT.

It's FNT.

What if you wrote...

Here's my new pitch TNT.

You write a song about the Turner...

TBS, Turner Broadcasting System.

I'll just do only songs with...

Yeah.

I'm a recipe.

Wonderful.

Well dancing on the moon is out now.

Just came out a couple of days ago and you're here you're going to be doing songs for us.

I'll do a couple of songs.

A couple of songs.

That's incredible.

And you're going to stick around and be sort of my co-host.

As long as I can.

You're the Ed McMahon to my...

I don't know who else.

I'm the Fern.

Not Johnny Carson.

I'll be one of the Ferns.

Okay great.

Well wonderful.

Well we have to get to our next guest.

Dan Wilson is here dancing on the moon in stores now.

But let's get to our first non-musician guest.

Of three non-musician guests.

That's fantastic.

Okay he is in public relations.

I mentioned this.

And I've never met him before.

I don't believe.

This is my first time.

Hi.

How are you?

This is Cecil Sotheby.

Hi.

Hi Scott.

Hi.

It's so great to meet you.

You know what it is so nice.

This is Dan by the way.

Dan it is lovely to meet you.

And lovely to meet you Scott.

Thank you so much.

It's our pleasure.

For having me here I'm a fan of the podcast.

Oh you are.

You've listened to this.

Hopefully not the early episodes.

Even the early episodes.

Don't cancel me.

No no.

I thought you meant for their roughness.

But I liked seeing how slowly it became a polished jewel.

Thank you so much.

Not too slowly I hope.

I thought we did okay.

Oh no.

The jewel was polished very quickly Scott.

But it was unpolished for a few episodes though.

But then it was a quick polish.

Yes but unpolished diamond still sparkles.

It's a good point.

That's good.

Would you throw a diamond in the trash because it hadn't been polished?

No only if the trash was other diamonds.

And it was actually a fake trash can where you kept your diamonds to throw the scent off of burglars.

Burglar would walk by and say.

That's just a area diamond in there.

Good point.

Cecil why are you here?

Well all this talk of diamonds you must know that I am a collector of just an appreciator, a curator of rare items.

I, my dave, is Cecil Sotheby as in Sotheby's auction house.

Oh so are you one of the?

Yes.

Okay yes my great great grandfather was Terrence Sotheby.

Oh and he began.

You see the guy who started Sotheby's?

Yes he began the auction house.

Have you ever gone to a Sotheby's auction before?

No I see the real estate signs every once in a while and like oh that house must be fancy.

Because it has a reputation for being like the fanciest stuff.

Yeah and they're very, we're very choosy about who we give the brand to.

The real estate was one of the rare offshoots so we haven't, it's the auction house and real estate.

Oh okay so where are you involved in the business?

Public relations so that's why I come here and.

So you're the, I saw on the media list.

Comedy bang bang.

Oh I said I'll take that one.

Okay because I'm a fan so I wanted to come in.

Thank you so much.

But what are you, when you say you're doing public relations for Sotheby's or you or it's Sotheby's branded public relations?

No we're having an upcoming auction.

Oh that you want to get the word out of it?

Yes.

Oh great let's talk about it.

I think your list is anybody would have a lot of interest in it.

I actually brought the catalog here.

Oh okay.

I brought a catalog for you.

Oh thank you so well.

Wow I want to call me.

Did you bring one for Dan or?

Dan here you go here's a catalog as well.

Yeah I noticed you brought that third catalog and you weren't offering it to him so I apologize if you were keeping that in reserve for something else.

Well we have an expression.

We at Sotheby's have a catalog three's.

Oh great expression of course.

And if there's four people then we just say five and rhyme it with Sotheby's.

Oh and then you can't.

Yeah in the car.

Yes.

But we have a very exciting auction of celebrity items.

Oh wow.

Items owned by celebrities.

Owned by.

Yes and they're a state if they've passed on or if they're alive.

Not to speak so coarsely but they of course they put up their items for auction.

They get some of the money and our auction house.

And then the person goes home with a beautiful piece of.

I know how auctions work.

Is that what you're trying to do?

If only your razor wit could be on the auction block.

Well then I need it in case I do more of the show.

Don't ever give it up.

Okay thank you so much.

So what are these items?

I you know the last time I ever did anything like this was back right when we started the show back in 2009 of Paul Shear and Rob Hubel and I went to the Michael Jackson auction of all the things from his life that were going to be auctioned which they pulled before they actually auctioned them.

Do do do what?

Do do excuse me do to.

I don't remember why there was some sort of issue where they were like we don't know who actually owns these things so they pulled everything but it was fascinating to go look at the things that was mainly a lot of unique items.

You know like a Peter Pan headboard I remember.

Yes I mean those are more eccentric items but at this level you know they're there.

Fairly what what's interesting if I may say is no let's get to the interesting there is their quotidian objects.

They're there everyday objects it's just the fact that oh yes this celebrity must have owned this and held this at the point that gives it the so for instance for example we have a.

Thanks for dumbing it down for us he said for instance first and I was like what is he talking about and then you change it to for example so I appreciate that for the lay people out there.

I was gonna start with IE.

Oh boy don't I dumped it down before even that.

A pair of Cary Grant's cufflinks.

Wow well that Cary Grant was one of the most dapper celebrities movie star incarnate he kind of exemplifies old Hollywood glamour.

Yes nobody better than him before or dare I say after.

Really so you think it that was just the apex.

Just in terms of movie star charisma.

Okay so his cufflinks along with a tennis racket owned by Marilyn Monroe.

I had no idea she ever even played tennis I don't think there are any pictures of her playing tennis.

Well she wanted to she took lessons and she bought a fine tennis racket she wanted to practice in style.

Oh so we have that up for auction along.

But she didn't keep it up she didn't ever you said she wanted to.

Oh she took when I spoke to her estate I did ask I said how many lessons didn't miss Monroe take with this for real.

And they said Cecil I said Cecil Cecil if it's more than three we'd be shocked.

It's like unlike she went more than so she's held this racket for approximately lessons are typically 45 minutes about two hours and 15 minutes of her life.

Right but it has the story attached to it what the story you just told me.

Yes I heard this story on the podcast.

About the guy mispronouncing your name.

Yes.

Okay and of course the story that Marilyn she only took three lessons and she gave it up and look at this racket.

Oh okay well this is good this is a little less.

And it's not just movie stars of your.

Oh it's a present-day movie stars like Vin Diesel a cigar box made of Mahogany.

Okay great.

Well hug it.

Has he inscribed it with anything or is it.

I believe it was a crew gift.

Hmm so it's Fast and Furious branded.

Yes.

Next on the list.

This is from the Duke.

I don't know if you remember John Wayne.

Stick them up hard.

Stick them up partner I'm here already.

Yeah get out of the way the Duke is here.

Yeah he is he's right here in front of me and Scott went somewhere.

Okay now he's back drinking water.

I wondered where Scott went because I thought it was John Wayne.

He through his estate we got a pair of his motorized boots spurs.

What?

Motorized boots spurs.

Yes.

You can just say spurs by the way in the description by the way.

Well what makes these what makes these an interesting object to be sure an interesting item to be sure is most spurs are not motorized.

Oh I know that's why you had to say motorized both yes spurs because John Wayne said why do my spurs have to move according to how I move my can't they move on a motor.

So he had some Hollywood wizards cook up some motorized boots spurs an interesting item such as a Meryl Streep.

Are you a fan of Meryl Streep?

Interesting item such as Meryl Streep.

Oh no she's item.

You're moving on from the motorized boots spurs.

So many very very very very.

It's almost as if you're embarrassed.

There's lots of items.

I'm now looking at this catalog there so many you took so much time with these first three and they were so uninteresting that I figured that's the pace we're going to go at but no.

You expected two normal ones.

At least by the third one we know no three normal.

All right.

Let's run through these.

Well you'll be very excited to know that we have and we can explore any of these feel free to talk about them.

Meryl Streep for auction she has her wedding dress caked in slime.

What what what from death becomes her something or her first wedding.

She got married in the bayou.

And so it all green swamp slime has covered her wedding dress.

From tip to tail.

So she got married in the middle of a swamp her first wedding.

Yes I did I just this is Meryl there's pictures Meryl Streep down in the bayou.

It was a people cover story cover story they paid for it if she agreed to have her wedding in a swamp.

This doesn't sound like Meryl Streep I mean any part.

Well it was for a role.

The way this is a method she was doing it as research for what role.

Swampy Lisa and in adaptation she follows Chris Cooper through a swap to the Everglades which is like a swamp.

Okay I don't remember this movie but I mean would you be interested in an item like this.

No I don't I mean if it were from a famous movie like Wizard of Oz like the Ruby slippers or something.

That's the kind of thing that I it's iconic Hollywood lore that I don't even remember.

I mean Meryl Streep's done a ton of movies that I couldn't even list them all but swampy Lisa I don't even remember this one.

That was a spec script I wrote for Meryl Streep.

Oh so she never even made it you're a writer?

Well I'm from the Sotheby's.

That doesn't explain it.

Dynasty.

That doesn't explain it either.

It's just they were sitting on many cans that look like trash cans but are filled with diamonds.

But why are you a writer?

All you've mentioned is your job and why you're rich.

That was my previous career when I was a writer.

I wrote a spec script called swampy Lisa we got funding Meryl Streep committed to the part.

She said my money to be like swampy Lisa.

I'm crying because I'm not worried about what I love swampy Lisa.

So this is how you came into possession of this wedding dress.

Well yeah please stop crying sir this is embarrassing for you it's mortifying.

I know maybe you're disappointed that it's not a piece of like a prop or a costume from a movie.

But neither is this item but I think you might like it.

Great what is it?

Despite that Morgan Freeman's levitating deck chair.

And it's not from a movie it's just his he had a levitating deck chair at home.

Yes.

Like levitating in what way is this off the ground.

But how does it do it is it like what kind of I don't think that things levitate.

I mean other than those like jetpacks on the on the water you know that are.

Oh yes a sort of propulsion system.

Yeah exactly.

Well I asked I was able to speak with Morgan Freeman.

Oh okay.

And I asked him how does this work the levitation and he went popcorn power my boy popcorn power.

So I guess there's curls popcorn that pop inside and weird guy levitate the deck chair.

But I have not heard of popcorn power technology at this point but interesting.

What was that?

Popcorn power technology.

Oh you whispered it I couldn't even.

No I didn't whisper I was saying I said it pretty much just the at the volume in cadence I've been speaking in.

Yeah so did I.

What?

I think you blew out your own ear drums.

Did I get louder?

I think you did yeah.

How many more do you have because this is.

Well we can run through them very quickly because they are very amusing.

For instance how quickly can you do this if you had to if you had to really guess.

A minute.

All right let me put a minute on the clock here.

All right let me I'm opening my phone.

I'll give you 60 seconds and you're going to edit in real time.

Which everyone's okay are you are you ready?

Here we go and go.

Probably, but...

Dan, how are you feeling about following that with one of your new songs?

I don't know.

It's a jarring transition, I realize.

My fingers are numb from laughing.

Okay.

All right.

This is dancing on the moon.

♪ All those nights when we waited for a time to be alone.

And now we're lonely all the time.

Sidewalk seems like a faded memory in a rolling stone.

♪ Now they cut me like a knife.

All right, we're going to take a break.

When we come back we'll have more from Dan Wilson, more from Cecil South of E, and also a recent widow and someone in the lumber industry will be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang we're back with Dan Wilson.

He just treated us to his favorite song on his new EP, Dancing on the Moon.

Is that track one on the EP?

It's not, it's track three.

Track three, see this is, you know, albums that usually start with the best song, right?

And then they get worse and worse and worse until then.

It's not really how we plan them out, but yes.

But you know what I mean?

They're always like, we got to grab someone's attention, so put the best one.

Whereas like if you go to a movie it's usually like kind of slow at the beginning and then gets really good at the end, right?

Wow, that's amazing actually.

I haven't really thought of it.

I have to confess, like if I listen to somebody's album, I'm in the car, I start listening, I'm like, this is so great, it's awesome.

Then like four songs in, I get to where I'm going, and I turn it off.

Next time I get inspired to listen to the same record, I start from the beginning.

Start from the beginning, exactly.

We're 18 minutes.

Well that's why four songs, that's why I think musicians need to time their records out for the average car trip.

Totally.

You know, which is why- That's what an EP?

This is an EP and so yeah, this literally will take as long as it can.

From my house to this studio is my EP.

Guaranteed.

We also have Cecil Sotheby's here.

You're not going to say anything?

Oh yes.

And he backed away from the mic.

Yes, I'm glad to be here, Scott.

Thank you.

Yeah, I just wanted to include you.

Oh, and I love the song.

It was beautiful.

Thank you.

Are you messing with him the same way you were messing with me earlier with all your fake products?

No.

My sincerity to you, Scott, wasn't fake.

Okay, but your products were fake.

No, they were real.

Wait, I'm confused now.

From the twisted mind of Sotheby's.

Okay, like Danny DeVito?

That's the brand.

That's always been the brand.

All right.

Well, we need to get to our next guest.

She's a recent widow.

This is terrible, but we'll talk to her about this.

Please welcome Myrtle McGee.

Oh, hello.

I am absolutely delighted to be here.

Oh, good.

Well, first of all, my sympathies and my condolences to...

No need.

No need, no need.

No, I have had 17 husbands and I've never been divorced.

Oh, so 17 of your husbands have passed away?

Yes, they've all passed over the years.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

And some people would look at it as tragedy and I just...

I really live by the old saying, it's better to have made love and lost than never to have made love at all.

I don't know that that's the saying, but...

Yeah.

So how long were your marriages?

Oh, varying lengths.

I mean, I...

I would hope so.

They were to the day.

That would be so strange.

Many of them, I lost them in really tragic, tragic ways.

But I really, I look at...

I still look at my life as I've been very, very fortunate to have loved so many people.

And not only my husband's, but I've had a...

a veritable plethora of...

of affairs, you know.

Oh, sexual illness?

So I was gonna say, like, you've had sex with at least 17 people, but...

Oh, oh.

Your numbers are actually even more than that.

And many, many high-profile Hollywood elites as well.

In fact, some of the people that Cecil here mentioned from his list.

Oh, from my auction list.

Absolutely, Carrie-crans.

I recognize Carrie-crans.

You know, I...

You're an older woman, we should say that.

I think yes.

I don't know if we...

And we got that from the voice, but you have that kind of like old woman voice.

I'm in my mid-80s.

I don't tell anyone the number, but I do.

I will admit it's my mid-80s.

You don't look...

It sounds like...

A day over mid-40s.

Oh, wow.

You are a sweet young...

You don't look at day over early-80s, I would say.

Oh, I'll take it.

Oh, wow.

I'll take it.

No, Carrie-crans, you were talking about his boots-spurs.

John Wayne.

And Carrie-crans coupling.

Carrie-crans...

All the same.

Oh, yeah.

All the same.

The careers of these men don't matter to me at all.

What matters to me is how they were as lovers.

And both of them were excellent lovers.

In fact, you know, if...

I'll use a euphemism and say, I put those boots right under my bed.

Oh, with the motorized spurs.

Oh, yeah.

So you...

What did they call sluts back in the 40s?

Oh, boy.

I'm flus-y, but I'm fine with any name.

You know, it doesn't bother me.

It's not a slut.

It's honestly someone who's just proud to be in your body.

You're sex-positive.

Absolutely.

You're the original sex-positive person.

The original.

I pioneered sex-positivity.

Yes, and it's falling in love.

17 times means you're a flus-y, well then.

Call me!

I'm a flus-y too.

You've fallen in love 17 times?

Yeah.

Are you married?

I didn't even...

This hasn't come out.

I mean, I'm not really interested, but are you married?

I'm interested.

I am currently married.

Current.

Why do you say it like that?

Currently married?

Oh, I'm sorry.

Happily married.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, that's different.

Yeah.

I'm not interested in that.

All right.

So you've been with a lot of men.

I've been with many men.

And many of them have gone in very tragic ways.

Right.

17 of them.

But have your boyfriends also died?

Oh, no, but I have just had affairs here and around those marriages.

Okay.

But no, my husband's have all died rather tragically.

I'm so sorry.

Yeah, no, that's okay.

Yeah.

Who's the first if you don't mind me?

If this was Arthur.

Arthur.

Oh, gosh, let me think back in my memory.

Must have been winter of 68.

And it was our first Christmas together.

For recent, but I thought.

Oh, I would have thought.

Yeah.

And, um, well, I am all.

I know, but I thought your first one would have been.

Oh, my first was even older than it could have been.

Because you were a 28 or so.

My memory is.

Yeah.

But it is what it is.

Yeah.

He was our first Christmas together and he was purchasing a mistletoe because he thought we could have some fun little smooches under our little eyes.

And unfortunately, he was crushed under a cast-eye and stove in the loading dock of Montgomery Ward.

Oh, no.

What was he doing in the loading dock?

He was trying to purchase mistletoe.

I don't think he was in the loading dock.

I don't think they sell that.

Yeah.

Not in the loading dock.

No.

You know, that silver lining on that one was that they gave me that cast-eye and stove for free.

Oh, okay.

And I still have it.

Yeah.

I can make a batch of moist muffins in that cast-eye and stove.

Oh, okay.

It's like the auction.

Now it's an item with a story.

It's absolutely an absolute...

It's an absolute...

It's the cast-eye.

A way to see the bright side of things, that's a lie.

I knew we'd get along.

I see.

Okay.

So that was the first.

That was the first.

Is that the most gruesome way?

I can't imagine being crushed under that part.

Oh, gosh.

No, I mean, that's our relative.

Everyone has their own take on what was the most gruesome.

Let's see.

My second husband, Remington, he was...

Remington.

He was hunting in the Amazon and he accidentally sucked in on a blowgun.

Oh, that's...

You're supposed to blow out.

You're supposed to blow out, but it's so tempting because it looks like a giant straw.

Exactly.

And he just sucked in and he took a poison dart right to the trick here.

Oh, no.

That's horrible.

You're dying.

These details are so terrible.

I hope it's okay.

Oh, it is.

Are you to share these?

Oh, no.

Again, I have no...

You know, I suffered the grief of it at the time and now I just look at it as a blam.

To have been loved and loved that person.

Yeah.

To see somebody work through that process of grief is very inspiring.

Oh, absolutely.

Yeah.

Wow.

What about the third person?

The third has been...

I just want to ask questions about each person.

The third one was...

Was...

Orland.

And...

Orland.

Orland with a D.

With a D.

Sort of like Orlando.

Sure.

Take away the...

Oh, if you want to say Orlando, you just take away the...

Oh.

Like famous...

The final...

Like the movie star Orland...

Junes.

Oh.

You take out the O's.

Got it.

You didn't take out the first one though.

Oh.

Orland...

Okay, stop.

Here it is.

Stop.

Please, you have to stop sensible.

I really want you to ask yourself, if you're going to butt into the conversation, I really want you to ask yourself, is this worth it?

Butt!

In!

Okay, well...

Oh!

Let's see.

Orland.

We were skiing in the Swiss Alps and it was nighttime and we thought, you know what would be really fun is if we just snuck onto the slopes and did a little sledding on our own.

Oh, okay.

So we pulled off one of the...

You know how...

Around the poles for the...

The slaloms?

Or the...

The poles that hold up the chair lifts?

That's what it is.

Oh.

Some sort of padding on it.

We took that off and we went sledding.

Oh, okay, using the pads as...

Hit that very same pole.

Oh, the padded list.

Oh, off of.

And so he was in front.

That's like the most ironic way that any of your husbands have died.

That is a very good point.

If you think about it that way, that could...

Yeah, that's...

Isn't it ironic?

Short story by Henry.

Oh, yeah?

Oh, Henry, that's the most...

I understand.

See, that was a good call.

Well, okay, then.

It worked me up.

Yeah, Dan's awake suddenly.

What?

You knew me.

Oh, yeah.

Well, how did your most recent husband pass away?

Because you were a recent widow?

Yes, recent.

How many weeks ago?

A couple weeks ago.

Yeah, that was in September.

You know, the thing is, is like, when you've had 17 husbands, you can't mourn too long.

You don't mourn for long.

And also, you have...

I get black for a day and I move on.

You have so little time left in your life, I would imagine.

Yeah, I'm not gonna waste it.

You're gonna waste two years mourning this guy?

That's really not, though.

Your 17th husband?

How did he die?

That was Mitch.

And Mitch died.

Mitch.

He was, you know, it was a bit...

It's not Mitch from the doe boys, is it?

No, not from the doe boys.

Oh, thank God.

But I do love him.

Oh, he's brilliant.

I'll put an word for you.

You please do.

You know, we were in a very competitive game of Chubby Bunny.

Was Chubby Bunny?

Chubby Bunny is where you try to fit a lot of marshmallows in your mouth at the same time.

Oh, okay.

And so he was on a roll.

I mean, he was...

This is a competing where you stick one in a lot like the Indiana Jones drinking game.

Yep, and everyone does it the same time.

Yep, sure.

It's like a hot dog eating contest, except you're using marshmallows and you're not swallowing.

It's like any competitive eating competition, but...

Except you don't swallow.

You don't swallow.

The whole point is you want to see how many you can fit in your mouth at once.

Right.

You're trying to puff up your cheeks.

Sure.

And so, yeah.

So, like Marlon Brando and the Godfather.

Absolutely.

Also a wonderful love, I mean.

Oh, I would imagine.

And so he had 71 in his...

71.

Right, and he started really flailing about and we thought he was celebrating because he had just been the world record.

And that was not what was happening.

Wow, the world record is 70.

He choked it up.

Well, now it's 71.

Now it's 71.

Because he did do it.

He did do it.

Well, they don't say it's the world record for having that many marshmallows without time.

I didn't know that.

Absolutely not.

It happened.

He was alive when he put the 75.

I guess he had to stick 72 marshmallows in a corpse's mouth and beat the record.

I think the rule is he has to be alive when you put it in.

What about...

Could it be a dog?

Is it like air-bud rules as well?

Sure.

Yeah.

I'd love to see it.

I'd love to see a dog put 72 in his mouth.

Oh, man.

But we could say, I mean, Mitch died doing what he loves dogs.

Like he's not.

Oh, and he would be so happy.

If he knew that that's how he went, I mean, he...

Do you think...

He does know.

Yeah, do you think we have cognizance after we're dead?

Or do you think it's just like a light switch turning off?

Yeah.

So, I feel like there was some study done at one point where like someone who was running one of the guillotines back in the day had a friend who was going to get his head cut off.

And so he and his friend made an agreement that when his head was cut off, he would keep blinking as long as he could to see how long and it lasted for a while.

Wow, what an interesting study back in the days when they had guillotines.

I'm curious.

You have to be really good friends with the person who's doing the study and know that you're about to, you know...

Great thing to have an agreement with your best bud at such a time.

Just keep blinking.

And it was like 10 or 15 seconds.

Wow.

And you were going to say, Cecily, and you thought about what you were going to say?

Yes.

Oh, I was wondering for when your 17th husband dies, playing Chubby Bunny, is he aware that you've had previous marriages in the big past?

Oh, yeah.

But there's nothing.

There's nothing.

and I really just, you know, I wanna live my life to the fullest and my husband's evolved to that.

And I like getting married because of the fun of the wedding, but no, you know, they're never exclusive.

Is there a pressure in the way they go?

Trust me.

For the person like, I don't- Oh, because so many interesting deaths.

Yeah.

Oh, is there a- Yeah, are they trying to top each other in deaths?

That's actually a very good question.

So when I was a world record.

And it's very possible that that's what he was doing.

And he was old, I mean, he's- I'm old, but he was ready to go.

Oh, wow.

Do you have your sights on anyone else?

I mean, I have to say, you were talking about Vin Diesel earlier.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

I've always had my sights.

I'd love to put his boots under my bed.

He's very handsome.

He is being strapping and big.

It's interesting that he's named after the thing that you put into cars.

Yes.

That's what's the most interesting thing about it.

You know what I mean?

And that his first name is on the- The Ville Ville.

The Ville Ville.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah, it's weird.

Yeah.

I wonder if he's a- He's a movie- What's his middle name, Driveshaft?

It's a great question.

We should call him up and ask him.

Hey, Vin, what's your middle name, Driveshaft?

Click.

So, do you think that's achievable or- What?

Vin Diesel.

I mean, for him, it's all about family.

Oh, is it achievable?

Of course, it's achievable.

Yeah.

I've mounted a lot of wonderful men in my days.

Yeah.

I have to ask you something, Scott, do you have any refreshments?

I am parched.

I have some water in front of you.

I have some cookies.

Oh, I would love if you have it just a nice tall glass of butter milk.

Butter milk.

This is one of those old people drinks that I think my grandmother used to drink as well.

I would consider it an old- I just think it's a nice really refreshing beverage.

It's okay if you don't have butter milk.

Yeah.

I will definitely take just a glass of heavy cream.

Yeah.

I don't have either, honestly.

What is butter milk again?

Is it like milk that sour or something?

It's pretty sour.

That is the taste of it.

It's more sour than sweet.

Yeah.

And quite thick.

Quite thick.

It's very thick, but boy does it wet a whistle.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

I have neither of these things.

I'll just keep drinking the water.

Yeah.

That usually quenches thirst way better than butter milk, I would say.

We'll see.

Yeah.

Anything didn't nibble on?

Just these cookies that I hate to brag that I made them.

You did.

Yeah.

Homemade.

I was hoping for a moist yeast bun.

Okay.

I don't even know if this is an old person thing.

It's a yeast bun.

Yeah.

It's just made of yeast and some bun.

I've had a yeast bun before.

I was just saying so.

Yeah.

It was spicy.

I like it.

It was too spicy.

It's not normal for a yeast bun.

I just want some hot sauce in here.

My yeast bun wasn't supposed to be spicy.

I can't lie to me.

My best friend lied to me.

Who did you love the most?

I like Dan's songs here.

Who did you love?

Remington.

Remington was my last husband.

He was in your knife.

He was a hunter?

Remington the sick.

I married two Remington.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Yeah, no, of course.

I didn't make that clear.

I didn't even know one Remington.

And you married two?

I married two.

Yeah.

Remington.

I called him R2.

After R2 D2?

Yeah, that's why.

Because he loves Star Wars.

He loved it.

Boy did he love Star Wars.

Yeah.

How did he die?

He died by a ceiling fan.

Next one, you mean?

I really don't want to get into it.

Oh, that's the one that's still a runner.

Yeah, that was a tough one.

I only saw the aftermath of it.

Oh, it was not a...

You witnessed all the other ones?

Most of them.

Yeah, a lot of them I was there for.

Wow.

Yeah.

But to see R2 is the one you love the most, and the fan was still going.

So, as you can imagine, it wasn't pretty.

Yeah.

The fan got turned off.

Again, says it, please.

I've asked it not to go into this.

I'm sorry.

Beheaded or...

I can't.

Shoved up an orifice.

Just...

Anyway.

Okay, sorry.

No, I'm sorry.

I don't mean to bring a bar, too.

What year was that?

That was in 83.

83?

Yeah.

Okay.

Interesting.

So, Culture Club was on the radio at the time.

Yup.

Culture Club.

That's what was going on.

1983.

Eighty-three.

Return of the Jedi would just come out.

Yeah, R2 was in your heart, but also a Jabba's Castle.

Yeah, in the zeitgeist at the time.

You know?

Yeah.

I don't think you had a castle as much as he had a lair.

You see?

I hate to beekness here with Jabba the Hutt, but it was kind of like an underground cave more than, you know, I view a castle as being a protruding...

A little higher up.

Yeah, a little higher.

Yeah.

Sort of like how the Pantagious is like the bottom of a big art deco building.

What?

I'm gonna have to ask...

What?

I'm gonna have to ask...

Stop!

What?

Why did I say that?

Okay.

Now you're in your head, I feel like.

I feel like I've gotten in your head.

You're free to say whatever you want to say.

Well, Myrtle, this is a terrible story, but you have a great attitude about it.

Oh, I...

You know, life's too short.

It's too short.

It's too short, although in your case it's been really, really long.

And I hope it goes a lot longer.

How long?

Still feel young and vibrant and veer.

Yeah.

How old do you want to be?

I would love to make it to the 120s.

I know it's not common, but I think I have 40 good years in me.

Yeah.

Yeah, Deb, what about the singularity when they upload our consciousnesses into...

Yeah, I'm not gonna do that one.

Oh, you're not doing that?

Why not?

I... I'm just terrified of that.

Is the physical part of being alive what you like?

It's important.

All the physical pleasure.

The pleasure.

Absolutely.

How can you... you can't have it.

You can't make love in the brain, only in the brain.

It's got to also be in the body.

There's like USB ports and stuff.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

The same way.

A USB port can make you smell, can't make you feel the air on your arms.

Well, they don't have arms anymore.

That's what I'm saying.

Don't just don't put my consciousness...

Talk you to the mic of your...

Don't put my consciousness in the singularity, Scott.

That's all.

I hear the worst guest we've ever shared one time.

But you're one of the best guesses, a guest's rather.

Yes, yes.

Thank you so much.

I'm delighted to be...

I just wanted to come on and see if I could, you know, Mingle and meet some people.

And I'm thrilled to be in the room with me strapping young gentleman.

Oh, you consider us to be strapping.

Oh, yeah.

Absolutely.

You know, in your own right.

Yeah.

What does that mean?

You know, I just...

I think everyone is very special.

And I find something good about everyone.

And I am wearing my straps.

I'm here wearing these straps.

All these straps I'm wearing too.

I mean, you gave us nice compliments and then you backtracked and said, well, you find good about everyone and you try to find good about every single person you meet.

That's my help.

I'm struggling to like come up with compliments for us.

I mean, if you really want me to come up with a compliment, I could, but I just thought I'd leave it.

We gave us the compliment of strapping.

I thought I'd leave it in strength, exactly.

And it says, if it may be wearing a lot of straps and we can have...

Yes, yeah.

Yeah.

Could do some fun things with those straps.

Out of them.

Yeah, you're...

It's almost like you're the Hellraiser or something like that.

You have so many...

It's like S&M straps.

We have a Hellraiser suit coming up on the auction block.

Hellraiser's actual suit?

Yes.

Like what the one he got married in?

In universe.

Not what the actor wore, what he got married in.

Pretty married.

Meryl Streep.

He was the lucky groom.

Same on that buy-you.

Interesting.

All right, well guys, we're coming up on a break.

Would that surprise you?

No?

All right.

Well, we're going to take a break.

When we come back, we're going to have more from Dan.

And Dan, you have a song that you're going to play at the end of the show.

This is very exciting.

Yes.

We're going to have more from Cecil, but also Myrtle.

You can stick around, right?

I would absolutely love to.

And we have someone in the lumber industry.

I've never spoken to anyone in the lumber industry.

We just have to be a lumberjack.

Could be.

Speaking of strapping.

Oh boy.

All right.

Strap yourselves in.

We'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang after this.

♪♪♪ Comedy Bang Bang, we're back.

Dan Wilson dancing on the moon is the EP.

People can buy it, I would imagine.

Yeah.

They can buy it, but really they're just going to stream it.

You think?

Yeah.

If they really loved you, they would buy it, don't you think?

No.

Turns out, no.

Turns out, no, but I'm not going to be picky.

Yeah.

I'll take, you know, whatever.

Whatever streams you have.

Look, when you've ridden a number one single, someone like you, the money doesn't even matter anymore, right?

It still kind of matters, I bet.

Yeah, you'd still like more.

Sure.

As much as you make, we still all want more, isn't that right?

Yeah.

We also have Myrtle McGee is here, recent widow.

Yes.

Were you flipping through dating apps during the- Yeah, I might have been swiping right.

You only swipe right.

Yes, so when you're strapping, strapping.

Swiping, strapping, strapping.

My cow me in, cow me in, cow me in.

I'm not selective because that way I make sure that I get, you know, a lot of lovers.

Yeah, fantastic.

We also have Cecil Sotheby is here.

Scott, did you mean when you said I was one of the worst guests you've had lately?

Yeah, lately.

Well, I'm striking lately from that sense.

Well, okay.

All right.

Yeah.

All right.

Well, let's get to our next guest.

They work in the lumber industry.

Very exciting.

I don't believe I've ever spoken to anyone, and we're going to find out if they're a lumberjack or not.

Please welcome to the show for the first time, Cordwood Pete Bunyan.

You called me Cordwood?

That is an insult to my size, Scott.

I came on here.

Oh boy.

I'm sorry.

I thought that that's the information I have in front of you.

My name is Pete Bunyan.

Cordwood is an insult based on my small size.

I'm, someone must have written that down.

Are you sure that you didn't tell my producer?

That's how you wanted to be?

I don't call myself Cordwood.

I am Pete Bunyan.

I, people call me Cordwood because Cordwood's small.

So people do call you Cordwood.

Not to my face.

Or I'll knock their head off.

And pink your part.

I don't know why that's written down in front of me.

I, I'm pink your part.

I'll just call you Pete if that's okay.

That's right Pete Bunyan.

Yeah.

Sorry about the whole Cordwood.

I hated everywhere I go.

My name is, uh, arrives before me.

Well, yeah, that's usually, uh, how it is.

I'm sorry.

But it's an insult.

I'm sorry.

I'm pink your part.

This is, I feel really, really bad.

But I, but you can see why I would just read what's written in front of me, right?

I mean, sure.

If you're, if you, if you don't have any other sense, you're just going to read what you have.

It's the, the first of five senses site.

That's right.

I just, I just, the very first one you develop.

Yeah.

I guess so.

Is that true?

Sure.

But you can't tell because you're still inside a womb.

Interesting.

Well, Pete, I almost called you Cordwood again.

Oh my gosh.

Please don't.

I'm going to, I'm going to go.

Please don't.

I'm going to cross it out.

I'm going to just cross that out.

So I don't ever say it again.

Pete Bunyan, welcome to the show.

Thank you very much, Scott.

Is that your real name, Pete Bunyan?

Yes.

That's my birth name.

Oh, it is.

Great.

Okay.

Because you know there's a famous Paul Bunyan.

Oh, here we go.

I'm sorry.

Is that another insult or?

That's my big brother, Paul.

Oh.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Paul Bunyan, the famous giant.

Yeah.

He's famous.

Oh, well, I mean, I was going to say you're like a six foot four guy.

Yeah.

And you're calling yourself small?

Well, compared to my brother.

Oh, I understand.

He's enormous.

I understand.

I get it now because you're, I mean, you're taller than me and you're talking about strapping.

Well, you're just a human.

Wait, what are you?

I'm a folklore creature.

Oh, so you're a book man.

I haven't read any of these stories.

Oh, you never found my story.

So you probably read all the Paul stories, but none of Pete's.

I did.

I didn't get a one.

That's why I'm so small.

I ate up all the flapjacks.

He ate them.

That's part of the story you don't read is that he just ended up eating.

Pick out all the mala.

They never even mentioned me.

They say it took 20 storks to deliver him the day he was born, but no one talks about the two hummingbirds that brought don't eat.

I mean, that's terrible to grow up in the shadow of a face.

Literally, I grew up in his shadow.

Yeah.

I didn't see the sun until he moved away for college.

Oh, what do you think?

It was so bright.

The reviews are in.

The sun is bright.

I'd only seen it from a distance.

I thought he was blocking it.

Well, I saw between his legs.

I could see a crack of light and I thought someday I'm going to be where the sun is.

Got it.

Wow.

Well, so you are you are a lumberjack in the same tradition as your brother.

Yeah, I am a man of the woods and I am looking for work as a lumberjack.

Oh, you are.

I think I've got some work for you.

Oh, timber.

Number 18.

Yeah, if you know, I wouldn't marry Myrtle though unless you want like a log to fall on you.

No need to marry.

We can just have make a nice love night.

Well, that sounds good to me.

I don't mind your age at all.

I'm much older.

Oh, yeah.

You're like hundreds of years.

Yeah.

I think it's hard to remember.

I'm not sure I was to.

Oh, my.

Well, maybe maybe we were neighbors in the past.

So few people in the 1800s, everyone was neighbors.

Everyone was nearby.

So you're looking for work.

Why don't you have work as my life dream to be a lumberjack?

That's my whole family.

You've never been one up to this point by the time I get to where my brother had already been, he's already chopped down all the trees.

It's just like one swing of his mighty axe.

Yeah, absolutely.

Yeah.

See, is he still with us?

No, he killed himself out in the Pacific Ocean.

He's what?

How did he die?

Well, this is right before the Great Depression.

He sunk all of his money into gold mines because there are no more trees to cut down, but the old.

No, the old Depression?

Yeah.

So the, he never even lived.

Is he the Depression?

No, he lost all of his money first and he killed himself in the Pacific Ocean.

Oh, just by walking into it or?

No, he blew his brains out.

Oh, she's saying why?

How did it first of all?

Because he was broke.

He was the biggest man in the world and everybody loved him, but now he was flipp.

Busted.

I understand that.

My two questions are, why did he walk into the middle of the Pacific Ocean to do this?

And where did he get a huge gun?

Well, he used the same gun.

He used to kill Babe, the blue axe.

Oh, no.

Babe's dead too?

Yeah.

He killed him and sold the hard to get the money that he used to buy the gold mines.

And then he went bust and he couldn't, he wanted to escape the responsibility and shame of financial bankruptcy.

Okay.

So why walk in the middle of the ocean to do this?

So it doesn't make a mess.

I think he wanted to fall and probably kill Indochina with a tidal wing.

He's a violent man.

Why do we lionize this guy?

I don't know.

America loves big macho men.

Yeah.

Well, I, with all due respect, this is one person's perspective.

Perhaps one that's is colored by feelings about one's brother.

We don't know if when Paul Bunyan killed himself, if he necessarily wanted to wipe out Indochina, just devil's advocate.

Yeah.

Well, that's how it seemed to me.

And growing up with him, that is exactly what I think he would do.

Okay, that's fair.

That's fair.

I often mentioned it.

Well, that's a good piece.

Part of the case.

It sounds like he didn't know it was called Indochina at the time.

Yeah.

He just, I bet there's a bunch of people over there and I hope they die when I send away.

Oh my goodness.

So he's making a lot of cries for help.

Yeah, I guess maybe.

No, he's just an asshole.

I don't think he was cries for help.

So you guys weren't close.

No, he was always so far ahead of me.

Yeah.

How did it affect your parents?

Oh, my parents, they died early.

Yeah, giving birth to Paul.

Well, we're mythological.

We don't get born.

We are carried in by birds, storms and down birds in the light.

Yeah.

But yeah, he left.

So you do have parents then?

We did.

They raised us.

Oh, they raised you.

Someone's got to make them big flatjacks.

Good point.

Yeah.

And then when he left to go, he had chopped up all the wood in Maine where we were from and they traveled across the Great Lakes region.

And then my parents died of being lonely.

Oh, man, that's terrible.

But they were together, right?

They were together.

I was there.

Not enough for them though.

It's just that Paul was gone.

They liked him best.

Oh, man.

You know, when you're the parents of a celebrity and then the celebrity dies, they sort of, I believe they wished it was me.

He didn't die.

He just left.

Yeah.

But did you know the Johnny Appleseed?

Oh, yes.

I did.

I know Johnny Appleseed.

Oh, is he still with us?

I don't think so.

I don't think he planted all the apples.

Oh, and that's why we don't have any more apples.

I thought I had one the other day.

Yeah, but those are old apples.

Oh, got it.

Got it.

Yeah.

Notice how you had to go to a doctor's appointment later that day.

They've lost their power.

Oh.

But I also know his brother, Ronnie Applecore, they have different last names.

Yeah.

Oh, interesting.

Yeah.

Why?

Why did they have different names?

Yeah, why did they have different last names?

They have, they serve different purposes.

It's a story thing.

Oh, it's a mythological.

Oh, it's something to do with being part of American folklore.

Yeah.

That's got to be fun, right?

You, John Henry.

Not for me.

John Henry.

He was an impressive man.

Yeah.

He was my one black friend.

I tell you, you don't want to know what I do with his boots.

Oh, really?

John Henry.

Boy.

Oh, didn't that railroad spike with one mighty swing?

Deep under my head.

He hit the bat, you know him?

No, I don't know Casey at the bat.

I don't have much time for baseball.

Oh, OK.

I do.

Lumberjack sports, timber sports.

OK.

Even though he never works as a lumberjack.

Yeah, that's right.

I can't get work as it, but I can do entertainment.

I see.

You can do log rolling.

Well, I don't really do it.

After I watch and I announce and I'm sort of the mascot for the show.

Oh, you do play by play.

A little bit.

And I'm a color commentator because I don't know the technical terms.

I've never worked in the words.

Got it.

And you're the mascot.

You say you're like gritty.

Sort of the mascot.

Everybody, they put signs up.

Cordwood Pete.

Paul Bunyan's little brother.

They put a sign that this is Cordwood, even though you've asked them not to call you.

Absolutely.

And everybody comes and asks me questions.

Tell me about what it's like to live with Paul Bunyan as your brother.

And I don't want to.

I knock their hats off their heads.

Oh, I've been asking you a lot of questions about living with Paul Bunyan as your brother.

You're not going to knock my hat off my head.

I'm going to let you get them all out and knock your hat off once.

I'm going to wait until you're leaving.

Put your hat back on.

I'm going to knock it right off your head.

That makes more sense.

Wow.

Well, Cordwood.

Oh, I mean, I got dang it.

Put the hat on.

All right.

Here you go.

Slap.

Ow.

Pete, this is a terrible story.

Do you think anyone's hiring out there?

I can't find a one.

I walked all the way to Puget Sand.

I didn't find one good tree to chop down.

That's what I walked south from there.

And here I am.

You're not like Paul where you could do that in like three steps.

No, I walked pretty much straight.

And how long did it take you?

Until, let's see, he got there.

Don't just give me the ending.

Like the full amount of time is what I'm looking for.

I got to Puget Sand around the year 2000.

Okay, but when did you start?

1800s.

Oh, okay.

Wow.

Even for 6 foot 4, you were walking pretty slow.

There's a lot of, you know, I read it.

I have to read my tiny donkey.

Oh.

Yeah, well, he's my friend.

He doesn't serve a purpose.

I have a tiny yellow donkey named Tamara.

How tiny?

What do you mean, like?

He's about a foot tall.

Oh, so that's small even for a donkey.

Yeah, I mean, you're a lot of weight for a donkey.

Yeah, he does carry a lot of weight.

He gets tired fast, but he insists that I write him.

I'm going to take a lot of breaks.

He insists that he eats.

Yes, he does.

What does he say?

I think he can't talk.

He's just cute as can be until you ask him to do work.

And then he frowns and falls asleep.

Sounds like he doesn't want you to write him.

I think he does.

All right.

Hey, let's agree and disagree.

Well, this is terrible.

But a call out to the lumber industry, if you're out there and you need and you're looking for anyone to chop down trees, have you ever chopped down an actual tree?

Well, I don't know if it'd be called a tree.

Nope.

It'd be more of a post.

You chop down a post.

I did.

I have chopped down fences that I come across.

Being come across.

Yeah, because I'm walking across the country isn't anybody paying attention to me.

I walk through the wilderness and I go around because then the world should be open for everyone I'm against private land ownership and I think everything should be free.

Are you a you're not a nimby, are you?

What's a nimby?

Not in my backyard.

Oh, thank goodness.

I was thinking of namblah.

Oh, it's please don't.

Not bad.

Please don't think of it.

Don't even think of namblah.

I'll reverse think of it.

Cast it out of your mind.

I'm going to think about old men.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

I don't know if that solves the problem.

What are you who are you thinking about right now?

Joe Biden.

Two of them.

Make an arrow.

Okay.

Well, look, I mean Pete.

You're learning.

He's learning.

I like it.

I didn't say cord would.

I said cord.

Yes.

I think corrected myself.

That's all right.

Sometimes I wear a cord or a pants.

Yeah.

Good.

I'm happy for you.

It's called in the words.

Are those warving to you?

If you move fast enough.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, because they create a friction.

How do they ever find a tailor who can make pants to fit somebody who's six four?

Again, Cecil, I'm going to have to beg of you not to interrupt the show anymore if you're if that's the best you can do.

Well, look, Cecil, we're running out of time.

Are you sad?

Well, I love you too.

No, no, I didn't say that.

We are running out of time here.

We only have time for one final feature on the show.

That is, of course, a little something called plugs.

I'm a secret driver.

Oh, that was CBB.

Ramey Mix by Rupert Holden, I believe, is how that spelled or puppet, puppet Holden.

I think it's Rupert, though.

Thanks so much to Rupert Holden for that wonderful remix.

All right.

What are we plugging?

Obviously, Dan Wilson dancing on the moon available to stream now or to buy.

And it peaks in the middle, apparently, with track three.

But it's the perfect one.

I don't want to discontinue the brave souls who continue on to the end.

The perfect amount if you're taking a drive from like Silver Lake to...

It's the length of an errand.

Yeah.

It's the length of an errand.

An errand back?

No, then you can listen to it again.

On the way back.

Okay, good.

Where I'm from, Minneapolis, it's two errands long in a sense.

Two errands long.

So you get halfway through dancing on the moon and you're where you need to go.

Okay.

I've back having heard the second half of the EP.

Right.

Because things are not as far away.

And are you tailoring this for different states across this great nation of ours?

I love the idea of like, you know, promising that it'll be exactly the length of your errand.

Exactly.

Whatever it is to me to do.

I'll make an album the exact length.

You are not going to be sitting out in the car having to turn it off in the middle of the last song.

No, no, no, no.

It's got a minute you park.

It's going to end.

You used a 200 year long one to get across the country.

That would have been great.

It's a 200 year long song.

Could you even record that?

I guess you, if it were electronic, you could just like.

I mean, you could cut it and paste sections and make it really long.

So yeah, man, you got to do that.

Yeah, just make a few, then a couple hours worth and then yeah, and then just yeah, yeah, cut and paste.

Oh, that would be amazing.

200 years long.

The song might have gotten bored of once you realize it was literally just a lot of.

It was just one minute.

Yeah.

Repeating over and over again.

Fiddles and squeeze boxes.

So I'm using to impress.

Yeah, we have more modern music out there now.

No, I live in the woods.

I haven't paid a name, tension to it.

Okay, great.

Cecil, what do you want to plug here?

Oh, I'm Paul.

What?

I'm Paul Rust.

What?

And all Russ?

Yes, and I am promoting.

We need a good look at you.

Turn around.

Chachachachach.

Hello.

My friend Paul Russ.

I was in the shadows the whole time, Scott.

Why are you pretending to be the Cecil guy?

Where's Cecil?

Sorry, guys.

I did it to amuse you.

We're so disappointed.

Oh, well, I'm here to.

We loved Cecil.

He's gone.

Never to return.

Damn.

We love him.

I made sexual relations with your great grandfather, Terrence, and I wanted to talk about it after the podcast ended.

Oh, my gosh.

He was a legend in his own time.

I had the Sothemy's great great.

Yeah, but I know you're just Paul.

I don't want to talk about it anymore.

I guess Cecil's sort of a story, but creeped your two.

Yeah.

And he's entered so sort of mystical afterlife.

Yeah.

OK, great.

Well, I mean, you can plug something if you want to plug something.

Perhaps I will.

Yeah.

Scott, I am a part of a podcast called With Gourley and Rust, and that's with Matt Gourley.

We discuss horror movies, and I'm also part of another podcast called Soggle Week.

And I do that with Michael Cassidy, and we're in a band called The Stuff Rolled Die.

We do new songs a week.

Oh boy, and aren't you on a Fox television show as well?

Yes.

The third season just started September 25th, the great north on Fox Sunday nights.

Hey, check it out.

It's a really it's a very special funny show.

That's Nick Offerman and Will Forte.

Yeah.

And Jenny Slate.

Yeah.

And your fifth build or eighth build?

Where were how?

What number are you on the call sheet?

I'm much like a mutant duck.

I'm seventh build.

All right.

You put me in a corner and I haven't get out.

So Paul, you're not that much different from Cecil.

I did make the choice in the beginning that Cecil was going to be more subdued.

I know.

That's all you make that choice at the very beginning.

Didn't stick.

All right.

Myrtle McGee.

What are you plugging?

You know, I will say I've been helping reopen a theater in Los Angeles, California called the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre.

Oh, are you the one that painted it that bright color?

I sure did.

Oh, wonderful.

Yeah.

I went out there at night naked and I painted it up with my whole body.

Oh, great.

Yeah.

It was such interesting shapes.

Yeah.

I thought it would be fun new take on things.

Yeah.

So, yeah.

So let's see.

Well, it's October 3rd.

So we just opened and I hope it went off without a hitch.

Great.

Congratulations on the opening.

Yeah.

Come on down here.

You've got shows that shows are going to be planned.

Okay.

Peep onion.

What do you want to plug?

Burning books.

Right.

And then re-printing them on more paper to drive up the demand for wood and paper.

And maybe there'll be more lumber work for me.

Oh.

Also, oh, there's a guy I like.

His name's Charlie McCracken.

I like his name because it sounds like an axe hitting wood.

Huh.

Yeah.

And also he's got a Twitter, the crackin' at the crackin' and that sounds like it's not a lot of lumber stuff but you can check that out.

Sounds like Closet the Titans though.

Yeah.

Release the crackin' all of that stuff.

Yeah.

You can also watch AP by L and PCOT.

Oh, yeah.

Well, about every other episode.

Oh, great.

All right.

Well, I just want to plug.

First of all, we talked about it last week.

We're going to be talking about the show.

We also have three of them over there.

CBB presents.

This book changed my life so much more.

If you subscribe for a year, you get two months free.

That is a pretty good deal.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

Yeah.

Take one hand, put it up.

Take the other, put it down.

You're going to make a box.

It's time to start to close it.

But don't close it.

You're going to make a box.

It's time to start to close it.

But don't close it.

We're opening up that plug bag.

And when you open up that plug bag, you open up your heart for the rest of the world.

I'm talking open up the plug bag.

I open up your shot bag.

You're opening up the plug bag as I as I as you can.

Then you open up your heart.

Open up the plug.

All right.

That was where the plugs have no bag.

Remixed by actually Simpson.

Thank you so much.

And guys, I want to thank you so much.

Paul Rust, you pulled one over on us.

But I still love you, buddy.

I love you too, buddy.

So good to have you on.

And Myrtle McGee.

Wonderful to meet you.

Good luck finding number 18.

I'm on it.

Maybe this one.

Maybe you'll die before this one does.

Oh, I don't think so.

I'm going to live forever.

You think?

Can we just decide to do that?

Well, I said 120.

That's still good 40 years.

I got 40 years.

Halfway through my lovers.

Yeah.

Oh, you're only halfway?

Only halfway.

I'm opening it up that lumberjack here is going to help.

Oh, yeah.

I mean, he is 6'4".

Yeah.

Literally strapping.

Pete Bunyan, aka Cordwood.

Yeah.

He looked surprised that I called you that.

Well, I thought we were done.

Here we go.

I'm back.

Yeah, you're back.

I want to thank you for being on the show.

Well, thank you for having me.

And I hope I get a job from it.

And if I do, I'll give you 10%.

Oh, you know, most of my guests.

Honestly, Dan, I'd like 10% of the EP sales.

Got it.

I mean, now I think about it.

Only prayer.

I should be getting paid when I have people on the show.

Dan Wilson, wonderful to have you on.

Good luck with the career.

So happy to have you back.

And are you ready to do another song?

Yeah.

Okay.

Great.

I don't have to twist your arm or anything, right?

No, I'm happy to do songs.

Yeah.

Great.

Wonderful.

What I'm good at.

Okay.

Well, which one do you want to do here?

I think it's, I don't know.

I think it's appropriate to do closing time.

Oh, yeah.

We're closing the show.

Okay.

What a treat.

I think so.

Dan Wilson with closing time.

One of his most famous songs.

Here we go.
