♪♪♪ Remember me when you fall down, for I was the one that held you in my arms.

Remember me when you take your last breath, for I was the one that held you too tightly in my arms.

Actually, forget me, for I am the one that does not want to go to prison.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

What are you checking your watch for?

That was too long.

It was too long.

And that was an incredibly long intro.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

For another week, thank you to...

Joe Kredacted for that wonderful catchphrase submission.

And welcome to the show.

We have a great one coming up a little later.

We have a mythical...

No, an animated feature star, star of an animated feature.

We have a TikTok star.

Ooh, and a medium.

A medium, wow.

Whoa, indeed.

I've noticed that with these Apple watches, people are always like checking their wrist because they got messages, but it just looks like they're impatient with what you're doing.

That's exactly right.

So it could be both.

Which one was the news alert from Vulture?

Delling me that there's a new...

You got a Google alert, a new interview with you.

That's right.

Because I only get Google alerts about myself.

Just in quotes, Adam Scott interview.

That's right.

Are there any new ones in there?

I need to learn more about myself.

That's right.

That and I want to get the fuck out of here.

Oh, okay.

Great.

All right, well, let's get to it.

He is our guest of honor.

The...

A little show...

He's the star of a lot of shows, but he's going to be a major star on an upcoming show one week from tonight.

Something called the Emmys.

Oh, if you heard of it.

Oh, well, of course I've heard of it.

I myself have been feated.

You have...

How many Emmys do you have?

I have two.

But two Emmy awards.

Yes, you'd need to win two in order to catch up with you.

To equal you, yes, I would.

But he is the star of Severance.

He is the co-star of Parks and Recreation.

He is...

Do you consider yourself an ensemble player and party down?

Yes, I do.

Mm-hmm.

Yes, I do.

He is also my co-host in the podcasts.

You talking to me?

Are you talking to me?

Are you talking to RHCP Rimi?

And also...

Are you talking to my talking head?

Yes, I think so.

Please welcome Adam Scott.

Hello.

Hi, Scott.

Hi, how are you?

How are you doing?

You trying to go quieter than me?

It's just this new thing I'm trying out right now for the next ten seconds.

I like it.

But now it's over.

Oh, oh, boy, you guys are pretty much early.

Ten seconds.

Wow.

It's so good to see you.

We have never done a pre-emmys check-in before.

Never.

See, I can't believe we've never done a pre-emmys check-in.

I know all those times.

It's so weird.

This is what, the 85th or something?

It's the 85th Emmys.

It's the...

What?

83rd Emmys we've been friends for during.

During.

And every year we say to each other, should we do a pre-emmys check-in this year?

Some would consider that to be the pre-emmys check-in.

Let's check in before the Emmys about whether we should do one or not.

But no, it's not too totally different things.

Turns out it doesn't count and we need to do it on air and turn it into half hour of content.

Yeah, exactly.

So do you promise to do this every year from now on?

Oh, 100% percent.

I mean, I can't believe.

Regardless of if you're nominated or not, we need to do a pre-emmys check-in.

Of course.

Even more importantly, if neither of us are nominated.

Sure, yeah.

And what do we do during the check-in again?

Do we make predictions?

Do we get directions?

We make predictions about what people are going to wear.

Okay.

Pants.

About the weather.

Okay.

On the day of the Emmys.

On the actual day of?

Yeah.

We look up the weather.

Okay, let me see what I've got.

And then predict based on that forecast.

Okay, let's see what we got here.

It's Monday, a week, Monday September 12th, I believe.

Yeah, I don't have it that far out at this point.

But if it's trend, it looks to be trending downward.

Well, no, it's in the 90s, the week before 100, full week before.

I don't know.

I'm just going to make this prediction.

If it's as hot as it's been, those tuxedos, you'll be a little hot under the collar.

It's going to be toasty in there.

It's going to be like a making, making a broth or a soup or.

Sure.

Yeah.

And then inside the tuxedos, tuxedos, tuxedos, tuxedos.

Tuxedos.

And it'll be boiling and it'll be delicious.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Carrots, carrots, onions, a chocolate, broccoli.

Yes, we put it in the suit.

And then I say broccoli.

I'm too nervous.

You don't eat broccoli in your beef.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Goddamn fucking moron.

You are of course nominated for the show I mentioned earlier, Severance.

And explain the show for a guy like me who is actively not ever watched a single episode.

Sure.

This is a show that's called Severance.

Okay, that's the title.

Got it.

And you play Jimmy B?

I play Sev Severance.

And the show is about.

Is that a nickname, Sev or?

Sev.

Well, people call me Sev.

Oh, okay, but the name is Sev.

Sev.

Right.

There's a unique nickname.

It needs to be longer.

Just to, you know, when you're writing a show, when you're coming up with a show, Dan Erickson is the creator of the show and kind of writes most of it.

But really you wrote most of it.

I'm not going to say that, but, you know, of course.

No, Dan Erickson conceived of, created and writes the show.

And then he passes it on to you.

And then he passes it to me and I write everything.

But really it's Dan.

Yeah.

So he did.

He's the guy who sits down at the typewriter or the computer.

That's exactly right.

Final draft.

Or process.

Maybe.

Sure.

Yeah.

Any of the above machines, he sits down originally and then he just like.

He sits down at a giant machine.

Right.

And when you're conceiving of and writing an hour long show before he gives it to you.

Before he gives it hands over to me to actually write it.

What you're fundamentally trying to do is eat up time.

That's right.

Because an hour show needs to have approximately 59, 61 minutes of content.

59 to what?

300 minutes.

Sure.

And we're in there in our range is good.

Yes, exactly.

In that amount of time you want to take up as much time as possible.

So if you're doing 300 minutes you want to really do 400.

You need 400 minutes packed into that 300.

Yeah, exactly.

After you expand it out of the.

What's the thing you sent you email?

What are you talking about?

You're doing your miming something.

You're miming.

Never mind.

You're miming like a magic trick right now.

What I'm saying is you want to take up time so that a name like.

Sev you want to take up time.

So you extend it and make sure that it's too.

Because that will take up because people are.

Listen, it adds up.

People are calling you by your first name probably every line, right?

Where did you.

Check your fucking watching.

I have my.

Who cares?

Put your watch off.

Take it off.

I don't want to.

I want to see those bare wrists.

Adam Scott, the barest wrists.

Get your nose out of it.

It's on the table.

Yeah.

So because vice it to say a show is written and then it's extended.

After you figure out how to make the names longer.

Yeah.

That's how you fill an hour.

Also, you should try to say every character's name at the beginning and end of each line.

Every sentence like hey, Sevi.

Hey, Sevi.

Will you come over here and grab that piece of paper?

Sevi.

Sevron.

And then you make it even longer.

Seviron.

Really?

Is that season two?

No spoilers.

But yeah.

Wow.

Sevron.

Congrats, buddy.

Thank you.

This is incredible.

Do you know what song is going to be played?

Do you happen to win the Emmy?

Do you know what?

Because everyone gets to request it.

It's like a baseball game, right?

Where you get to request what song goes up.

Yeah, you put it out.

And it's interesting you say that because mine is take me out to the ball game.

Interesting.

So Adam Scott for Severance.

Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

And the whole audience is going to stand up and sing.

Five years on me, nuts and cracker jack.

That's right.

Amazing.

Wow.

Now, just to be clear, because I saw you, you've gotten a few messages about this recently.

Our agreement regarding your speech, if you win an award, only pertain to the Oscars.

Only the Oscars.

And I have heard about this quite a bit in the last couple of months.

And if you do win an Oscar, what exactly are you going to be saying?

That's a really good question.

But I know that- You promised.

I promised that I don't remember what I would say.

And the thing that I've been reminded of several times is that I take the award and stick it up my butt.

No, that's what you said you would say on stage.

I'm going to stick this up my butt.

Thanks to the Academy.

I'm going to stick this up my butt and then stick it up my butt.

Yeah.

Well, I mean, if you do it or not.

Is that the agreement?

That's the agreement.

Is that you would say it?

Oh, but there is no- There's no actual physical agreement that we made.

Oh, that was understood.

Well, that's a relief.

Not that I'm any closer now than I was at the time of the agreement.

Although you are in Madam Web coming up very soon.

That's true.

Madam Web, she spins webs any size.

We just saw you in Boston on the tour.

Yeah, that was fun.

That was a fun, fun.

Thank you so much for talking about me.

There's a live audience right there in front of us.

Yeah, we decided to do with a live audience.

Yeah.

When did you get back from that tour?

Less than 24 hours ago.

So 23 hours?

23 hours?

59 minutes.

Oh, wow.

So you just got back right.

Yeah.

And 24 hours ago.

Oh, okay.

So now it's been 24 hours.

Yeah, it's been 24 hours.

How was it feel to be back for 24 hours?

Oh, man.

It feels so good.

I packed so much in.

I went laser tag.

I surfed in the morning and I went skiing at night.

Okay.

And you packed all of that into this last 24 hours.

Yeah, that's the great part about living in California.

Yeah, you can do everything.

You can ski and surf all in the same day.

Parachute jump.

You can parachute jump any day.

Yeah.

I'm talking about a day in Los Angeles.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah.

You can go star in a movie and then you can also win the lottery.

Win the lottery?

Yeah, the California win in California wins the lottery eventually.

Yeah, I don't know why more people don't move here.

It's crazy because every time someone wins the lottery here, it's what?

Like $2 billion?

Yeah, something like that.

Now, every ticket costs $3 billion.

$3 billion.

Yeah, so it's a total, total $3 billion.

It's a sham, but it works for us.

We're Californians.

We don't know any better.

We love it here.

This is what we do.

You're, of course, the boy from Santa Cruz who started out hawking Taffy and now you are going to be up there in the shiniest tuxedo we've ever seen, hoping to win one of those golden, golden statues.

It's a tuxedo made of mirrors.

That's right.

It's the, now you were telling me before the show, it's the original disco ball from Saturday Night Fever that they turned into a tuxedo.

Is that right?

Yeah, incredible.

Yeah.

I got in touch with John Batham and I was calling him about stakeout because that's one of my favorite movies.

And then we got to talking and it turns out, director, Saturday Night Fever.

You had no idea that way.

You were just interested in stakeout.

But I was calling about, I was calling about another stakeout.

So how did this come up?

How did Saturday Night Fever come up in this conversation?

Because I was, I was listening to disco music while I was on the phone.

And was it Saturday night?

It was Saturday night.

I had a fever.

Yeah.

Did you have COVID?

I didn't have COVID.

No.

Oh, okay.

Which is lucky because I am not vaccinated.

Oh, okay.

Nor will you ever be?

Absolutely not.

But how I was your fever, like 160?

It was 112.

Which I hear is high.

That's too high, probably.

You want to get that down.

It was fine.

Yeah.

And so that just came up, hey, speaking of, you said Saturday, you said it's night.

Because you were talking about the movie.

I have the fever and I'm listening to disco.

Right.

He's like, I happened to direct something where all of these interests converge.

That's right.

A little movie called Saturday Night Fever.

Yeah.

Starring the disco dancing devil.

Mr. John Travolta.

And what did you say to that?

I said, do you still have the disco ball from that movie?

And he said, yeah.

And then I hung up on him because I was like, this conversation is going nowhere.

But then a few days later, I was like, what if we take that disco ball and construct a tuxedo primarily out of the mirrors?

Did you have to call him back or?

I called him back.

Oh, that's nice.

Yeah.

And did he send it to you, COD?

Or how did you get this?

It ended up being this kind of protracted negotiation that went on for a while.

Oh, okay.

Because he did not want to let it go.

Well, sure.

But where did he keep?

Was it like in his living room or?

He has a Saturday Night Fever room.

Oh, okay.

And his estate and it's beautiful.

It has everything from the movie that you would ever want.

Like what?

The disco ball.

Sure.

From the movie is there.

It was great.

He has John Travolta's shoes.

Whoa.

From the main dance from the movie.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Or they're, well, however they look at a little scuffed up or they're scuffed up, but they're kept in a kind of acetate case.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

That's great.

They look great.

Are those the only two things?

The one disco ball.

Just go ball hanging down from the ceiling.

Hanging from the ceiling and then a pair of shoes and a glass.

And a kind of thing.

A case.

Wow.

The rest of the room, it's completely empty.

And how?

Okay.

Wow.

It's a huge room too.

It's like two football fields.

Two football fields.

This is the Saturday Night Fever room.

That's about 600 feet.

Well, it's certainly 200 yards.

Wow.

Yeah.

So, so, so, I mean, he only has two of those feet in the two shoes.

Two shoes.

And if you, if you, if you, John Travolta actually uses three shoes.

Oh, he does?

Yeah.

He favors his right side.

No wonder he could dance so well.

That's right.

So, you always have a spare right shoe at the ready because, you know, his idea.

Because his idea is stamping on.

Yeah.

Incredibly well.

Yeah.

Well, that's great.

Thanks.

And of course, Olivia Newton-John is no longer with us.

That's true.

She was not in that movie.

No.

But she knew John Travolta.

They're good friends.

They're very good friends.

Yeah.

It's super sad.

So sad.

But we all have to go sometime.

Are you okay?

I'm not sure.

You've only been in town for 24 hours.

I got all my entertainment news right when I landed the plane.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

So you flew yourself.

You fly your own.

Yeah, of course.

Yeah.

You were in John Travolta.

Yep.

We both heard about it the minute he was in the plane with me.

Oh, God.

And we both heard about Olivia Newton-John the second that I landed the plane.

He was my co-pilot.

Oh.

You guys didn't hear about it till today?

We didn't hear about it till 24 hours and four minutes ago.

Oh, and we're so sad.

Oh, God.

No wonder you're broke up.

Sorry.

Anyway, but so the Emmys, obviously the countdown to the Emmys is underway and seven days hence.

That's right.

And you do you get to invite your entire family?

Are you flying solo?

What are you doing?

Yeah, they give you one ticket.

That one ticket you can, as far as I understand it, you can bring like 40 people.

Wow.

So they're just, this is what I'm guessing.

You're plus-sorting.

That's what it is.

Yeah, bringing 39 people.

Right, right.

Who are you, who you got?

I don't know.

I haven't even.

You haven't been thinking about it yet.

You know, there's a guy right here right in front of you.

Would you like to go?

I'd love to go.

Yeah.

We know 38 more people that might be interested in.

I know.

I see if I can count how many people I know.

There's Froderick.

Oh, Froderick.

He can come.

Okay.

Yeah, that's one.

Or she.

Or they.

They.

Fine.

Welcome to the 21st fucking century.

Sorry.

Froderick.

They can come.

That's how many was that?

Well, it's me, you.

Right.

So that's two.

Yeah.

And there's a 40 people total.

Right.

How many do I mention?

You said Froderick.

And you said they could come.

Yeah, so that's they're available.

Right.

And then that's at least 47.

47 more people.

37, I think.

37?

Yeah.

You're going the other way.

You're going up.

Yeah.

Sorry.

That is spam risk, apparently.

Oh, my friend's spam risk is trying to answer because he might want to come.

Oh, let me see here.

Mr. Risk.

Hello.

How you doing?

Hey, I'm an.

Extra tickets for the family.

You got extra tickets?

No, I heard you got extra tickets.

Dumb shit.

Oh, sorry.

Yes.

I have.

Let's see.

Well, right now.

How many you got?

I got it's Scott, myself.

Froderick.

They're coming.

Froderick's coming.

Nice.

So that leaves 37 more people.

How many do you need?

I know probably 36 guys named Bill.

36 guys named Bill.

Yeah.

Okay.

Great to talk to you.

Hey, why did you put the phone down?

Pick it back up.

I thought the call was.

I got a camera on you right now.

Shit.

There's a camera there.

Yeah.

Hidden camera show.

Mr. Risk, you are always getting me.

You're always getting the best of me.

Call me spam.

I love you.

You have the best prank show on the internet.

I really do.

I love you.

Uh, when you come over later.

What for?

I'm having a birthday party.

You're having a birthday party?

It's your birthday?

No.

Oh, is that one of your pranks?

It's bill number 13's.

Oh, okay.

Bill 13.

All right.

Yeah.

Bill 13's having a birthday.

Would you come over?

Sure.

I'll come over.

I want you to meet all the bills before we go to the Emmys.

That'd be great.

Are they all over your place?

They're all over here.

Yeah.

I can't wait.

I'm on by.

Uh, okay.

You get this one.

You get, okay.

Two.

You get this?

Okay.

Are you writing this down?

Yeah, I'm writing it down.

Wait, let me start over one.

One.

Two.

You get this?

Yeah, I'm getting it.

Okay.

Bill, where are you from?

Where do you think I'm from?

I don't know.

It sounds like you might be from like your momma's pussy.

Jesus Christ.

Oh, God damn it.

He's hilarious.

He's so fun.

I think that takes care of our problem.

So I'll see you on Monday.

Okay, so we've spent all of the...

All the tickets.

That's great.

Oh shit, what about your family?

Well, they have a TV, so I'm assuming they can just watch.

Do you bought a TV?

I have a TV now, yeah.

Congratulations.

Thanks.

It's really small.

Oh.

Wait, are you just talking about your phone?

My phone.

Yeah, this is a TV, right?

Do you recommend everyone watch Severance on their phones?

I think that's the best way to experience it 100%.

Because it's great.

Yeah, best like while you're driving.

Yeah, of course.

Watch it on your phones.

Of course, of course.

Because it's fun to watch TV on something that's been so close to your penis.

It's great to watch something that's been close to your penis and it's great to watch something on something that's like scratched up and might have cracks in it.

Yeah, exactly.

Well, good luck to you, Adam.

This is an incredible achievement.

This is your first nom.

My first nom.

And first of many, I hope.

No, no.

Yes, many hamburgers to you, of course.

Thank you, many hamburgers to you.

Yes.

And we need to get to our next guest.

Oh, I can't wait.

Yeah, that's great.

Yeah.

Does that cover everything about the Emmys that we want to talk about?

I think so.

Yeah, it was okay.

Great.

All right, well, let's get to our next guest.

I mentioned that we have an animated character on the show.

Wow.

That's exciting.

Yeah, who's your favorite animated character?

Oh, boy.

This is incredible, am I right?

Oh, she's great.

She's great.

Wait, what are you saying, exactly?

You know what I'm saying.

No, I don't know.

I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

She is very adamant.

Hot stuff, is that what you're saying?

Huh?

Are you trying to say that she's hot stuff?

She stretches around.

She saves people.

Yeah.

In need?

Oh, okay, because it sounded...

Oh, man.

Stop trying to get me canceled.

What does that mean?

What does one mean?

Oh, man.

What does that mean?

It means that I have sincere admiration for her.

Oh, okay, great.

Yeah, the same way the brotherly love.

The same way that I love the same way you say that about me is fun.

Yeah, of course.

How about, I think, my favorite animated character, Jiminy Cricket.

Oh, when you wish upon a star, you're like, great.

He's just a little grasshopper and he has so much to say.

So much wisdom in such a tiny, tiny body.

Little guy.

Little guy, but a big heart.

Huge.

Almost too big.

Almost like...

It's a condition.

It is too big.

It's too much to ask.

He might die soon.

Yes.

Yeah.

Well, we have a great animated character here coming up.

First time on the show, let's welcome him.

This is Olaf's middle part.

I think very much scold for having me or giving me this opportunity.

Yeah.

Hey, it's great to see you.

This is Adam Scott of Severance.

Hi.

Mr. Scott as well.

Thank you.

Yeah, two Mr. Scott.

Scott and Scott.

Yes.

That's funny, right?

First off, I should say I am Olaf's middle part.

I am not the funny head.

A lot of people think that I have a light.

The whimsical, you know.

I feel still listening to you more of the tolla paths.

I'm not Olaf.

Yeah.

When I booked you on the show, I heard Olaf from Frozen was going to be on the show.

And I assumed it was that whimsical.

He's so funny.

He's like, ah, help me.

Hilarious.

What does he say all the time?

He's getting out of my way.

Yeah.

Hey, you're in my way too much.

Get away.

Try to beat me.

I do not recall that.

That catchphrase.

But any any does.

Dennel Knight.

Yeah, yeah.

It's super funny.

Hey, hey, hey, but.

But yeah, he has different.

I'm not a fan of Olaf's personally.

Really?

Aren't you a part of Olaf?

You're the middle snowball.

Is that what you are?

I am the middle snowball.

The torso.

You can call me Tor or Om.

Olaf's middle part.

Om.

Olaf's middle part.

Wouldn't that be law?

Because Olaf, the LA is the middle part of Olaf?

I'm the middle part of the body.

Are you making a joke?

Because I'm not an officer.

I'm sorry.

We apologize.

Olaf's middle part.

I apologize for Scott.

And I apologize for Scott.

And I had nothing to do with that joke.

Yeah.

Yes.

You wrote it.

I mean, I wrote it.

But before the show.

Yes.

You prepared to insult me before the show?

I mean, we brainstormed some stuff we might say.

Just things to rib you with.

It was, yeah.

The way it came out of Scott's stupid reading, it ended up sounding like an insult.

I'm sorry.

How would you have said it?

I would have said it exactly right.

And it would have been gentle.

It would have been funny.

It would have been good-natured.

Okay.

Yeah, I understand.

You were like Olaf.

You're all, your types are always on.

You're always on.

I get to hit the end.

I mean, but I want to come on yourself, Scott, to be honest.

To separate myself from Olaf and let people know that we snowmen, we are three different parts.

It looks like you've already separated yourself already.

I mean, how did you get a- Literally, yes.

Yeah.

How did you get away from the top part and the bottom part?

Well, that happens quite frequently.

If you've seen any of the frozen movies, a lot of the big laughs come from Olaf.

He runs into a tree, a pole, and we separate in three parts.

And I'm blind at that moment.

Oh, you only have a visual sense of a sight when you are physically tethered to the top part?

Yes.

I can like my arms, the leg antennae, so I can sense people around and see things that way, but not like Olaf's eyes.

Right.

If you can understand it that way.

Yeah, I think so.

And those moments of separating were always great moments of fear for me.

I mean, we as an audience are always laughing at this.

But it's scary for you.

I never really thought about it.

For the bottom part in the middle part, it is disconcerting to say the least.

It's a moment to imagine yourself being separated in the three parts.

Yeah, I mean, I guess parts having their own essence and becoming their own entity.

I never thought of it.

Yeah, I guess if you were to cut Adam off right beneath the titties and then maybe at the knees, is that the ratio usually?

I think it'd be, did you say beneath the titties?

Yeah.

I think about the titties.

Above the titties?

Oh, is it just head or?

Well, my arm is kind of where your stomach is.

So it's not analog here, but my arms come out of my stomach or as yours come out of your shoulders.

That's right.

The arms are quite low.

It's just a perfect circle.

Are those made of twigs again?

Or are they?

I can't remember.

They're both pieces of wood.

Yes, they're both pieces.

They're not just mere twigs now.

Oh, okay.

They're pieces of wood.

And are those pieces of wood another part of Olaf?

Do they have their like, yes, they'd be separated?

Yeah.

If you've seen the movies many times I'll have an arm ripped out of my torso and that is also done for laughs, by the way.

Is it painful though?

Yes, of course it is.

Of course it is.

I can only imagine ripping one of my arms off.

Can you?

I mean, I can't really.

Because you don't have Elsa's magic to repair it later.

That's right.

I rely on Elsa's magic.

Most snowmen rely on magic or the love of children to stay whole.

Is she?

I mean, the further you get away from Elsa, is the magic fade?

No, she has a permanent cloud above me that flutters snow.

But if I can still die.

Oh.

Yes.

Of old age or of what?

Well, you idiot.

Of old age.

So you can't die of old age?

No, I'm melt.

That's the only way to kill you?

Have you not seen it?

I've never heard of any snowman dying of old age.

It's always melting.

It's always a brutal quid.

There's no quid.

No, that's the way we don't have to worry about this.

Like a little piece of coal or whatever that is inside one of the snowballs.

The worst thing that can have a close snowman is to be pissed on by a gang.

Oh, gang.

Good Lord.

Oh my.

A gang pisses the most brutal way for a snowman to die.

Okay.

Just jets of piss going through your heart to imagine that sounds terrible.

Yeah.

Well, God willing that won't happen to you.

But I have Elsa to repair that if that ever happens.

If a lumberjack accidentally pisses on me, I give Elsa a call.

You have to give her a really.

So it doesn't automatically do it.

You have to physically.

I have to call her.

She's busy.

But you know, she's nice.

She's a nice woman.

I like her.

I don't like her a lot.

Yeah.

So Olaf, you consider Olaf to be the head.

He is the head.

He's an asshole.

That too.

Right now.

That's a joke.

See?

Yeah.

What about the bottom?

Are you?

It's funny.

Yeah, it's.

It's funny.

He's a head, but he's an asshole.

That's a good one.

Yeah.

What about the bottom part?

That part.

Well, this is interesting.

I've been the only torso.

And of course Olaf has been the main head.

There's been about 20 bottoms.

20 bottoms?

Were there other heads?

Like drummers.

There was an early head.

You say the main head.

There was an early head.

An draft, but there was never used.

So yes, it's been the old out there.

It's an early draft.

Olaf had my torso and many bottoms.

Bottoms, they, you don't remember many scenes, which is the bottom.

Right, yeah, they come and go.

I can only imagine.

But the head is really the star, the money maker.

I disagree.

I think a lot of emotion is in justiculation of arms.

Any Jewish actor would tell you that.

I guess.

Yeah, Adam.

Should we be watching severance to see your arm acting?

Or are you a hands and pockets guy, mainly when you're acting?

I try and find as many opportunities possible to just stick those suckers right in the pockets.

You don't have to worry about that.

That's the thing.

Anytime a camera's on me, I'm so self-conscious.

Just stick them right in there.

I don't know if pockets I go right into the middle.

Is science correct?

Science field suggested drinking coffee, always sipping from a coffee.

Is that why they set that at the coffee shop?

Yes.

Aw, man.

Cheaters.

Again, Phil's time.

Yeah, that's true.

I tried that on a few takes and spilled coffee on myself and melted myself in half.

So that's not good.

I would imagine that the success of Frozen has changed your life.

Are you recognized on the street?

Never.

Not unless I'm with Ola.

Yeah.

This is annoying.

Yeah.

This is embarrassing, but I'll tell a story.

I was in love.

I had a crush on a sample slushy at a hot dog cart.

I wasn't even sure if it was real, but I saw it every day.

It was a sample that they never gave away.

I think it might have been made of plastic.

Oh, oh, God.

It's not like old cheese.

But...

But you loved her.

I loved her.

I saw her.

And I never could work up the competence to say anything.

And one day I did, I went up to the cart.

And when the cart wasn't looking, I talked to the smoothie sample.

And I said, hello.

You look lovely today.

And they glistened in the sun.

You didn't say anything.

And then I said, you recognized me.

Nothing.

But to be fair, did the samples slushy ever say anything?

No.

Ignored me the entire time.

It just goes to me every time I came back as well.

So it might not have been actually alive, per se.

That is true.

But there's a lot of ice that doesn't have magical powers, that can't talk or walk around.

So I give them a break.

Yeah.

That's got to be tough to...

I mean, you're the only one of your kind in a way, the only one of your race.

That's not true.

Oh, really?

There are other...

I mean, there's...

There's many magical snowmen.

Frosty.

All his kids.

The snowman.

Oh, yeah, the snowman.

Yeah, Mr. Police.

I gave you all the clues.

Rain...

Well...

What?

The movie, The Snowman, right?

Oh, no, the book by Raymond Briggs, The Snowman.

Oh, I don't read books.

Or are you talking about the Michael Fassbender movie?

Of course.

Sorry.

It's crazy that I...

A lot of the snowmen go to that movie and are very disappointed.

Speaking of someone with a big hog who, if he pissed on you, you wouldn't need a gang in that situation.

Go ahead, speak of it.

Is he one of Snowman's biggest fears when Michael Fassbender...

I mean, when that movie was announced, I'm sure all snowmen were so scared.

Someone with such a huge hog.

I guess we do not like penises.

Any kind, especially a horse penis.

Oh, yeah.

That's gotta be scary.

So...

Why did you look at Mr. Scott when you said that?

I guess just...

But you didn't look...

It seemed weird.

Yeah.

I mean, you mentioned horse penis.

You mentioned horse penis.

Penises, I automatically look over at him just...

And I know he's looking at me in that moment.

I'm sick of it.

So there's plenty of opportunity for you to date.

There's all of Frosty Kids.

Frosty's Kids.

I do not need magical.

That's my point.

I can date an icicle if it has a nice form.

Right.

Okay.

Yeah.

Even if they don't talk and they're not alive.

Yes.

I think humans are the same way.

Yeah.

I mean, like...

Trophy wives, it's the same.

You don't mean actual trophies because Adam's about to win one.

I wanted to fuck a trophy.

I understand I empathize.

If I had the icicle, the shape of an Oscar, I would be into that.

That would be cool.

An icicle in the shape of an Oscar.

That would be really cool, wouldn't it?

I wonder if they've thought of that yet at an after party.

I don't think so.

Probably.

We should copyright it.

So what's going on?

Why are you in LA?

Do you mind just asking?

Well, I'm always auditioning.

But...

Without Olaf?

Yes.

I do not need Olaf.

But does Olaf need you?

Does Olaf get parts without you guys?

Or...

Well, I'm thinking Olaf probably doesn't even need to audition anymore.

Yeah.

Olaf or only?

That was a good one.

I do like...

I do like puns.

I have to give it up for that one.

Very good snowman love puns like that.

Yeah.

So you're just auditioning out there.

What kind of roles are you auditioning for?

Well, I did get in the new season of the Mandalorian, there is a scene I'm in where Grogu uses the force to throw a chunk of ice, which is me, at Darth Vader.

And then, you know, you start to go through the new season.

And you start to go through the new season.
