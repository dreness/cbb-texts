Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Ah, thank you to Erbicide Detective for that catchphrase submission.

Thank you to Erbicide Detective for that wonderful catchphrase submission.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang, indeed.

We are deep into...

October.

Probably the spookiest month.

Ooh.

Ah!

Ooh.

Who's that?

He's got me shimmy.

Shimmy, what are you doing here?

I'm just lost in the studio.

You still lost?

Yep.

I got relossed.

This is a spooky month to be lost.

Oh, I know.

Okay, Shimmy holds great to see you.

Okay, bye.

Great.

Wow, shimmy.

What is it?

What a big app.

Starting with a drop?

Starting with Shimmy.

Thanks to Erbicide Detective.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Oh, yes, thank you, Erbicide Detective.

Yes, and...

But we're going to need your badge and gun.

It's wonderful to have you back here for Comedy Bang Bang.

My name is Scott Ockerman.

I'm the host of Comedy Bang Bang, and you know this voice next to me.

He has returned to the studio for a second episode if you can believe it.

Can you believe it?

Especially during the spookiest month of all, second only to December.

It is haunting in here.

With all those ghosts.

Ooh.

Christmas past Christmas.

I mean, it is, you know, not a lot of people know, but the earwool studios here in Hollywood California are notoriously haunted.

Notorious.

We saw Duran Duran recently.

We went to Duran Duran.

We were there.

We were in the room where it happened.

That's true.

But it is...

Not the room where they wrote all of their songs.

Exactly.

We were not in that room.

Duran Duran did write Notorious at the Hollywood.

That's all they were like, we need a song that will rock this place.

But what a lot of listeners might not know is that we are in one of the most haunted buildings in Los Angeles, California.

That's true.

That's because so many people have died right here.

That's right.

So many bits have died.

So many dead bits.

So many dead characters.

Yes, sir.

R-I-P.

My...

Who's, who's taught to me again?

My cousin.

My nephew.

My nephew, right.

Been a while since Todd's been on the show.

I don't really remember.

Been a while.

Hey, Jimmy, you're back.

Hey, sorry.

Do you see Shmee?

I said Shmee.

I love this guy.

Do you know Shmee?

Oh, I thought it was like Peter Pan.

Like Peter Pan, yeah.

Do you know Shmee?

Yeah, you know Shmee.

You're dead with O.P.

Yeah, you're dead with O.P.

All right, gotta go and see you later, Shmee.

Later, Shmee.

Wow.

Shmee, incredible to have it back.

It's so great to just be, you know, and that's the thing.

You just can't...

You miss that over Zoom.

You do.

You truly...

You know what would be great?

He was lost in my backyard.

He was in the backyard.

But there is something wonderful, but also concerning about Shmee being stuck in the building for all that time.

What are you up to?

This is Jason Manzukas.

Have I introduced you?

You haven't, but that's okay.

Here he is.

You know him from the How Did This Get Made podcast?

That is the...

Thank you for the one time you've pronounced it correct.

Or you used the correct emphasis.

Correct emphasis, yes.

And you know him from the league and playing scumbags of all stars and stripes.

Oh, to people of all stars and stripes.

This is the spookiest month.

I am terrified.

I wish I had Halloween plans.

What did you do the pandemic for Halloween?

Did you put out candy or no?

No, no.

I turned off all the lights in my house and I just threw balloons full of my own piss at people.

Get out of here.

Hey, at least it was your own piss.

You didn't have to go or collect any one of those.

Even the pandemic, I'll say it was very hard to collect piss.

It was so hard to do my rounds, but I'm glad that I'm getting back in the swing of it.

Anyway, so last Halloween I didn't do much of anything.

This Halloween I have no real plans.

We will be doing How Did This Get Made shows just prior to Halloween, so I'm not sure what I've got going on.

What about you?

Will you be dressing up?

Will you be...

Well, Halloween is Monday, so we'll put that out an episode.

Okay.

That's the only plan I have.

Live?

Will you do a live Halloween episode?

Oh, God, how horrible would that be?

You should do a live stream.

A live stream.

Zoom episode where anybody can trick or treat to the door.

Oh, that is a great idea.

And pop on.

If I had any ambition to do anything like that, that would be a wonderful idea.

It would be.

It would be fun.

You can see all your fans would dress up in crazy outfits related to people who could dress up as their favorite.

Well, you're saying the fans can trick or treat?

Yeah.

No, thank you.

I can't see somebody who could dress up like me.

Oh, shit.

Classic Charles?

No, I can't see.

Oh, my God.

Charles is dead, too.

All the droppin'.

Yeah.

Wow.

I'm lost in the studio.

You know, there's another guy lost in the studio.

There's a...

Wait, he's real?

You should team up that.

That's Jimmy.

I was losing my mind.

Well, that's the real guy.

There are ghosts, though, so you're right to...

No, no, no, no.

You're both a...

You're a ghost.

Am I?

I don't know.

Let me stick you with this sword.

Hey, yo.

Hey, you must be used to it.

You're a fencing instructor.

Yeah, but my kids suck.

I'm the instructor.

I'm not used to getting stabbed.

You've never been stabbed by one of the kids.

No, I'm a bad teacher.

All right, see you later.

All right, bye.

Wow.

Hey, Jimmy.

I thought, oh, they found each other.

Oh, good.

Oh, that makes me happy.

It makes me sad to think of them both lost alone inside.

Thinking the other one is a ghost.

Yeah, thinking the other one is a ghost.

Hey, you see Charles?

Hey, Jimmy.

Do you not see him?

He was here second ago.

He was.

He just said, I love you.

Wow.

I did think for a moment that we were just finding out that classic journals was a ghost that and sixth-sense style, he might not have known it.

Oh, that's true.

Yeah, maybe.

In which case, we would have had to solve a murder.

But he left, so we can't.

And you stabbed him and he felt it.

Oh, that is true.

Yeah, he did feel it.

That was the test.

As far as I was concerned, that's where that bit died.

The potential for that bit.

Jason, thanks.

Scotty.

Thanks.

Oh, man.

Wouldn't that be great?

You a turkey eater?

What?

Are you a turkey eater?

I'm running out of questions.

I talked to you all the time.

This is sad.

I'm running out of professional questions.

We could just right now do our famous, never desired and unasked for comics.

Discussions.

No one wants that at all.

You're right.

When I was on the recent comedy bang bang tour a month and a half ago or so, everyone at the show, they raised their hand.

The first they would say, by the way, I don't want to hear that comics podcast you keep talking about.

And then they would ask their question.

So I just, I wanted to let you know.

Comics related.

We are just some weeks away from the cancellation of paper girls, which I am still grieving.

Yes, I'm so sorry about that.

I'm furious.

So if you're out there and you want, please watch it on Amazon.

Get on your social media.

Hey, yell at people for canceling it.

And write and direct your own sequels to it.

Your own season.

Fan sequels.

I would love to see fan.

And you'll be in them.

I'll be in it.

Yeah.

Call my agent.

The French TV show.

No.

You'll be in the sequel to Call My Agent.

Call these for Thorne.

Call the show.

Decks for Thorne.

Okay, sure.

But you got anything on the horizon coming up that you're here to promote?

What?

I don't know, Jason.

I'm out of question.

Scott, we are in the first act.

We're in the preamble to the show and you're already doing plugs.

I'm so...

Look, you are...

This is the second time you have shown up absolutely checked out.

You are done.

It's over, baby.

I'm sorry.

Look, I mean, I never expected you would ever be back in the studio here.

So you don't have to try?

Exactly.

You're incentivizing me to never come back.

So you're saying you'll never come back?

Wait, do you not want me to show?

You just like perked up.

Even if I pass away, you'll never come back.

Scott, is it working?

Wait a minute.

Closet Jules.

Shut up, Jules.

Shut up.

I may have told Jules about this before the show.

Wow, wow, wow, wow, well, well, isn't this rich?

As Jack and Jill said, well, well, well.

How does the rest of it go?

Me too, went up the hill to fetch a pail of water.

Jack fell down.

Yeah, they said it.

He said it.

I like that.

You just run it in your mind.

Is it Jack and Jill?

What if the hill is or is it?

What if the many, many musical performances that you participated in?

What is your favorite role that you got to embody?

I feel like- What are you talking about?

When you were a musical theater- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Of the many musical performances that I got to get?

Sorry.

When you were performing in musical theater, what character did you feel like you really got?

You know, when I did Curly in Oklahoma, my mom came to see it and she said, wow, this is the first time I've ever ever seen you do a play where it looked like you meant what you were saying.

So I think maybe that one.

So it has nothing to do with you in your own instincts.

This is solely because your mom said yes.

I do think that in that one, my teacher suggested that anytime anyone else was talking, I'd be connecting my previous sentence with whatever I wanted to say in my head.

Sure.

So instead of just waiting for the other person to stop talking and then do the thing.

So that may have been a very- And was that when you started to figure out building a character was more than just saying the lines and that your performance- No, I still hadn't figured that out.

Your performance as Curly was essentially Curly from the Three Stooges?

I did get a perm for that role, strangely enough.

Hey, I got a question.

Jimmy, your back?

Yeah, man.

What did that mean?

Can I make the previous sentence?

So like if one of my lines were, you know what?

I got to tell you something and then the other person says, Curly, I don't have time for you to tell me something.

And then I say, I'm trying to tell you I love you.

This is not a one- Let's do that.

Okay.

So when I say I got to tell you something, then the other person is saying, I can't tell you what I'm saying.

Should I be the other person?

Okay, and I'll tell you what I'm thinking.

This is going to explain it to me.

I'll tell you what I'm thinking in my head.

Look, I got to tell you something.

Tell me what you need to tell me.

I'm trying.

Fuck it.

You blew it.

You fucking blew it.

It's been 30 years.

You jumped all over me.

Jimmy, I'll steal it.

Jimmy, does that help?

Does that clarify it?

For the final time, you got to go.

Jimmy didn't even know what it- Oh, message received.

Jimmy didn't even want to try and figure out how to do this bit successfully.

What do you have coming out?

You said you've been working.

Are you doing a sequel to infinite?

Oh, boy.

Mark Walberg.

Well, you know, is it a sequel if it is in fact a spin-off movie about my hit character, The Artisan?

The Artisan.

I forgot.

Oh, yeah.

The Artisan.

Never forget the character who's only named The Artisan and referred to as The Artisan.

Were you a killer in that?

I'm trying to remember anything you did or read just a new- I'm the mad scientist.

You're a scientist.

I'm like more than mad scientist who they go to.

Oh, it's very convoluted.

Who they go to to kind of revive Mark Walberg's memories from him?

Right.

You know?

How long has that stay up on Paramount Plus, do you think, or do they at some point they just like silently go like, let's get rid of it.

They're going to get rid of it?

That's what HBO Max did with a lot of their films.

Well, yeah, they did that as tax write down stuff.

Sure.

I don't think they can do that with this movie.

They can't do it for just quality purposes.

This is a very expensive movie.

What is this?

Are you doing, how did this get made right now with one of my movies?

You should do it with your own movie.

How dare you?

Has that ever happened before?

This is the first time hearing.

Was that movie bad?

I'm pretty sure.

You haven't left that.

95% on Rotten Tomatoes.

This whole month when you're out in the world.

Didn't it save the movies?

Didn't you do one of those Tom Cruise things before it?

Hey, welcome back to the movie.

It's me, the artisan.

Well, that's infinite too.

Yes, I'm Paramount Plus.

I'm Paramount Plus.

I'm sure you can.

Of course, I'm deep in making all of the sequels.

The sequels and spin-offs.

Yeah, I mean infinite too.

More infinite?

Oh, yes.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

Keep going infinite.

Hey, come on.

There's more to, I mean.

It's infinite too infinite.

Too infinity and beyond.

Were you in that buzz year?

What is it?

No, I was not in buzz year.

I wasn't in buzz year.

Buzz year.

Hey, buzz year.

I mean, it may as well be buzz year, right?

Yeah.

Stupid is what it actually is.

Sure.

Oh, yeah.

Absolutely.

You know, and I was to answer your question.

No, I was not in buzz year.

Hey, buzz year.

I'm going to get over your idiot.

Hey, idiot.

What's your name?

Buzz year?

Oh, look at who blew it.

Buzz year.

I don't even know what the plot is, but I'm going to assume that he's just an idiot.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah, for sure.

He's like, he's, I guess he's, he'd be buzz like years like idiot brother.

He buzzed you.

Buzz year.

Oh.

Well, Jason, it's good to see you.

I, of course, love having you here.

And it's always a pleasure to have you.

And I really want you more excited to spend the rest of the night.

Oh, we're.

Scott.

I'm sorry.

We're doing a show.

Oh, well, I need your help.

Sorry.

We're doing a show.

Whoever this is.

We know this person.

Whoever this is.

Yeah.

Who are you?

Sir, step out of the shadows.

Why are you?

Also, why are there so many shadow right now?

Why are the studios lit like a noir movie?

Yeah.

Why is happening right now?

Are you the fan of the opera sir?

I can only see half of your face.

The fan of the Scott.

It's me, Bob.

Bob who Bob.

Oh, Bob.

Bob Duke.

How dare you young man get over my knee right?

Oh, do it Scott.

All right.

Here we go.

Oh, yes.

Ow.

You nasty little boy.

You will have respect with me.

This is the, this is the maybe the only time I've seen Scott jump to yes and any initiation from anyone ever and do so with a degree of enthusiasm that was frankly terrifying.

I am having a horrible, horrible day.

I came in here for just a little bit of respite.

The last thing I expected was for my dear, dear, very close ex-step son to not recognize me.

I'm so sorry, Bob.

I just didn't expect to see you.

We're doing, we're in the middle of the show.

Do you know Jason and Zuka?

Yes, we've met before here in these studios actually.

Yeah.

And recall.

That's okay.

I love you who do not recall who Bob Dooka is.

You're a gentleman that was married to my mother for how long?

Nine months.

Six glorious months.

Six glorious months back in the, it doesn't matter.

It doesn't matter.

It's a little family for you.

It was a long time.

It was like yesterday to me.

What an interesting day for you.

You and I meet very, very close.

I mean, as all father son relationships are, are they difficult?

Are they not?

They're difficult.

They're tough.

Yes.

They're the shadow that you live under.

And you and I, as a step child, is always difficult to befriend and I will never stop trying.

That's my promise to you, though I am still angry that you didn't remember me.

Well, it's not that I didn't remember you because I didn't know you were coming.

I just, I could not see you.

And to be honest, I haven't.

Put those two together for me.

You don't remember me because you didn't know I was coming.

Well, you also, it's interesting.

You didn't seem, and I understand because yes, the doorway to the studio is shrouded in deep shadows.

I think they're saving on electricity or something.

Maybe.

I don't know what's going on in here.

I didn't know that you recorded an old timey vaudeville theater.

I tripped over so many sandbags.

There's so many dusty, velour curtains that I had to push through to get here.

But what's strange to me is you didn't seem to recognize his very iconic voice.

Well, yeah, that's what I, that's what I keep.

I was like, oh, I know this.

I have voice blindness.

I'm sorry.

Oh, yeah, I've never mentioned that.

All over sax ears.

I'm so very sorry.

I didn't really, I sorry.

Who are you again?

Jason Manzukas.

And I'm a friend of Scott's.

Have you seen Infinite?

Oh, yes.

Oh, you're the, I'm the artist.

Artisan.

Yes.

Oh, thank you, Bob.

You helped jog his memory.

Correct.

Oh, well, see Bob.

Love it.

Maybe you could help me.

Yeah.

I'm my cell phone charger.

Oh, oh, I don't, okay.

Neither do I think I could do that, but I don't actually think the artist in could do anything.

The artist in could do anything.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

Let me see if I can, let me see if the artist in here.

Bob, yes.

Where's your cell phone?

I don't know.

Your cell phone is not with you?

Not just the cell phone, but also the charger.

I didn't know where the charger was.

Not the cell phone.

Oh, where my cell phone.

Yes.

Where's your cell phone?

My cell phone's right.

Okay.

It's in your sock.

Yes.

Check your other sock.

I only have one.

Oh, damn it.

Okay.

Well, that's it.

The artist in could have it in.

Oh, no.

Oh, wow.

His whole movie is usually checking the other side.

I understand.

Check the other whatever it is.

That movie did so poorly.

What do you mean?

It didn't bad?

I got to look this up.

I'm a bit of a Paramount plus head.

Okay.

What are you watching on that?

A plus E?

Oh, that star Trek.

Star Trek lower desk.

Lower desk.

Tiny desk concert.

You watching Big Brother?

You watching the challenge?

I'm watching all of those things.

No, isn't there a Star Trek?

There's a new Star Trek.

Yeah, a new beginning.

A new Brave New World.

Yeah.

Yep.

Oh, I'm watching New World's rather.

You a Trekker?

Trek-y?

No, I'm trying to be though because it helps you connect with other people who don't have friends.

The old Trek connect.

Yeah.

That's an old Trek connect.

Yeah.

And find similarly lonely people.

Right.

Yeah, do you find the escape into a fantasy realm?

Yes, exactly.

Like those kind of fandoms are, you know, welcoming for people who are perhaps.

They have no choice.

Yeah.

They have no choice.

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's misfit toys.

Mm-hmm.

And, and, and, like, I, I, it's kind of like, you know, when, when a, a chauvinist goes to the Ren Fair and capitalizes on, on old timey beliefs and, and can be degrading to women because it sort of fits into the context.

Like get out of here, winch.

Yeah, exactly.

Exactly.

I do that with sci-fi communities and, and, and things like that.

Because of the whole paradigm that's a new art culture.

It's another.

And so they have no choice but to befriend me.

That's right.

It's welcoming of all races and all, uh, uh, nationalities and, uh, even, uh, people like you.

And even thank you for putting me on the bottom of that weird list.

Yes.

I'm at the, yeah.

Exactly right.

But Scott, I just need a few minutes to do that.

Just to, uh, collect myself and compose myself and receive some sucore after the difficult, very difficult day that I've had.

I, what, what happened?

Okay.

Fine.

I'll tell you.

As you may or may not know, I've been on a wedding rice diet for a few weeks.

What, what is a wedding?

I drink, I eat only, eat dry rice that I find outside of churches.

I have to bat away birds.

It's very well, well earned, cheap.

You get a lot of upper arm.

Do you only, I'm assuming you mostly can only eat on the weekends.

Right.

It's not a lot of weekday weddings.

I guess you could save up if, if they had a big rice budget for the wedding.

You can.

I have cargo pants with rice pockets.

Do you pick up each grain individually or do you have like a dust bust?

Do you have a scoop?

Yeah.

Oh, really?

I just get down there.

So you don't say, look how wide my tongue is.

Oh my gosh.

Christ.

It's like, it's like, um, if you know, like you've been next.

Exercising it clearly.

You know, yeah.

It's like that tongue emoji where it's like, yeah, my tongue looks like, like a, like, like a, like a display or first saltwater taffy machine, but it's not actually saltwater taffy.

Yeah, it's Jack.

Right.

Two.

It's like muscular.

Oh yeah.

Jack tongue.

Yeah.

How do you work that out?

I mean, obviously doing your church exercises, but did you, did you model for that emoji, by the way?

Cause that's almost identical.

Oh, I, I did.

I never got paid for that.

I don't know.

Do people model for those?

Oh, yes.

How many emojis have you modeled for seven, seven, which ones?

Well, I'll just have to show you the, well, the one with the, um, well, the thinking one.

Yeah.

Oh yeah.

We're the, we'll check this out.

Oh, wow.

Yeah.

What about that one with a monocle?

Mm hmm.

The one that's barfing.

You know what?

And that wasn't doing it right.

The guy poked me in the eye.

Oh gosh.

The bar of emoji, obviously.

The bar for emoji.

Yeah.

Uh, the skiing emoji.

Oh, oh, I love that one.

Yeah.

I use that one all the time.

So helpful.

They should, they should break emojis down into like, these are the ones that people use.

And these are the ones that are like, oh, yeah.

You're never going to use ever again unless you are actually talking about skiing.

I feel like a lot of weirdos would find each other that way.

If you could find which part of the country different people used emojis.

You should invent this app, Bob.

What's an app?

Oh, yeah.

Never mind.

Anyway, back to my bad day.

So I was on this dry rice diet.

Not thinking I accidentally drank a lot of water in my stomach almost exploded.

Oh gosh.

How the moisture went right to that dry, dry rice.

I got very, very ill and was homebound for several days.

And then I went to treat myself to a car wash chair and massage and got stuck.

So you in the chair?

In the chair.

Do you have a car or did you just walk into it?

Oh, no, no.

I'm just a fan of car wash chair massages.

I don't know if you're familiar.

Sure.

Yeah.

Of course.

Yeah.

Do you go to the same one?

Like once you find a good chair, you stick with it?

Until I'm no longer allowed.

And then I go, yeah.

But I enjoy it.

You know, I find the one, I find the car wash chair massages for just the right combination of spilled soda off brand chips and duct tape.

And that's what happened this one.

I got stuck on some duct tape and I couldn't leave.

They thought I was trying to like milk it.

So it's like it operated like some sort of like fly paper almost, but for Bob Dooka.

Could be.

Yes.

Yeah.

So they thought that you were trying to drive.

Yeah.

They thought you were strong.

Oh, duct tape?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, wow.

Double sided duct tape.

Is it that it's that strong or is it that you are weak?

Do they have duct tape for weak people?

I mean, listen, I, as you know, I love.

I just be masking tape.

Most of my income is as a test subject.

So if anybody's doing these studies, I'd love to find out.

Okay, great.

So everyone thought that you were trying to just hog the chair?

Right.

So they beat me with steering wheel covers.

Oh, no.

Yes.

You couldn't explain.

And then they made a game of it.

Oh, wow.

I was defending myself.

And then it became a ring toss.

So you stuck your hands out to defend yourself.

And then they started having fun.

I mean, it was, you know, when you're tickled too much and you want it to stop at your, your body's laughing.

So people think, how often does that happen to you as an adult?

Can we talk about something else?

I, I, do you want to do the original topic or something from like deep childhood?

Yeah.

Never mind.

Like, no offense, Bob, but you're an older man.

Is that are people tickling you to the point where you say this?

Let's just say this.

I very well known in the adult tickling community.

Not as a participant necessarily, but as a part of the participant anymore.

At first, it sounds like, sure, I'll make a couple extra bucks and some free food.

I like crudetay.

I want to go to Oman, just like anybody else.

But then it just keeps going and going and it doesn't stop.

So anyway, needless to say, I've had a very, very tough day and I just came here to relax.

Okay.

So I'm going to replace the car washes very nearby.

Oh, we did.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

I know there's one right across the street.

Yes.

That's the one.

That's the one with a giant hand holding the giant sponge that's connected to the giant car that's connected to a person waiting in the huge car wash building.

Yes.

And I found out that's not a real giant.

Oh, oh, okay.

They didn't cut off a giant's hand.

They did not.

Yeah.

I mean, I guess there goes that theory.

Bob, you do have a steering wheel protector on your neck.

Yeah, I know.

Oh, okay.

Yes.

All right.

Is that to protect your neck or is that?

Did you just place that?

So you can let people know that you are nothing to fuck with.

I feel like you guys are making a reference to something, but I don't know what it is.

Okay.

Yeah.

I understand that.

Look, Bob, it's a pleasure to have you, but can you stick around?

We need to, we need to take a break.

What?

Oh, we have, we talk about fine products that people can accumulate.

Like what?

You know, if you don't ever want to go to the post office ever again, you can.

Oh, God, I hate the post office.

Don't say anything bad about the post office.

Oh, oh, oh.

But just the experience of going there is what we could talk about.

Okay.

Because apparently I made too many jokes about the post office several years ago about how shitty it was.

Now, I'm not allowed to talk about how bad it is to these three.

Oh my God.

Is that real?

That's very funny.

But can you stick around?

We need to talk about some of these fine products.

Because the post office is great.

There are alternatives though.

Sure.

Of course.

Stick around.

Okay.

Because I'd love to talk to you on the other side of this break.

I'd love to hear more about this day.

Yeah.

Well, thank you.

But we're going to come back.

We'll have more from surprise guest Bob Dooka.

We'll have more from even more surprising guest Jason Manzukas in this video.

Yeah.

Incredible.

Plus we have someone else coming up that I don't know who it is.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back.

Jason Manzukas is here and very exciting to have him.

And how did this get made out there?

Like when's it come out Fridays?

Yes.

Fridays.

Sorry.

You have no idea.

I don't think it's always been Fridays.

But yes, it is Fridays.

That's right.

TGIF.

Oh yeah.

You should go to a TGIF now that you are in your post market.

That's how we should market the podcast.

We should tour TGIF.

You should.

Actually, this is a good idea.

It's a great idea.

This is another one of your...

This is...

We'll be bourbon wings.

Scott Archimans.

Great idea.

Isn't that one of your other podcasts?

It really, it should be.

Yeah.

This is going to slip down to number five.

We also have a speaking of slipping, a guy who's slipped many times in his life.

Oh yeah.

Bob Dooka is here.

My ex-stepfather is here.

That's right.

And you seem to be wearing a pair of data from Goonies' slick shoes.

Data from Goonies' slick shoes.

I'm trying to parse this.

Is there a character named Data in Goonies?

Isn't it?

Devan and Meran.

Because Data is from Star Trek, of course.

Oh, that's true too.

Am I right?

Devan's not...

Who's Data?

Is he the inventor kid in the Goonies?

Any invent slick shoes?

It doesn't matter.

Is he from the Indiana Jones guy who's from everything everywhere at once?

Or...

Oh, is that...

That might be right.

I don't know.

I don't know if that's the case.

Devan's struggling.

What are you talking about?

Sorry.

What are you talking about?

Yes, it is.

Devan's thumbs up.

He's...

His name is Data in Goonies.

I'm 99% sure.

Yes, there's a thumbs up from Devan.

Star Trek, you can't...

You can't name a character Data when there's an iconic character named Data in Goonies?

Yeah.

Or even thought about the commonality of those two...

The only two people ever named Data.

Also, here's the other thing.

But that would...

It doesn't matter.

If you were a sentient...

If you were a sentient robot, would you want to be called the thing that you process?

Data?

Yeah.

So it would be like you...

It's like being named Oxygen.

Or no.

Yeah.

I don't want to be called Oxygen.

Oxygen.

Or like shit.

Wait, you can soon shit.

Don't talk to me.

It's fine.

It's totally fine if you do.

I just got a link.

Scott is a copper file.

What is a copper file?

A copper file is somebody who likes do-do.

Okay.

Yeah.

I'm Bob.

What do you do...

You do...

One of your catchphrase that you rarely use is Scat Attack.

Scat Ocarman.

Scat.

Come on, guys.

That is better close.

I talked about Scat on a recent episode far too far.

Oh, really?

Well, it's not that kind of...

You shouldn't be ashamed of your pikodilos.

These got them and they actually...

They tell us quite a bit about each other.

Pikodilos.

What about you, though, Bob?

What has been going on with you?

Thank you for asking.

You're becoming a better stepson.

Well, to earn a few extra sheckles, I've been...

Got hired to create Buzzfeed headlines.

Oh.

And the way it works there is I just feed them...

Wait, Buzzier headlines?

Or...

How about you doing Buzzfeed headlines for about a year?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Oh, you're a beautiful young man.

Thank you.

Did your mother see anybody right now?

Oh, yes.

Yes, she is still happily married to my father.

How do you know?

Oh.

Have you checked today?

Yeah.

Oh, let me check.

Oh, yep.

How do you know they're happily married?

They seem to be going strong.

You don't think they're putting on a show for you?

I don't think so.

No.

Okay.

Oh, wait a minute, though.

That's really chilling to think about.

Anyway, I've been creating this...

You've been eating what?

Well, I've been eating my own hair because I have pikod.

Do you have a bezor in your stomach?

Oh, like these are?

Oh, yeah.

Like the equivalent of like an owl.

Yes.

You could go through it and see what I've been.

Sure.

All hair and undigested raisins and rice, rather, all the rest of whatever's in there.

Do you eat raisins?

I've never seen you eat a raisin.

Do you have an allergy?

I don't.

Who...

How many people have you seen eat raisins?

Every single person in my life, I try to watch them eating raisins at least once.

That's like a kink.

That's a kink that I don't understand.

Just to make sure...

Is the smacking, the dry smacking, then trying to remoisturize the grape?

Is that what you do with raisins?

Do you have journal?

I'm out to try to get them to a span.

And then I drink water and I mush them around so that I can try and turn it into a scratch.

This is from a garage journal.

Paul F got another raisin stuck on his back moment.

You'll never believe in a season.

Bob, how did you become my status?

You'll never believe it, diary.

I got Lauren and Paul to eat raisins on freedom.

You can't team up against me.

You're Bob Dooka.

I'm so sorry.

I'm Reba right.

I need to remember my station anyway.

If I may, I'd love to try out some of the...

My shriveled favorites found their way into Mike Hanford's mouth.

You won't believe it, diary.

Alright, you...

RIP.

RIP, the one with sunglasses.

RIP, the one with saxophone.

That might be the same one.

The California raisins.

California raisins.

Okay, let's...

Sunglasses, definitely.

Yes.

Saxophone, definitely.

Sure.

What are their other characteristics?

Gloves.

Yeah, they have gloves.

No.

I think they have gloves.

No gloves?

But do they all have sunglasses and do they all have a saxophone and gloves?

No, they don't all have saxophone.

Because I think they're the lead singer.

Right.

So one has a mic, probably.

Microphone?

Oh, I don't know.

Hmm.

Should we play it?

I don't think playing the song will help Marshall.

So we can watch it and comment on it.

Should we play the song and try to guess what they're holding?

I think a simple Google image search will take care of this.

Okay, I just think for the audience at home, they don't get to listen to us watch the commercials.

So it's not really satisfying as content, but you are phoning it in.

Howling for Nia.

I typed in a tough one.

Valed Jones.

Oh, it's over.

I'm the same.

I now can't.

There's a disconnect between the distance from my bad eyes to the thing.

And now it is every time I try and type words, it's gobbledygook.

Yeah.

Okay, here we go.

There's four of them.

You don't think you're just dumb?

Okay, so they all have sneakers.

They all seem to have converse low top sneakers.

They all have gloves.

Okay, but then here are the distinguishing characteristics.

Branded converse?

I mean, they look to be interesting to be like converse gets to have their sneakers in the California.

That was probably a pretty fun meeting, huh?

The raisin board.

The bombs on fire.

And the converse people.

The bomb is just.

Do he fits?

Are you working on an act?

I actually, well, Bob is so much easier to play with.

All right.

I did a lot of classes during the pandemic.

You did really?

Like what?

From where?

Improv of classes.

Oh, yeah.

Great.

Improvization.

So you would receive an initiation on a piece of paper.

And then how long would it take you to write back?

Each scene took six months.

It was long, but I learned a lot.

And is the edit you just stop hearing?

You stop hearing letters?

Yeah.

So after your first response, you did not hear back?

No, no.

After the first scene, I didn't hear back.

Oh, okay.

Then I move on to the next feature.

Oh, interesting.

Got it.

I just mail a stranger.

And they would open up a letter.

And it would say Margaret, we've been brother and sister our whole lives.

Where is my cell phone charger?

I actually think it would be a very funny thing if Bob Dooka just started cold sending letters to people just to see if he got any letters back.

Yeah, sort of like a ship in a bottle kind of thing, but via mail.

Yes.

No bottle, no ship.

That's right.

I mean, or a message.

A message in a bottle.

Maybe Bob could do maybe listeners would like Bob do get a right.

Someone they know a letter.

Oh, that's a good one.

It's a good one.

Have you ever become a human chip in the bottle?

It seems like something you would do.

I was kicked out of the bio dome.

You were.

Yes.

For what?

They tried to eat me.

What?

Why?

Apparently, well, you can.

Did they mistake you for their rice cooker?

I'll be.

I'll be honest.

I snuck in there.

Okay, it's just a rice cooker.

Okay.

Hey, it's full of rice.

How do we get it out?

Surprise.

I thought they would have to hang out with me.

All right.

Here are the distinguishing characteristics of the California raisins.

One has a flat top Mohawk and sunglasses.

To me, that's just gilding the living.

I agree.

Like the boss?

They look like that wooden football player.

Yeah.

How do you know the boss?

Yeah.

Big, big college sports fan.

The boss.

Yeah.

The boss has a much deeper base of knowledge than I know.

You know, this born epic has been good for you.

Before I became the physical and emotional wreck that I am, I was considered pretty stereotypically masculine man.

Really?

Yeah.

Was there a single thing that befell you an illness or an event?

Or was it a just never ending series of events and illnesses that knocked you into the, took you from the heights of masculinity to the man we see before us now?

It was, it was a woman told telling me that I was living a lie.

And then as she was saying that, I made eye contact with myself in a mirror and the whole facade came crumbling down.

Oh, no.

Yeah.

Wow.

The origin, the secret origin.

Wow.

And I said, but I'm wearing a Harley Davidson shirt.

She said, you're overcompensating.

Have you ever been on a motor's?

I can't get that point.

No.

Yeah.

No, but I collected the shirts.

You collected them.

Harley, David, I've, I've, I've, I've poured to a third different, each different city I'd go into.

Harley, David's daughter.

Harley, David's uncle.

Um, okay.

Here are the other characteristics.

One has, I can only assume to be like a 50s kind of curly, uh, flat top and then horribly distended protruding cheeks.

And then one has like what appears to be almost an Afro flat top, uh, and is a little more heavy set and then one, another one has like a pretty, pretty high, high, like, uh, almost hairsprayed hair, but that's it.

You had no saxophone.

Just one has sunglasses.

When are they going to make the California raisin biopic?

I know.

Wow.

I mean, they've certainly enough other nonsense has gotten that treatment.

You know what I mean?

I wonder is it, is it, is it IP that's owned by the raisin board?

And that's why big raisin?

Big raisin can't be exploited.

You think big raisin isn't on this?

I mean, that's an ad for a specific company.

Who's big raisin?

Yeah.

I heard they got bought by sour grapes.

Oh, the movie, the Larry David movie.

Okay, Bob, what do we tell us about your thing?

I bought you around.

What about the raisin?

Yeah, big, god damn it.

Now the spot Scott.

I love Scott that we moved fully off of the California raisins for so long and got into other stuff.

And then you brought it back.

And then when you were done talking about it, you were like, I'm done.

I'm mentally over this, Bob.

Come on.

Talk about your goddamn thing.

What do you got here?

Why does your paper say not funny on the book?

It's true.

A little notes to yourself.

No.

Or is it funny because you when you hold up the paper only we can see that it says not funny to us.

This is like, I just like you just gave us the finger.

You push, just push your glasses up with the middle finger.

But this is like, Bob is only mechanistic here.

Bob took us become a troll.

Married.

Yes.

The following are BuzzFeed headlines that I've submitted to Jonah Paredy.

Yeah, I believe he's still there.

I'll be honest, some of these I stole and I'm just going to resubmit their actual.

You stole them from BuzzFeed itself?

Okay.

That's a list.

That's a headline.

Okay.

To headline.

Then they have to, then they have to write the art.

You're not paid.

Yeah, you haven't written.

They're going to kind of sell out.

I'm not a journalist.

I just submit the headlines.

If they buy a headline, they are then forced to write the article.

Yes.

Okay.

Interesting process.

And do you get paid per word or per headline?

Per headline.

Okay.

So if they buy this Maud Appetale one, they're locked in.

Do they have to contact her?

They're locked in.

Then they have to get a quote from her mom.

See, now that article, it seems like it's hard to write because that's just like I demand to know.

But how is it?

Do you have one article?

That's the first letter that I write.

I was going to say is there.

And I'll put it in ransom font.

Is there a font?

Man, you're typing has come so far.

You have to ransom font is you cut a bunch of different letters from newspapers and you put it on your typewriter keys.

Oh, okay.

I see.

Got it.

Out of curiosity, do you have a headline that establishes what you want?

You are?

Huh?

What was the one you just read?

I want to know which lunchable you are.

Yeah.

Do you have a headline that tells you which lunchable you are?

The opposite way is the way to write the article.

No, this is a quiz.

This is a quiz.

Is you just want to know which lunchable you are?

No, is that that article?

I'm not saying that this was directly taken from BuzzFeed, but I'm also not saying that it's not not.

Okay.

And is that for you, you, Bob Dooka, or that's just again for us to entertain?

Huh?

Okay.

Bob does it better.

Just continue.

We need a Bob Dooka sound board that just goes, huh?

I'm pointing right at you.

Go.

Okay.

Hey, watch out.

That thing's got a nail in it.

Okay.

17 times movies.

He didn't count it down.

Three, two.

17 times movies.

17 times movies.

Okay.

Three, two.

It's not feedback necessarily as it's just like, oh, but it's so glad you should have been doing it.

People and see how you react.

Right.

Yeah.

So you have not submitted these yet?

Not yet.

And is this primarily lately how you've been making a living?

Is submitting headlines to BuzzFeed or do you submit headlines elsewhere as well?

Just just a BuzzFeed right now.

Do you submit any to the New York Times or the New Yorker?

What are those?

Oh, interesting.

Any other news sources?

No, but I don't...

Right.

But I don't have to if I just get the headline version.

The headline version.

It's like instead of going to movies you just read recaps of them.

No activity.

A show that I'm on on Paramount Plus.

Oh.

Is it just plugs yet?

You're just plugging horrible things.

I just remembered.

Yeah.

Well Bob.

Why do you say horrible things?

Oh, I'm sure it's good.

How dare you.

Bob, it's so great to have you back.

You should spank him.

Okay.

Wait.

No.

Here we go.

Oh God.

I don't know.

I don't want this.

This is not what I wanted.

You're doing this to yourself.

I'm a gamer out there.

Bob, wait.

What a nasty.

Look at all those raisins that fell out of his pocket.

Those are raisins.

The floor is.

Oh God.

What?

That's not my pocket.

What is wrong with you?

All right.

Look, we have to take a break.

We got so excited he raisined all over the floor.

We have to take a break.

When we come back, we have a guest that I don't know who they are.

This is exciting, right?

Come on guys.

Back me up here.

Don't immediately go to your phone.

Just because I say we have to take a break.

All right.

We're going to come right back.

We'll be right back with more Bob Dooka, more Jason Mansukas.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

We're back.

Jason Mansukas.

You're just making fun of my kids now.

I'm so sorry.

We had you back.

We also have Bob Dookas here.

You're going to make fun of me at all Bob.

Suddenly you're a high status character.

Don't know how it happened.

Hey, bro.

If the shoe fits.

All right.

Let's get to our next guest.

I have no idea who they are or what they're doing here.

I just got an email saying that they're booked on the show.

But please welcome Stacey Bizaba.

Oh my God.

I can't believe this works.

Scott, I've been attempting to email you for years.

Stop out of the shadows.

I can't quite.

I'm sitting on the mic.

Oh, wait.

You might recognize me.

I'm not fly.

You keep trying to swat away.

Oh.

And I've been using your keyboard, but I have to use my whole body weight to jump on every letter.

The emails don't always come out the way I want, but I did it.

You did it.

You're on my mic right now.

You're right next to my list.

Yeah.

Hi.

Don't worry.

You should be used.

Don't I sleep on your eyelid like a lot of nights.

Oh, my God.

Sometimes I sleep in the little cupids, cupids bow above your lip.

But sometimes it's funny.

Oh, you've noticed that.

And then I slip off.

Hey, it's so good to, I guess, meet you in person.

Nice to meet you.

I mean, I've, I've, I've, you know, waved my hand at you several times recently.

I know you have.

That's you.

Yeah.

And forgiven because I realize you can't hear me unless I'm in a mic.

I mean, it's hard.

Otherwise here, I'm going to back away.

So you now you'll know who I am.

Okay.

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Oh, wow.

Oh, okay.

So you just need to be amplified.

I've been talking to you this whole time.

Is that how we sound to God?

Just.

Wow.

Jason, you're so slow.

You're so slow.

So think about the fact that this person has been trying to, or not this person.

I mean, I apologize.

Yeah.

What is called?

This one has been trying to talk to you for so long.

Yeah.

For so long.

And only, this is, I almost feel like this is like a very private moment for both of you.

Well, I also wonder who else in your life has been trying to talk to you for so, so long.

I'm sorry.

I've been busy right now.

We're not talking.

There's no other people here.

Oh boy.

I've been emailing for years once I talk about our thoughts.

What is the lifespan of a flight?

I thought flies only live to be 24 hours.

Fowlacy, that's a fruit fly.

Oh, fallacy, that's a fruit fly.

We, I know a lot of fruit flies, a lot of named fallacy.

It's an array.

You know, they love irony, those fruit flies, which is ironic.

What type of fly are you?

You're not a fruit fly.

So you don't like raisins.

So I'm not going to see you eat raisins.

I find raisins difficult.

I'm knee deep in the grooves.

It's hard to eat when you're knee deep in what you're eating.

Yeah.

So to speak.

Do you barf on your food?

Like he posts for the barf emoji.

I've been barfing on your wedding rice.

I couldn't believe it.

I was like, oh my god, we're doing the same thing.

So you get around.

Oh, I mean, I sleep at your house mostly, because I do like the air conditioning and I like the cable and I do like your laptop because you have very light keys.

I do have basic cable.

Yeah.

It's those bony little bird fingers that you have.

There's like bird bone fingers that you have.

Why are you coming down on me this time?

I'm just noticing things.

But yeah, you have to laugh.

Bob's looking at life through a whole new lens and is thriving.

Yeah, what gave you this?

I'll be honest.

There's a blues riff playing in my head and I feel pretty.

Yeah.

I feel pretty.

Wait, Bob, I feel like did you say someplace that you've been listening to a lot of the Joe Rogan podcast?

Oh, OK.

Do you guys know about him?

Yeah.

I think he might be a scientist.

Well, that's why I stop going to Bob's house.

Oh, is that so do you make your way around to different comedy bang bang related people or is OK?

Only comedy bang bang related people.

So Randy Snott's Randy Snott's and all the other ones.

So deep break the whisper.

Yeah, brave the whisper brave the barber.

Can I ask are you are you were you born a fly or did you start out as a scientist?

What the fuck is wrong with you?

That's a really rude question.

I start out as a scientist.

He's talking about like a wonderful flight.

I don't know if you were like a fictional movie, which by the way, how do you know?

I have a pitch for.

Oh, OK.

So you're offended.

Oh, suddenly you're a Hollywood.

You're offended until it's a segue.

I like a dovetail.

I like a dovetail and I like to segue.

If I could ride a real segue, that would be my dream.

Oh, man.

Those are going to change cities forever.

Yeah, it's going to revolutionize how people commute.

Well, not for me.

So here's my pitch.

Don't you fly?

Why do you want to be on a segue?

I mean, you can walk.

Why do you want to be on one?

By the way, snap.

Oh, yes, Scott.

Nobody's scared of you today.

Kind of why she's attracted you because you're such a big piece of shit.

They know when that attracted real roommates.

We're just roommates.

By the way, calling you a fly is like calling me a walk.

You know, it's like, why are you the verb that the thing that you do?

Well, you know, you guys named me.

I want to say that.

Flies don't call each other flies.

I've gotten used to introducing myself that way.

Your name, though, is Stacy Bizaba.

Stacy Bizaba.

That's my name.

Yeah.

What's in fly is Stacy Bizaba.

Oh, OK.

Sorry.

Oh, OK.

You got to really hit that up.

Yeah.

I'm curious, Stacy.

Did you start kind of sleeping at Scott's and spending a lot of time at Scott's because you were a fan of the podcast?

Or were you there and discovered the podcast as a result?

I was actually hatched as a little egg in your beard.

What?

That makes sense now.

Wow.

Oh, my God.

I just thought that you had a really cozy kind of safe vibe.

Really?

Like a warm blanket.

That's really sweet.

I love that somebody saw my beard and thought of it as like a place to raise a family.

Well, then you then did rake your fingers through your beard and I was the only egg to survive.

I am so sorry for your loss.

Not for me, though.

You're thriving.

You're an only child.

You're a child.

Yes.

Let's hear this pitch.

OK.

Listen, it's a big, here's a small pitch and it's the fly within a big pitch, which is, I don't think there's enough movies made where the fly is the star.

The protagonist.

I've been background in many movies and I want to tell you what, you'll never have to feed me craft service.

I get on it.

I eat what I want.

I throw up.

Nobody ever knows.

What movies have you been in as background?

I'm trying to think of any movie.

You've got to be a Mr. Bean movie or two that you've been in.

Yeah.

Have you seen any of the Mr. Bean movies?

I'm always circling his head.

I saw a money ball.

Is that what you're talking about?

I'm in money ball to you.

And money ball.

You're in that scene where you land on you can fly around Brad Pitta and then he goes I want to just explain it so people don't.

No, no insane.

His name's Billy Bean in money ball.

You just explained it a second time.

Well, because nobody heard that.

Bob was talking.

Have you guys seen that show Sex and the City?

Sex and the City?

Sex in the City?

I'm not sure honestly.

I think it's Sex and the City.

I think it's hand.

Is it hand really?

I believe it is.

I mean, they are having sex in the City.

Do they go outside the City limits?

They just have sex.

Okay, let's take this to Brooklyn.

Yes.

They do have sex in the City.

That was the cab Ray laws.

You can know dancing in bars and sex only in Jersey.

Only in Jersey.

Yeah.

But the Cavs won't go there.

Right.

Yeah.

Some of the best.

You know a lot about New York.

You don't know.

I was background on Sex and the City.

Really?

Every sidewalk cafe scene I'm in.

Wow.

Incredible.

I wasn't under contract.

I was volunteering my background work at that time.

To get a foot in the industry.

Yeah.

That's how you have to get a foot in the industry.

Oh, I have a question.

I have a question.

It's hot guys about Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Kautrell.

Well, SJP.

Do you know who those two people are?

No, but I want to feel included.

Did they?

What happened?

Well, oh, you mean between the two of them?

Yeah.

Did you notice?

There are notorious drama on set.

I'm a fly on the wall.

Whoa.

Do you want to know what really happened?

Yeah.

Tell us.

I had nothing to do with the, you know, the calling about the grief, what, you know, the whole thing that was on in the tabloids.

You know, you know how the tabloids said somebody called somebody about a grief.

A grief?

A.

Charlie Brown.

Somebody.

Somebody died in one of their families.

Oh, oh, I see.

Yes.

I think, yeah.

Someone called and said, I'm so sorry.

Okay.

That's what the tabloids said.

Look, it's hard for me to read because I'm so close that I get one.

Yeah, you might be getting some of these.

I take you hours to read one article.

Hours.

And then by the time I get to the end, I do sort of forget how it starts.

Oh, yeah.

You have the brain of a fly.

Listen, listen, I have 1000 eyeballs.

So shut the fuck up.

Yeah.

I mean, for all you know, Stacy Bizaba is a Bizaba, correct?

Yes.

Is a, is a PhD, you know, who knows?

I could be, I could be a PhD.

What's a PhD?

Go ahead and say it.

Oh, I don't know.

Okay.

By the way, how many of your eyes are seeing this right now?

Whoa, double finger.

More like a thousand.

Scott's been clearly feeling ganggified because he's resorting to just to like, true.

Flipping off the guests and being a real jerk.

But look, back to the fly.

Yeah.

What's your pitch?

It's already called the fly.

Back to the California reasons.

Do the California reasons meet the fly?

I'm open to pitches.

Okay.

This is what I want to get with you guys because you guys are funny.

You're open-minded.

You're going to, you're going to see where I'm coming from.

Okay.

What do you got?

We do a remake of the fly.

We don't have to change the title because it's so obvious.

Yeah.

It's iconic.

It's a fly who's experimenting in their little tiny laboratory and they accidentally turn into Jeff Goldblum.

Whoa.

It's a reverse fly.

I can guarantee you'll do it.

It's a reverse remake fly POV.

A reverse me.

And Jeff Goldblum is just, what does he do?

He doesn't know what to do.

Suddenly, he sits down at the piano and just- Now I'm thinking about it.

Is it the same movie?

Well, no, but he has kind of a fun, freaky Friday element where the person as a fly has to, let's say he's got a big board meeting or something and everybody's like, why are you eating that rotten fruit?

Why are you eating that poop?

And he's like, oh, so he has to cover for himself.

See, this is why I wanted to come on this show.

There we go.

Here's how it's different.

Okay, so you're saying the fly is performing an experiment and has a similar machine.

And this time, Jeff Goldblum just wanders into the machine.

Yeah, but that would be hard because the tiny machine would be so tiny.

Yeah, that would be a little difficult to do.

Yeah.

So the setup would have to be slightly different in that the fly is experimenting with human DNA or something like that.

And invariably the experiment goes wrong, thus turning the fly progressively into a human, not me.

Do you want to write this?

Do you want to write the first 20 pages, then abandon it?

I don't abandon it.

Like your other scripts.

You're on to something because here's what happened.

The fly lands on Jeff Goldblum's taint and it gets a little FICO matter.

Oh, I like this.

And then it flies home to its laboratory.

Right.

And it's doing an experiment and then gets into the machine and suddenly it becomes...

And it definitely throws up the FICO matter and Jeff Goldblum's DNA.

Wow.

And suddenly he grows... is he a tiny Jeff Goldblum the size of a fly?

Does he play piano ever too?

Well, we have to get the piano in there.

We have to get to it.

He loves it.

It's honestly when I think about this movie, the jazz is the background to the whole movie.

It's the way to get Jeff Goldblum in your thing is to have his character playing jazz piano in it.

He'll just agree to it.

And he's tiny because we've never seen a movie about a teeny, tiny jazz play.

As far as I know, we've only seen Jeff Goldblum, Jeff Goldblum sized in any movie.

We haven't seen him giant.

We haven't seen him like in a honey eye shrunk the kids scenario.

What was going on here?

I mean, he seemed small next to the dinosaurs, but that wasn't real.

Yeah, it's a forced perspective.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Would you rather see a movie in which Jeff Goldblum...

Oh, is this what you rather?

Oh, I love what you rather.

Do we have the theme, Devin?

Devin, can we do it?

Would you rather please?

Yeah, let's get the theme going.

I always wanted to play with you.

I remember it.

I was pretty close.

Yeah, you were.

I remember it a lot of it.

Don't talk to your entire scene.

I know.

Why are you doing this again?

Okay, Jason, what is your other scenario?

Would you rather a movie...

I felt like a Paul Thomas Anderson sound.

Do you know who that is?

Huh?

He does the one you do.

Three of them with me.

Tris is nice.

Paul Thomas Anderson.

Yes.

Would you rather watch a movie or be inside of a fictitious world in which Jeff Goldblum is tiny, i.e.

Honey, I shrunk the kids, etc., got an inner space, or he is giant?

I'll...

Jack and the Jack and the winner.

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Yeah, Gulliver's travels.

Perfect example.

Yeah.

Are you opening the floor for questions?

I am now opening the floor for questions.

Okay, who directed the movie?

Such a good question.

Because a lot of times I'll only go see a movie based on the writer or the director or the star or the script or how it's made or the trailer.

Okay.

Or word of mouth.

Or reviews.

Boy, you are a stickler.

This is...

Why?

This is whether or not there's air conditioning.

Sure.

How much it costs if it's a free screening?

Anything else?

No, those are pretty much the parameters.

Okay.

Michael Bay.

Oh, Michael Bay.

Can I answer?

What Bay is he named after?

Pigs.

Great.

You know, Michael Bay learned his camera moves from me.

Oh, the swooping zooming.

Yeah.

He learned that by watching.

Those kinetic flying...

Yeah.

Yeah, fly like the camera moves.

That was all me.

Before I did background on one of his other movies.

True.

The Rock.

On the rock.

Sure.

I inspired the Armageddon swoops around Liv when she's crying.

Oh, oh.

Swoops around.

Bruce.

There also when Aerosmith recorded all the music for it.

I was there for all of them.

In the room.

Wow.

I was there and he looked at a bunch of sexy videos of his daughter for the inspiration.

So hot.

For the song.

So hot.

Are you upset that drones are a thing now?

I mean, it seems like they're taking up your airspace.

I mean, well, I don't even mind the airspace.

I just think give credit.

Yeah.

Because we based them on what you...

That's what I do.

Well, and you're also taking potentially cameras.

I am certain somebody in your position.

Cameras were trending towards getting smaller and smaller and smaller.

So pretty soon you could have been a camera operator, a cinematographer, you know, a director of photography.

You could have had a whole new career open up.

But now, you know, drones are taking up all those jobs.

I could still do it.

You guys could get me in.

I mean, that's again.

That's why I am here.

I could direct the Jeff Goldbloom.

Your Jeff Goldbloom reverse fly movie.

It's tiny.

I think it's going to be hard if he's bigger.

Make it a tiny movie.

Would you rather...

We're in this...

Oh, you have another one?

All right.

Let's do...

Okay.

Let's play the theme again.

Does it get shorter each time?

Shh.

I'm going to swat you.

Oh, what?

Why would it get shorter each time?

Shh.

I made the theme.

It's a catchy picture of Daniel Day Lewis digging a oil well right now.

I'm an oil man.

It's a song.

Songs don't, like, indeterminately get shorter or longer each time you play.

You've made them multiple times.

It's like a countdown, you know.

Some songs should get shorter the more times you play them.

You know, it's like you've heard them already.

You don't need to get the whole thing in more.

Yeah.

Fun fact that...

Shh.

Okay.

What's this?

Shh.

Would you rather inside of the would you rather is...

Okay.

And this is specifically for you Stacey.

Do you...

We don't get to ask questions on this?

Oh, I guess you could all ask questions.

Okay.

But would you rather make this adaptation of the fly?

What's Mark Wahlberg like?

Oh boy.

I would love to talk to you about that.

I would just work it as questions.

I'd just tell you, I'd tell you about that.

Absolutely, we can talk about that.

Would you rather make this fly adaptation reverse fly or just because it seems like you're such a fan, be a part of the comedy bang bang kind of podcast world.

Maybe have your own podcast on CBB World.

Oh my God.

I have to choose.

Yeah.

I mean, are you opening the floor for questions?

I'm opening the floor for questions.

Okay.

And the floor remains open for the previous...

For the previous one, yeah.

Would you rather a tiny...

Do I have to go through my giant fix?

Do I have to pay her in money or in like rotten food?

I mean, do I get to answer this question?

Yeah, I guess you could.

What would you prefer?

Just rotten food.

Really?

I mean, you don't even have to do anything.

I already eat at your house.

Listen, that's my way.

Then I can get money.

I want to get paid in rotten food.

What would I do with money?

It's a good point.

I mean, I land on money sometimes because it's like a lot of fecal powder.

No dirty.

You are so dirty.

Oh, it's my favorite.

Yeah.

It's weird that we even still use it.

It's disgusting.

It's a rare find now.

Yeah.

Your wallet doesn't have any.

Yeah, I know.

It just has a bunch of moths.

Sorry if you have to battle them.

Yeah, I'm not a fan of the moths in your wallet.

I'll be honest.

I stay away from that wallet.

Yeah, they're there just to signify how empty my wallet is.

I'm sorry.

Well, it's a funny bit the first time.

I know.

You want them to get shorter and shorter.

Yeah.

It's sad now because a lot of times you performatively open your wallet, hoping the moths will fly out and insinuate there's nothing in there, but they're just dead.

Yeah, they're dead.

They just shake them out onto the floor.

What was the first one?

How tight is it?

How big does he get?

Are we able to see him entirely?

He can be like Kaiju size or do we only see his feet the entire movie?

No, you'll see his whole body, but you know, he can grow.

I mean, let's say he in the giant version, he can be anywhere from like frosted giant size, you know, to like the new Lord of the Rings, rings of power series.

I was going to say or from the Thor movies or whatever, but any kind of and then but he could also be as big as like a Pacific Rim Kaiju.

Oh, here's my concern.

Oh, can we offer concerns and not just questions?

Well, we are now entering concern corner.

I can't.

Can we hear that thing?

Can we hear the concern corner thing?

Definitely.

We have a theme for that.

Shaking is that no.

Okay.

I mean, I sing too.

If you want me to do a new theme.

Oh, yeah, please.

Okay.

I'm concerned.

I've got a concern for you.

Got a concern for you.

We've all got concerns to share.

Is it still going?

All got concerns to share.

Sometimes a concern comes up and you've got to share it.

We've all got concerns in our heart.

I'll go as long as the other one.

Sometimes concerns can be concerning, but don't you worry.

Just be discerning when you're trying to figure out your concerns.

No need.

No idea.

No talking during the theme.

And then it would be something like that.

Okay.

I love it.

And it could be something that like if you don't mind and you know, to protect your IP, if you would like.

But our listeners could take that, put music under it, elongate it, remix it.

Yeah.

Are you cool with that?

Yeah.

I would love that.

You guys, I mean, I know you can't really see my up close Facebook.

Could we get a poster so people know if you get a magnifying glass?

You guys will see.

I have so many.

Where do you get magnifying?

Are there like what we should cosplay?

What we should get is what they're phone giant.

We should get giant.

We should get giant magnifying glass and put it on the arm, the mic arm so that you can be looking so at the, at Stacy on the mic.

I would love that.

All right.

Let me get my magnifying glass app here and let's see how.

Ooh.

What was that?

Ooh, it sounded like a horny.

Yeah.

Kind of a butterfly.

Hey, what?

Look, a couple of my eyes might be a little milky, but I've been in the, you know, like for a long time.

Not the most symmetrical fly face I've ever seen.

Wow.

This is someone who's come on and just contributed like a new song to your podcast.

Yeah.

A new point of view that we've never heard from before.

Sorry.

It's like a, you are Stacy.

You were a fascinating guest and I apologize for scuts.

Just, just, scuts just but hurt because everybody's being mean to me, including Bob Dooka.

I'm sorry.

I called you a butterfly.

It's fine.

Don't accept the apology.

You know, butterflies, that's a completely different, you know, they're, they're not kind.

They're not a kind species.

And I don't.

When I said butterfly, I meant like a butter face for a fly.

Oh my God.

Well, I thought you were just calling me a big insect.

No, sorry.

Hey, look, here's my.

Can you use butter face in a sentence?

So it's more of a butterfly.

I think this is a good time.

Yeah.

Can I use a butter face in a sentence?

She's a real butter face.

Okay.

Wow.

You've just become so cruel.

You'd like Joe Rogan.

You should.

I think he's trying to swap me with words since he can't swap me with his hands right now.

It's why you.

Okay, come back.

Okay.

All right.

Are we still in the middle?

Would you rather in two?

I have.

I want to.

Wait.

Yes.

Bob, I just want, I want a tiny Jeff Goldblum who has to jump on the piano keys.

Great.

I love that jazz out.

So smart.

Yeah.

And actually, I mean, you guys are comedians, but I feel like you know science too.

It's been a long time.

Yeah, of course we do.

I did some reading.

Yeah.

Do you think we could shrink Jeff Goldblum for real?

To do the movie.

And then just to be my friend.

Oh, I think so.

We'd have to lure him here.

We all we would need is, I mean, almost everything.

We have almost everything we need.

We're near Jeff Goldblum and we get our hands on a piano.

We get a piano and a guitar.

The only thing we need is the, is I guess the technology required to shrink a living human being successful.

That's easy.

We can figure that out.

That feels like a pain.

But you just get, you just get a trail of aero on gift cards.

Serious question.

In the movie big.

Yeah.

Did they shrink Tom Hanks and Robert Loja for them to be on that piano?

That must have been how they did that, right?

It must have been how they did that.

Maybe, in other words, you have to build a giant piano.

That would be insane.

I think they did that.

I think it was a giant piano that they built.

That's insane.

I should have been in that.

What about that?

That's a building in New York City.

The entirety of the building is a piano.

Really?

And it's just that floor has the keyboard.

Oh my God.

So the rest is like the little hammers.

And yes, the strings, the hammers, the resonant chamber, all the, you know.

That would be a terrifying building for me to fly through.

I'd be killed immediately.

Oh, this sound would be.

Please hammer, don't hurt him.

Or don't hurt her.

Don't hurt her.

You know, you have to, you have to shut down the questions at a certain point.

I do.

I'm going to keep my, don't worry.

I'll do it.

Bob, any other questions?

So Mark Wahlberg, is it a crazy diet?

Is it just like all, what is it all chicken breast?

You got to watch his reality show.

You'll see.

He has to sell it in there.

He'll get it and his workouts, the whole thing.

Well, but here's the big question.

Yeah.

What happened to his clothes line?

I know he was trying to get that apparel.

That's sort of terrible thing.

I don't know.

That's a good question.

And then the pandemic really just really put a kind of.

Pandemic really.

I have a question.

Did you ever take that TV out of the break room at Wahlbergers that you were so upset about?

I don't know.

You watch Wahlbergers.

I do not.

It wasn't Wahlbergers.

It was his other Paramount Plus reality show that took place in the making of your movie where basically it's mid pandemic.

He says Wahlbergers is losing money.

He walks into Wahlbergers.

He's a TV in the break room and is like, what are they doing?

They're allowed to watch TV.

And he attributes the failure of Wahlbergers too.

People watching TV during the break.

Is Wahlbergers a burger chain owned by Mark Wahlbergers?

By the Wahlberg family.

Yes.

The brothers.

I got to go.

You got to go.

They have rotten food.

Oh, I'm sure there's a dumpster behind a Wahlbergers that you're going to just love.

Hey, hey, hey.

I like it fresh.

When people lift up their little bun to put on their condiment, I dip in.

Oh, that's true.

You might like Wahlbergers.

That's probably the only food that a fly would actually like before it turns rotten.

Wow.

Sounds like a review to me.

Savage takes from Scott Ocarman today.

Sorry.

I know he's your co-star.

The fans of Scott Ocarman are his and his alone.

They do not reflect the opinions of anybody else on this panel, including me, Jason Manzukas.

The artisan.

The AKA the artisan.

When are you shutting down the questions?

And I am now closing the floor for questions.

For the.

On the first one.

Okay.

So we can still ask the questions about that.

We can still ask you questions about would you rather make the movie with Jeff Goldblum or be a part of this?

This is just for Stacy.

Or be a part of the CBB World universe.

Yeah.

Do you want?

I want the one where I think of my own career.

Yes.

I mean, I want it.

But you felt first.

Yeah.

I want to say yes because I want to go.

I want to work with Jeff Goldblum.

I don't know.

I want to create my own brand.

Exactly.

You can work with whoever you want there.

Other flies.

Dude, like other flies or really?

Really?

I don't really like them.

I mean, that's that's why I've been bugging you for so long.

Bugging.

That's another thing.

You know, like we call the verb of like bothering.

We call it.

We name it after you, you know?

That's what I'm saying.

I mean, you guys, you know, I don't hold it against you though because I love what you do.

I love what you do.

You must be so hard because it seems like you don't get along with or don't necessarily have strong relationships with other flies or other insects perhaps.

But you're so solicitous of relationship with people who until just today could not hear you.

And we're trying to kill me.

And we're actively trying to kill you.

And who might try to kill you very soon?

You know, that's a lonely life.

I feel like I keep feeling like we get somewhere.

I know, but I mean, there's a real fucking energy between you two.

I have to be honest.

Oh, what energy?

Well, I don't know how else to say it.

Like a will they won't.

They're a section.

It's real.

I'm not going to have salmon with this.

Why?

It's real salmon, Diane, and cheers.

It's more like will he kill this fire?

Will I not kill this salmon swimming upstream?

I landed on every part of your body.

We're in a relationship whether you like it or not.

And I don't mean to be weird.

Consencially, it's just what I do.

That's just like how I am.

This is interesting too because I guess in a lot of ways because you sleep with Scott.

Yeah.

You are part of his marriage.

Yeah, you're in a trouble sort of with the cool happener.

You're in a three-way relationship.

You're in a three-way relationship too?

Well, occasionally, but you know, you're my real roommate.

Get your paws off my wife.

Hey, hey, hey, I have a little feet.

Okay, I have a little feet.

Do you have a little feet?

Two.

A little feet, little fingers.

Where do you backloaves?

From the same place of California, raised in the side that they have different sizes.

Oh, got it.

Are you shutting down the question?

I am now shutting down the floor for questions.

Okay, do we have to vote?

Oh, yes, we have to vote.

Go ahead.

Okay, so I vote for...

God, this is a tough...

Because I need content for a CBB present.

Great, great.

But I do want to see you do that fly movie.

Oh, boy.

Because I love Jeff Goldblum.

Oh, boy, it is tough.

It's tough.

I'm going to go with a Jeff Goldblum.

Oh, wow.

Interesting.

But you don't have the power to make that.

I'm so sorry, Scott.

That is incorrect.

Oh, shit.

All right, Bob, how do you vote?

I'm not...

I don't know if I'm registered to vote here.

Oh, okay.

Are you a felon too?

Is this voter fraud?

I'll be honest.

Yeah, I did vote earlier.

Okay.

Earlier today?

Yeah.

There's not an election going on today.

I know, but I...

Are you sure?

It's California.

There's an election every two times.

No, I vote for...

I want to see a teeny tiny Jeff Goldblum.

Yeah.

God damn it.

Sorry, but it's incorrect.

Nobody's voting for my career.

That is incorrect, Bob.

I'm so sorry.

How are you going to vote?

Stacey.

I am voting for my career.

I'm voting for...

Tell us what you think.

Who are you voting for?

For my...

But who are you...

Yeah, just voting for?

Bob, for me.

For...

But who are you voting for?

You need...

You've been waiting all this time to be listened to.

Tell us.

Are you guys...

You're at...

You're treating me like I'm just buzzing right now.

Can you not hear me?

I think stop working.

Stacey, I can hear you.

I can hear you.

Okay, there's nothing with you.

So you want your own show...

I want my own show.

Because I can have Jeff Goldblum on it.

That is not only is that the right answer, but you get that wish.

You get to have your own CBB world pilot.

As we all know, Jason is the person who...

I'm the creative director behind CBB World.

I've been operating in the shadows until now.

So you've got your own show.

It's a pilot.

You can do whatever you want from the...

It's a flies...

It's a fly...

It's a flies eyes.

Does she have to wear a little converse?

A few flies eyes.

Two flies eyes.

One thousand episodes.

That's the same thing, Bill.

One thousand episodes for all the things you've seen.

I'm going to go back to something.

Got through a flies eye.

Oh my god.

This is the best day of my life.

Do you know who that is?

No.

But you know about Mr. D.

Richard's brother.

Oh boy.

Do we vote on the other one now?

Oh, I don't think so.

So we're just not going to vote.

That one just went away.

That's died on the vine.

Okay.

Alright, well I guess that's how you play, would you rather?

This is from Star Wars.

Shut the...

Ow!

Oh!

See?

He's got a little chubby.

You shut up.

You dirty boy.

So much spanking and slapping for you today.

Real horn dog.

Should there be a restaurant chain called Horn Dogs?

There should be.

Yes.

They serve hot dogs with naked wind.

I'm trying to fuck you.

Like it should be like a hooters.

Yeah, hooters but hot dogs.

There are twin peeks or one of those.

There's no sexy male waiter restaurant.

Oh, it should be that.

Yeah, for women to come to.

There's like tons.

But they're covered head to toe other than their dicks are out.

Yeah.

Or it would be like clear plastic.

So it gets kind of sweaty.

Yeah.

It's foggy.

Well guys.

Foggy sausage.

It's called the foggy sausage.

The foggy sausage.

AKA horn dogs.

A lot of restaurants.

The foggy sausage.

Oh my god.

I want to hear Bob doo because list of restaurants next time.

Yeah.

Chain restaurants.

Well, congratulations Stacey.

And then I'd like to dop boys to go to all of them.

Congratulations Stacey.

You have a thousand episodes.

Oh my god.

Thank you.

This is better than I saw.

I guess we're going to release several a day.

Is that how this works?

Yep.

Several three a day.

Three a day.

They come out.

Plus vitamins.

They won't be too long.

They're going to be like no more than two to three hours each.

Oh, yeah.

He's smart.

All right.

Well, look, we are running out of time speaking of not being too long.

We only have time for one final feature on the show.

And that is a little something called plugs.

The fog moves up.

I need to read some plugs today.

You and me to see where we.

Be if we were in marketing, Sky Space Man.

The bag opens up.

Plugs fall out.

There's mother showers pushing you out of mouth.

She says to him, Scottie Arc.

Put the plugs in the bag.

Hot dogs for all.

Nice.

I like that one.

That's a good one.

Okay.

That was a little wrong note to end it on.

That was help.

We are trapped in Scott's basement by Penumbra.

Thank you to Penumbra.

Guys, what do we want to plug?

Jason, what are you plugging here?

I will plug.

I know you mentioned how did this get made earlier.

So, of course, if you haven't listened to it, it's me and Paul.

If you can only listen to one podcast, listen to Comedy Bank.

If you have time for two in your schedule, then get going.

Mosey on over to how did this get made.

Also right here on the Ear Wolf podcast network.

You tell her, Mosey, or?

Well, yes.

Any and all Moseleys.

Not Moseleys.

Mosees.

Who are the Moseleys?

Besides Walter.

Yeah, the author.

Yes, Walter.

Yes, of course.

Tean Tamara.

No, they're Maori's.

Okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

Anyway, oh boy.

So, I will also please, if you guys are out there and you're looking for something to watch.

I know there's a lot of things competing for your eyeballs.

Paper Girls on Amazon.com is absolutely fantastic.

And I show up.

I love the comics.

The Brian K. Vaughan Clifchain comic series that has been adapted is a fantastic time travel story about like four young girls who get kind of pushed into a time war and shunted back and forth through time.

They meet their future selves.

They talk to their future selves.

It's really cool.

And I get to be the villain.

Amazon Prime?

Amazon Prime.

Bob, what do you want to plug?

I also have a podcast.

Oh, that's right.

Full throttle?

Full throttle with Bob Duka with my hapless, hapless engineer Mitchell.

Sort of a feckless cuck.

Oh, yes.

I've listened to the show and the guy seems great.

He's not good at his job.

No, terrible.

I'm mentoring him.

But that's on Comedy Bang Bang World.

And I'd also like to plug your mouth, your jerk.

Oh, man, Bob, you have changed.

Bob, Bob, you have you been doing roast battle?

You know what it is?

I've been jingling Chaga Mushroom Coffee that I...

Chaga Mushroom Coffee.

Chaga Mushroom Coffee that I found out about from Joe Rogan.

It may have raised my testosterone levels.

And that's why I be chewing.

Oh, you're high tea right now.

I'm high tea.

I'm sorry.

Oh, my.

I'm sorry.

I grew up on all those mushrooms.

Stacy buzz up.

Sorry.

Zaba.

Oh, thank you.

That's how you'll intro me.

Because I was thinking you could be my assistant sometimes.

Oh, yes.

Sort of the Mitchell to your Bob?

Exactly.

Okay, I'll see what I can do.

Yeah.

So what are you plugging?

Obviously a thousand episodes.

A thousand episodes of Through a Fly's Eyes starring me Stacy Bazzaba.

I would also like to plug Paper Girls because you've been so supportive.

Oh, thank you.

So much Stacy.

And I'm going to go home and if Scott watches it, I'll watch it.

But that's really the only thing.

I'm going to have to switch home.

I mean, now we're working together so closely.

Go to Jason's house.

He's watching his own stuff.

Come on over.

I watch my stuff all the time.

I bet it's just on repeat.

Oh, yeah.

We can watch the infinite.

We can do so much.

Yes.

And I could get back in the beard.

You know when you go to your old childhood?

Oh, yes.

You still just be here.

It's smaller than what I remember.

Oh, my God.

It's going to be so different.

I can't wait.

It's so much greater than when I was a kid.

Oh, aren't we all?

And then I was plugged Christmas.

Christmas is coming up in December.

Oh, great.

Do you have the concept of Christmas?

The holiday.

Yeah, great.

Yeah.

And then I'd like to just, I'd like to put in a plug for butterflies.

I don't think we need to be as unkind to each other as we all are.

That's nice.

Yeah.

I feel like you are more aware of a butterfly rivalry than the rest of us.

Then the butterflies are.

Because they're so up their own ass.

Oh, my God.

They're just like, look, I used to be a caterpillar.

And now look at me.

They love themselves too much.

Well, they don't get swatted.

And I think that's where it all started.

Yeah, we love butterflies.

Oh, look at this pretty one.

Oh, land on my hands.

Oh, we can't believe how beautiful they are.

We discount their transformation.

From what they were, the caterpillar we kind of discredit is like, ooh, ugly.

Man, I wish you flies turned into something pretty.

Wow.

All right.

Just savage.

See?

Right?

Movie magic.

Could make that happen.

This is real fucking stuff right here.

I mean, you were annoying, but if you were like cute, it would be like a butterfly.

It would be okay.

I really felt like I was cute.

I mean, I look in your mirror when you look in the mirror.

Yeah.

This is begging to be a movie in which now you are either turned into a fly and you guys follow.

Like a Twilight Zone irony.

Or Stacey is turned into a human.

And you guys.

If this were a Twilight Zone, I would like be an astronaut who tries to swat a fly in my spaceship and then I land on a planet where everyone's giant and they try to swat me.

If there was a movie where I turned into a human, what actress would play me that then Scott's character would fall in love with?

Who's an ugly actress?

Okay.

Jesus.

So what you're saying is you only fall in love with ugly actress?

Wow.

Whee.

You stay away from my wife.

I think she showers too often.

She smells too nice.

All right.

I just want to plug.

Okay.

Take one hand, put it in love.

Take the other put it in kiss.

You're gonna make a shot.

It's time to start to close it.

But don't close it too much.

Are you open up that plug?

Open up that plug.

Open up that plug bag.

Open up my heart for the rest of the kissing.

I'm talking open up the plug bag.

Open up that plug bag.

As I ask you again, can you open up your heart?

My son's dead.

Thank you.

Okay, that is the first plug bag theme stuff that I've liked, mostly because it's a Martin Sheffield Lickley song.

It's mostly I'm enjoying it because of that reference.

Well, that was the look of plug by Always Be Cuddling.

Thank you so much to them for that wonderful plug scene and closing up the plug bag theme.

I can't recommend enough people re-listening to those, the episodes with Martin Sheffield Lickley and Memphis, Kansas Breeze.

Oh, yeah.

It's a story with us too.

Repeatedly through the pandemic to get me out of bad moods.

Yeah, fantastic.

Well, guys, I want to thank you so much, Jay.

It's always great to have you.

Thrilled to be here.

What a delight.

Back in the studio.

Maybe your final episode is in the studio.

Last episode of Comedy Bay and Bob.

Thanks for having me.

I want to see a change in your attitude next time you're on the show.

Okay, please, please have me back.

Okay, I will.

Definitely.

Hello to your mother.

And Stacy Bazzzzaba.

You have got it down.

Yeah. Thanks for having me.

Thanks for having me.

And speaking of getting it down, my hand is coming down.

Oh, that's right.

That's right.

Oh.

I got her.

I killed her.

Oh.

It's gone.

Why would you do this?

Oh, now I feel terrible.

I mean, I got to know her, I got to know her personally.

I just, but the savage part of my brain, just my snake brain, my reptile brain, just like.

Let's get out of here, bub.

Let's go.

Get on my back.

And he's chucking mushrooms.

Our savage.

We'll leave you to what you've done, Scott.

How did you get so jacked?

Oh my god.

All right.

Well, everyone's gone.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.

Bye.

Thank you.
