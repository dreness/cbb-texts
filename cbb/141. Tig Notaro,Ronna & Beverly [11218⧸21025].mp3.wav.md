Good one. That's what you'll be saying after this week's episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

That's right, Tig Notaro is here. One of our fan favorites is here. She won best female character last year, and she is back to spread her joy. Also, a couple of visitors from another time in place are going to be joining us a little later. All that and more, all on today's...

Are you man enough to date tall women? Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Thanks for that catchphrase submission. DC submitted that on the earwolf boards. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. This is Comedy Bang Bang after dark. We have a nice sunset right behind us. In the new earwolf studios, we overlook kind of a church bell tower kind of thing. And there's a beautiful sunset and the mountains are behind there. And I feel like I'm really painting the picture by saying beautiful sunset over and over. What's up? My name is the world famous Scott about, of course, aka the Chuck Tau. And I have a fantastic show for you whenever you're listening to it. I would suggest listen to it at sunset. There's a lot of beautiful sunsets out there in the world. Why don't you nab yourself one and make a nice mint julep? And my guest is staring at me in horror, like what is the hole I'm digging for myself? You want to say anything into that, Mike?

I didn't, you know, I never am sure on this show if I'm supposed to talk. Cause I remember in when it was at 103, Indy, 103, one, and I don't mean to be plugging a radio station. That fired you.

And in turn, like I lost a lot of my income after Indy, 103, one went down. But when I would go into that studio for the show, I would, you know, I'd just show up into the studio and people would be talking. I'd be like, oh, hey, I'm here. And you'd be like, shh. Well, yeah, running a little late.

Well, normally, no, I don't want the guests to talk until I mention them. And yet I don't want them to stare at me creepily while I'm trying to talk. But I was thinking, well, I'm sure soon enough, Scott will stop his cute little mint julep story. But it does look like an Eagles record right outside the window here. It really does. Specifically Hotel California, where you can see Anton LaVey up there in the old church. The old minister of magic.

Miniature of magic, you almost said.

The miniature minister of magic, head of Ravenclaw, Anton LaVey. I do want to introduce you before we get too much further.

Did you say my name yet?

No, I have not.

Oh, why don't we just skip that?

Say your name, say your name.

No, let's not say it.

I don't want people to be confused about you. I want people to picture your loveliness as you talk. I know you have a very distinctive monotonal voice that people- I've never heard that.

Distinctive or monotonal.

I've actually never heard any of those words you've used.

I am saying English words right now, though.

No idea. I've never heard those words.

No.

What is your name?

Caller.

Caller, go ahead. That's what I say when I answer my phone. When I answer my cell phone, I just say, caller, go ahead.

First time, long time.

My name is Tig Notaro.

Tig Notaro is here. Fan favorite. You know her as the good one robot.

Good one.

You know her as the woman who's been married for 40 years.

Yeah.

Answering a question. You know her as the drapery puller.

You know her as the car- Professor.

Car horn.

No, it's a clown horn.

Well, don't you do a car horn? Come on, kind of expand.

Meep, meep.

That one?

Yeah, that's not as good.

What a- One from the thirties. A car horn from the thirties.

Model T.

A model T. That's what I am.

Yeah, you are the model T.

Model T.

But perhaps- oh, yes, of course, the spring.

Perhaps most importantly, you know her from- she has a podcast in her own right here on the Earwolf Network. Professor Blastoff.

I'm cat clapping.

You're cat clapping.

I'm cat clapping.

You can put your hands into paws.

I use all four paws.

Would you like a little saucer of milk while you cat clap?

You can only put milk into a saucer if a cat is drinking it.

That's true.

Yeah.

I don't know what that means.

Let's go to commercial.

Caller?

Go ahead. Yeah.

Yeah.

What is the other side? What is the guy saying in that- In the 40 year- Is he calling- yeah, is he calling her name?

It can be anything. I always picture that- Because me and my wife do this all the time as well.

You do what?

The constant, what?

Or- Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah. So you can be anywhere in the house.

It's just that you're married for so long that you're just in your head.

And, you know, her husband is maybe just right around the corner.

Sure.

Just- let's say the laundry room is just right around the corner and he's getting his underwear out of the laundry room. And he says, sweetie- Did a special load of just underwear?

Yeah. Yeah. Filthy underwear. And he just says, sweetie? Yeah!

Come smell this underwear for me.

Let me know if it's clean.

Yeah. So it can be anything and you can be saying her name from anywhere in the house.

And what is her name? Has that ever been established in this?

Well, it's based on a real person named- Who you had on your show, as I recall. Or no, the daughter of which.

That was her daughter.

Yeah. It's Molly's mother. My friend Tony is here in the studio.

Tony, Tony, Tony. Give a wave to the fine folks, if you would.

Yeah. Wave to everybody in the world.

Tony is my dear friend from Denver and I've known him about 20 years.

Wow.

More than 22 years.

You must have been in grade school.

Uh, that's correct. And so he- I'm talking to Tony, not to you.

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking to me during this interview.

No, I know you were about 25.

Have you been talking to Tony this whole time I've been on the show?

I have. Yeah. Why do you keep interrupting? Tony, get in on this.

So Tony is in town from Denver and he and I are friends with Molly and it's Molly's mother, Nora Ellen, who is- You're imitating.

Yeah. And then her daughter, Katie, was a guest on Professor Blast Off.

And when I go to shows, you know, people come up and be like, you know, we say yeah.

And I'm like, yeah. And they're like, yes. And then they run off into the darkness.

It has all the earmarks of a great story. It has a cast of characters.

It has a saucer of milk.

An overarching plot.

It has Nora Ellen.

Nora Ephron did a little punch up on it.

Mm-hmm.

Tig Notaro, comedian.

It's actually No-Taro.

Nuh.

It's not Nuh.

Notaro. It's not the schwa.

It's No-Taro.

Tig Notaro.

No, no, no. It's No-Taro.

Tig Notaro.

That's correct.

Catch us up. You haven't been on this program in a little while.

Yeah.

We've traveled a bit. We went to Washington together at the Gorge at Sasquatch Festival.

Oh, okay. You meant literally we have traveled together, me and you.

Yeah. You and I have traveled together.

Okay. Yeah.

We were on a plane coming back. We collected luggage.

Yes. I forgot that we've traveled, but we have. I thought you were saying it like, we've been traveling, haven't we? Meaning I have been.

I don't talk like that. Come on.

Listen, I thought you were.

When I say something, I mean it.

Okay.

We've traveled together since you've been on the show, but catch the listeners up on where you've been, what you've been doing.

I had a CD come out that was called Good One.

Compact Disc.

Compact Discus.

And it's called Good One because of the character that you created on this show.

But also, that's what people say after jokes, which is what I was saying to you, mocking you.

That is the origin of the Good One robot is you were mocking some sort of horrible joke I made.

I can't remember the specifics.

I think just anything you said. I just said Good One.

People love that you give it right back to me, Tig.

Mm-hmm.

You know, because I put it out there, I give as hard as I get. You know that.

I know it, girl.

Girl.

So yeah, my CD came out and then I did a tour all around this United States of America.

What's your favorite state?

Craziness.

Yeah, well, we're going to go to commercial.

Where's that robot?

Good one.

We just touched feet, by the way.

Oh, I know.

Electricity.

You know how everything you say you mean, everything I do, I mean.

Ooh, hello.

Hi. I love, you know what, I was just in Iowa with Tom Sharp, the very funny comedian, Tom Sharp.

Love Tom.

So funny.

Say hello.

Hi, Tom.

Tom. Oh, this is one side.

Okay. So I was in Iowa and Wisconsin and all sorts of states.

Now that is the state, Iowa, with an owl in the middle, right?

It does. It has an owl right in the middle of it. It is beautiful.

I've never been. I've never noticed your accent.

I'm from Iowa, of course.

Oh, okay.

But I've never been there.

Oh, okay. Well, yeah, it's just beautiful farmland and Tom's originally from there and we did a three-week college tour.

I swear you were going to say three-way.

Yes. Me, Tom, and his parents switched on and off. It was very hot.

That's a three and a half way.

Yeah, it was a four-way. So can I tell you on one of the college shows that we did?

I will allow it.

Thank you. I'm doing this show in a college classroom.

I do a lot. Sometimes my show is in a theater. Sometimes it's a weird situation.

Well, I'm doing one show in a classroom. This woman walks in with a bag of books all in her hands and I had been, for some reason or another, I guess, because I do comedy, somehow the word nut sack came up in my show.

In the show previous to her entering.

Yeah. So we were kind of making some nut sack chatting, me and the audience.

Nut sack chat.

Nut sack chat with Tig.

We'll be right back.

Let's go to commercial. So I'm doing the show.

Professor Blastoff, you're canceled. Nut sack chat.

With Tig Notaro. So I'm doing the show and this woman walks in the side door holding a bunch of books in her hands and she says something to me and I said, yeah, I said to her, I says, yeah.

And she said something about if I was in the class or something and I said, yeah, yeah, class is going on and she said, no, the anatomy class. I said, yes, this is an anatomy class.

We were just discussing nut sacks. Come on in. And she was looking at me so confused and then all of a sudden droves of people started walking into the room and what had happened was the person that booked me to do a show at the college had booked me during class time.

Had no idea.

Yeah, it was double booked. I had done about 40 minutes of my show or maybe just 30 or something and now that was the professor. She had no sense of humor, walked right past me, turned on the overhead projector and started talking to the class and I kept walking around on the stage area discussing nut sacks.

Simultaneously.

Yes. And I was ignoring her and she was ignoring me.

It was a total standup comedy and anatomy college class mashup.

You asked Tom Sharp. It was the most amazing thing.

How long did this go on?

I would say a good five minutes, which doesn't sound long, but it was long.

That's a long time.

It was long. And what happened was as people from the class came in, I would go meet them at the door and walk next to them because I had a cordless mic and just walk next to them telling my jokes and discussing nut sacks and welcoming them to their anatomy class.

Now the professor didn't make her pause that you had a wireless mic on you.

We were all so confused by her behavior. I'm sure as much as she was confused about my behavior, why there was some woman walking around with a cordless mic discussing nut sacks and following her students around.

What if she just thought that you were a student who brought her own microphone just to be hilarious and she was trying to teach you a lesson?

I really don't know what she thought was happening, but the advisor or whatever that booked me there came up and was like, we need to wrap this up. Come on, let's go.

And so I was kind of excited that I didn't have to do a whole hour because sometimes the grind of one hour worked. So I'm like, whew, I get out of here in 40 minutes.

That's a new impression.

Whew, that's wind blowing. That's sailing in the ocean with a nice wind blowing.

So did the professor ever get clued into what happened or any sort of epilogue to this story?

The advisor just scooted me out saying we need to get out of here.

What about the crowd who was gathered there to watch you?

They started to exit also.

And they didn't feel ripped off that the whole hour didn't...

I don't know. Look, I got paid full cash.

Full price.

Full price. Got out of there.

Full cash, as we say in the biz.

As we say in the college anatomy.

Do you have full cash for me?

Yeah. But no, we just all stood out there in a what just happened moment.

That's incredible.

I've never had a class start in the middle of my show.

I love stories like that. Every comedian seems to have one, but rarely as good as that.

So congratulations.

Thank you.

Let's take some calls.

Tony, you on the line?

All right. Let's take a break. What do you say when we come back?

We'll have another couple of guests here.

Can we wait a few minutes before we take a break?

Okay. Yeah.

Let's go to a break.

All right. Let's go to a break.

I only wish, but unfortunately it's her job at this point Are you serious?

Not kidding Because guess what?

That marriage is going to fall right apart You think so?

Why?

If you don't go home and get a cleaning lady You guys don't do housework Absolutely not He has the secret to a good relationship Always having a cleaning lady and separate bathrooms That is the secret to a good relationship I was on the second half of that and I actually, when we did have the cleaning lady I gave that advice to a lot of people It saves so much stress on a relationship And you had a cleaning lady Now you're too cheap She went back to Guatemala, unfortunately You know why?

There isn't another one waiting in line behind her I've never met one Are you serious?

Are you serious?

You live in Los Angeles and there's no one else you can find to clean your house for 10 cents?

I'll clean it Here's something You have to also make sure that your cleaning ladies have separate bathrooms That's very important Yeah, for the help I love that movie Such a good movie I left before the end, but it was so good before the end Nud for me What's simpler times? A movie?

The help It was a simpler time I have a cleaning lady Good for you No, it's a man Really?

Everything's backwards in your world A cleaning human Yeah, it's like a bizarro world You know what I mean You know what I mean?

Because you think you're in a good marriage I do, I think being honest with you Yeah I think mutual respect Okay And trust Okay, that's it?

You seem...

Well, I know for a fact she doesn't respect you I mean, honestly, I'm going to say something And I know it's going to be a little controversial I feel that she was probably a little uncomfortable with a Guatemalan person around Oh, yeah, probably Or the Guatemalan was uncomfortable that an Asian person was telling her what to do I mean, that's a whole thing We're actually not talking about the cleaning people Oh, what were you talking about?

Yeah, the mutual respect and everything That was based on me and my wife I was asking him about the secrets to a good relationship and he gave me two very trite answers Trite answers? No, I honestly believe those are the cornerstones I mean, that's a basic A basic? What do you mean?

Like, that's a basic food group?

There has to be respect Are you asking, like, what the dessert of a relationship is?

If there's no respect, there's no marriage If there's no communication, there's no marriage But what's the secret for you two?

But that is the secret You say there is no marriage without those Exactly, that's the secret of having a marriage Are you a generous lover?

Do you believe in the rest of your life?

No, are you like Brad Pitt, you think we're Finau?

We're doing what we're doing Is that what Brad Pitt thinks?

Brad Pitt thinks you're together as long as you're together Gwyneth Paltrow, she's another one You're together till you're not together I want to rip it off her face I mean, that's not really a healthy attitude I think, yeah, why not?

The rest of your life So what made you think she was the person that you should spend the rest of your life with?

I say, yeah, why not?

The rest of your life Sure Am I sighing enough when I talk about this?

Well, no, it's not hard to speak I mean, I'm not going to take that as an indication of how you feel about her I mean, what about children?

It's an uncomfortable question It's a probing question What about children?

What about them?

You know what I mean?

Exactly Yeah, see, you answered your own question Yeah Yeah, I think the rest of your life and what was it about her?

I think that, you know, I just wanted to take care of her and make sure that nothing happened Good for her She evoked some kind of compassion in you Yeah, she was able to stir that honeypot somehow And miraculously, you felt so moved you wanted to take care of her and then you stopped paying for a cleaning lady You want to hear something funny?

Now I've heard everything Can I say something?

You want to hear something funny?

Okay, I'd love to You're a terrible husband if that's what we're talking about Black people, please bevel it As individuals, I like them very much, not as much in a group Asians, the opposite Great in a group at Disneyland Like you head down to Chinatown and just party it up Individually, one-on-one She likes Chinese food Who's interested?

What about Laos?

One single Laos I can't even, honestly The truth is that's sort of Southeast Asian anyway, that's not exactly Asian, that's another thing She feels like a palm tree Asian You know what I mean?

No, this is a long story that we don't necessarily have time to get into But can I ask, am I fixed?

Listen, I think you've taken some very valuable advice away with you I don't know what advice other than the cleaning lady This was more for people that are listening how not to do things This was more of a learn by example situation And you were setting a somewhat negative example And you think my relationship is doomed?

Well, I would have to talk to her, but I think that you're not really pulling my side Do you ever clean the house?

I think you're not being quite as compassionate as you could be Look, and this is the truth, we got a lot of new appliances We redid the kitchen and the laundry room Wonderful And I don't know how to work anymore So what, you got a lot of new listeners on CBB?

Is that how you were able to get all those appliances?

Comedy, bang, bang, bang, bang It's a podcast And you don't know how to use them I don't know how to use them But she does She knows how to use them Right, so you're not going to take the time to learn basically Well, she basically took the deliveries of them She was around, I was working like a man How is she able to It's very interesting And she took the deliveries and she must have had all the manuals She studied them Woe manuals, woe manuals Sorry, woe manuals She studied them, figured out how to work these appliances Thank you, Lilith And then she, I don't know where the I don't know where the manuals, woe manuals Is this how you see the world entirely?

On the DVD In your red box you were talking about, you can get it What I was going to say was that all I find unusual about her husband's death Is that it occurred during one of the most relaxing activities a person could possibly encounter Pony rides?

No, snorkeling, it's like having a massive coronary in the middle of an aquarium It's very relaxing, I mean if there had been bungee jumping I'd have understood You have a number of tasteless qualities But I would say the top of the list is that you love to talk about how my husband passed away No, I don't, I don't love it You do not miss an opportunity Are you saying that you suspect foul play?

Yes, I am Do you think she put her hand over that little snorkel?

No, I don't think that you caused it, no The best way to kill a snorkeler, by the way Just stick a finger right in that thing?

Absolutely not, I would never imply that There's no way to get out of that That is foolproof That's right Rofa, is your husband alive?

Rona And pants You said Rona earlier No, you said Rona Okay, Rona And you said is it Rona or Rona and I said it's Rona and you said Rona You know, check the tape, you said it's Rona No, I'm pretty sure I said my own name correctly But you are the boss So tonight it's Rona Which is good, pants or mustard?

Pants or mustard, exactly, so what do you give it?

Pants I'm guessing is thumbs up What do you give it?

We need a rating, not discussion about the rating I give it like two mustards or something like that We need you to rate the song Between either pants or mustard We need you to rate, what I'm asking you is please rate the song It's terrible, is that pants or mustard?

Pants or mustard, what I need you to do is rate the song Between pants and mustard Who's on first, who's on first?

What I'm asking you to do is describe what you thought of the song using your rating But is the system pants or mustard?

What I need you to do currently is to use your mouth to use the rating And then we can move on Mustard Mustard, we got mustard, alright Beverly, how do you like to...

Oh mustard, mustard, mustachioed mustard Two mustards Pants for sure Pants Pants, ugh I'm gonna give that a pants as well, so we're two and two, alright He's still in the game?

Split decision, split decision on put your ladies in the car Let's move on to our next song, it is by Jonathan Finn I maybe don't want to say the title of this before we...

Might give away the joke Might give away the joke, so let's just hear this, Jonathan Finn Rudimentary guitar playing I was with a new lover making out on the couch when Things got a little heated and my penis came out and She jerked and pulled on it until it was raw I said you fucking bitch, your hand does not belong there at all You gotta suck it, fuck it Mustard Alright, three of us, we have a chorus I don't care for bitch, I don't care ever for the word I like that story Yeah, you know why I didn't like it It's a tale as old as time She had to have been mentally challenged because this is how he plays guitar And she was doing it with him I'm lucky that anyone is putting anything anywhere near him So don't bite the hand that's feeding your penis Don't bite the hand that yanks you Yanks you, exactly Alright, I think we all agree on this But I will have to ask for a rating Can we do a mashup between that song and the other song?

I don't believe we can, I don't think we have the capability How many schmucks do this submit to you every week? How does this work?

Oh, constantly, this is the absolute worst feature we do on the show I don't know why anyone would submit to it But our plug songs are way better than any song that has been submitted I'm going to say I don't think we've ever in the history of the show liked a single song Pants But pants is your rating?

Yeah, for sure, that was an obvious pants Beverly, how do you like to?
