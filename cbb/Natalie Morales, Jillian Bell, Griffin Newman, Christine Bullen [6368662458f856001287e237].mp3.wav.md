♪♪♪ Diddle, diddle, dumpling. My whole world is crumbling. My pants are on and I'm in the bed.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Thank you to, oh gosh, I closed my phone and didn't even see who did.

Thank you to Slippery Gibby. All right, for that castphrase you've missed in. Thank you to Slippery Gibby and welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Happy Navi doggy to you. First week in Navi doggy. It's an exciting time to be alive. You got Thanksgiving coming up right at the end. Other stuff before that, I can try to straining to think of anything else that happens in November. Anything?

The puppy bowl? The puppy bowl. Wait, no, I think the puppy bowl is in...

Is that one the Super Bowl in January?

Yeah, that would be the February.

Oh wait, then what's the game that they play on Thanksgiving Day?

Oh, the lingerie bowl?

Oh, maybe it's the puppy parade?

There's a puppy parade?

There's actually a dog show which is different than what I'm thinking of, but I do enjoy the dog show. Yes, the dog show is the one where they pointed the dogs and then they shoot them in the face. Yeah, and they go, okay, who can take it? 50 Cent style.

That's the saddest joke I've ever made.

Anyway, Thanksgiving coming up, we'll see you there. But before we get there, my name is Scott Archiben. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. We have a great show coming up a little later. We have a writer. We also have a YouTube reviewer. Hmm, she was really going downhill.

But we did, but I do have to say the stars are back. The stars had flocked away from Comedy Bang Bang for so long during the pandemic. Well, they wanted to do it over Zoom and that was fine, but then when it was in my backyard, they were like, hell no other than Anders Holm, who came the wrong day, came the day before we were supposed to record. To his credit, came back the next day. But other than that, no stars in the backyard, but now we're back in the studio. The stars are back. They have appeared on the show separately. And now they have combined into some sort of Voltron. If Voltron were only two parts, like the bottom half and the top half into a Voltron-like team and they're appearing together, if you can believe it, promoting their new movie called I'm Totally Fine, which came out on Friday.

They're here. I'm so glad that they are here. They're two of my favorites. Please welcome Natalie Morales and Jillian Bell. Hello.

Hello. Hi, Scott. It's nice to see you again. It is so nice to see you again. What was the last time? I feel like it was in that room over there. It was a while ago. I mean, all the rooms here look the same. I can't tell you, but it was a while ago. It was a while ago. What were you doing here last time? I don't remember. The fuck knows. I didn't know. Was it successful? Was it appearing on the show? If I was on it, it probably got canceled. Was it the one where you were a bartender? Maybe. Maybe it was Abby's also canceled. Yeah.

Cancelled though. How many did you do?

I think we did one season. That's canceled. Okay. Yeah.

Because people say to me, like, oh, your show was canceled. I do a 110 episodes. The only shows that haven't been canceled are 60 minutes in the Simpsons. Yes. And I guess anything else that's on TV. Yes. And Jillian, you were here talking about Idiot Sitter last time you were here. Yeah.

That was probably like 2017 or something.

Yeah. That was in our old place upstairs. That was back in the old world. Yeah. And we, of course, know you both as wonderful performers. Natalie, you're a director in your own right. Yes.

And just directed two movies last year, I believe. Yes.

Amazing movies. Thank you. Incredible.

Did you say like, okay, I'll take six months to direct this one and six months to direct this one, or how did you break that up? No, they both happened at the same time, kind of. You drew. Oh, really?

So it was like the first take was for this movie. Yes. It's like a Scorsese one for me, one for them.

Yeah. I was, I was, I had this sort of like a, like a, like a, you know, you know, those thick poster boards that they use for science fairs. Oh, yes, I know. I had someone cut that up in the shape of my profile. And then I had it right in the middle of my face, right? And then on one side, on my left side, I was doing one movie. And then on my right side, I was doing another.

Oh, okay. It's the most efficient way to direct like two-face or like those, those pictures you see of the guy who's a groom on one side and a bride on the other. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

It's, it's, I mean, if you really want to be prolific, it's what you have to do. You have to these days, especially with screens getting smaller, paychecks getting smaller. Everything's getting smaller, except the talent. And you two are two of the most talented out there right now.

Jillian, of course, we know you. My wife and I watched Brittany runs a marathon during the pandemic, where he lifted our spirits, great movie. I would suggest everyone to go out there and watch that. Did you take a brownie? No. Oh, so I guess I didn't inspire you. I got my spirits, not my actual body. I was like, yeah, good for her. And now you've, you've come together.

Did you know each other before? We did. We did, we did a little bit of kind of bad sketch comedy, like, like. Is there any other kind? It was for, it was for a charity. And then, and we were just like, I really like you. Yeah. And then we're like, let's never see each other, except for once in a while at a random industry party. And we go, oh, it's you. Yeah. And then, and then that was it until we made this movie. Wow. What was the charity that you were?

Did they solve whatever problem it was? I don't know if it was a, was it like American Cancer Society or was it one specific person's cancer bill? I think it might have been that the second one.

Yes. Yeah. I can't remember. A particular person who had cancer had a huge medical bill, and you guys came together. I, I, if we want to feel altruistic about it. Yes, I think that was it. It was definitely for cancer. I just don't know which direction to win. I don't know if it got spread among everyone. But I know that the person is okay. The person's fine. The person's good. The person's great. Well, no, the person's an asshole, but what time? Was it a Harvey wife? No, no, no, no. He's not that much of an asshole. Oh, okay. He's like halfway to all of you. He exists. We saved his life. We, we, I'm being very mean right now. I mean, I wish you're making this person. I mean, I wish him well.

I don't like him, but I wish him well.

Interesting. Why did you not like him at the time? I was fine with him at the time. But since then you're no longer fine. Since then, I've been like, oh, should have killed you. No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I couldn't be wider.

So this person, if they're listening, I don't wish you were dead. No, I'm joking. I don't like you, but I don't, I don't wish you were dead. I'm happy. I hope the internet sleuths out there are not figuring out who this person is. I don't care. You don't care. Who is it? I'm not going to say.

Oh, you do care. No, I don't want his name to be tarnished by me. I'm going to leave someone for you. We're coming for you. No, I'm glad you'll be able to nose down. No, he's an asshole. So interesting. It wouldn't be hard to sleuth out. All right.

I cannot wait for the break when I find out who this man is. I don't think you know him. Oh, okay.

Yeah. Why? Because I'm so unpopular. I don't know. No, no, he's kind of a nobody. I just tried to impress Jillian. I feel my hands are sweating so hard. And it's freezing in here. I again, and being mean, I did not mean that.

He's not a nobody. He's a person. He's a very. You're acting out to impress Jillian because Jillian's very cool. Yeah. Because Jillian's the sweetest person and I like being an asshole in front of you because I like talking here. I'm being very mean right now. I will say this person was, you know, emotionally and verbally abusive to almost everyone he knew.

So I do feel a little entitled in not liking him. Sure. If you could take back doing that benefit, would you? Jillian, I'll just destroy Jillian.

If you could go back and not do the terrible sketch comedy thing. No, I would have done it a movie. You would have done it. Jillian. Yeah. And I think there was other really nice people that did that. And I, you know, I'm glad we raised money for either him or cancer in general. Yeah.

Yeah. Although you wish it was cancer in general. We probably raised like $20. It was like a local small LA show. It was like us dancing around to like, Blink 182. Well, I wish it was Blink 182. I love Blink 182. It was like, we did some sketch about playing video games, I feel like. Of course, because it was written by men. Yeah. Show with men. Yeah.

Oh, wait. So a bunch of men wrote some sketches and then made you do them. Yeah. And they're all about stuff you would never do like playing video games. Yeah. I like this new stuff. I mean, literally, I would be like, here's an idea I wrote and they're like, go fuck yourself. You're the lead and period party, the sketch. I literally have that on my IMDB and I don't know how to get it off. Oh my god. And then contest it. And then like four years later, I was writing on SNL and I was like, this is pretty cool. And they were like, I guess, SNL sucks these discs. They're like, it sucks.

Yeah. You suck. I was like, okay. Anyway, we wish everyone well. Everyone's we really came off as monsters in this podcast. I haven't heard over. Jillian can attest that I'm a, I think I'm a nice person. Oh, she's a lovely person. That's why this is wild this interview. I mean, I came off swinging. I mean, it's, I just feel pretty strongly that I don't like this person. I just don't know how you're, how both of us are not about getting canceled. I love that this is press for your movie too. We're talking about this.

It's like a heartfelt, I know, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry. You are, you are two of the the nicest from what I have heard. Not from this. Not from the last 10 minutes.

Who's going to think that now? It's all me. I know. We really dug that grave. CBB listeners, you've heard me before. I've been, I've been awesome. You've been on one. I'm not allowed to not like a person. Exactly. Was I like, there's a misogynist? I don't like half the people who come into this into this show. Do you like us? I like you too. I only am going to like the next two. Great. Is it because we were assholes today? Yeah, I love it.

Speaking of assholes, I'm totally fine.

Features a cast of people who own assholes. Who are us?

Tell me about the movie. I must confess, things in my life have gone upside down and pear shaped and I've not seen the movie. But I have seen the trailer. I'll tell you that much. We can all agree.

It's kind of like seeing the movie.

Yeah. It's basically the movie. Yeah. Right. I mean, it doesn't give you the end.

No, that's why you cut off the movie. Yeah, exactly. It cuts off right before the end.

Look, trailers are known to do that. Yeah. And it's a shitty thing. Although, I have seen a trailer recently that the very last line of the movie is in the trailer. Was it the movie, Dout? Dout the one about the Catholic priest? Yeah, with my old street. She just goes, I have doubt.

The last line of the movie. And the last line of the trailer. I laughed so hard. I don't know if it's the last line of the trailer, but it did maybe laugh that the last line of the movie was just like, I have doubt. The way it could be like, I'm four is go. And that was credit.

Is the last line of your movie? I'm totally fine. I don't think you ever even say it. I'm finally totally fine. We don't ever say it in the movie. We don't ever say it. We never say the title in the movie. Why is it called that then? You'll see. You got to see the movie. Yeah, you got to see it.

Oh, you're so good at selling it. I know. So this is some sort of mystery. Why it's called, I'm totally fine. In other words, I'm and totally and fine in order. Probably. Yeah, probably there.

Okay. Someone could, you know, smash cut them together. I'm totally fine. It's probably like that.

I'm totally fine. Yeah.

Do you want us to tell you what this movie is about? I'm too big. You're not sure.

Because I saw the trailers I know. Right. Right. It sounds like you were asking us.

It sounds like a waste of my time. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, go ahead, please. Okay.

Hi. I wrote it's a jillion Bell. The nice one. The nice one.

I took over the old meanie jillion Bell. Okay. So I play a woman who is grieving the loss of her best friend who passed away. And passed away recently. It seemed like in the trailer. Yes.

Yes. And I go to an Airbnb to just get away from it all. But I can't get away from it all because I wake up in the morning and there in the kitchen is my dead best friend played by Natalie Morales, the good one.

And she's making me pancakes. And she's also claiming that she's not my dead best friend.

She has taken the body of my dead best friend and she's in fact an alien. Go see it now.

There we go. And now now is she taken the body like she's exhumed the body. I don't know.

I don't think so. I don't think so. I still in the ground.

I just copied it.

Yeah. That's what it felt like. It didn't feel like a dead like I'm like a dead man walking.

You don't have like pale skin roaming around a grave. Right.

Are you like a shape shifter? Are you a scroll? I think it's that kind of thing.

You could. I have the technology to take the body of. And technically you could shape shift in anything then. I don't know. Like a building.

Sure. A building. Yeah. I do know that the alien has everything is exactly the same except for the coccyx bone. Oh interesting.

Yeah. So I don't know what the deal is with that. But I always pick someone asked me in an interview today what the alien looks like when it doesn't look like Jennifer. Yeah. I always pictured it like a just a blob with one bone in it. Just one. I just won. Wait. You want a femur?

Like a femur like bone. Just no. Not a spine. Just one hard bone.

I just like my bone. My bone. That's so cute. I think sure it is like.

Not humanoid. Almost like ghost writer like flaming.

Bony. Yeah. Yeah. Like muscley. Yeah. That's really funny.

Is it. Do you ever see the actual craft that the alien comes down in? No. So. I guess I should know you. Yeah. Or perhaps you're able to travel interdimensional or not interdimensionally but throughout our space just with your body because you're just. People pick me up. Really. People pick me up and drop me off. They keep dropping off. Okay.

Be back here at three thirty.

And then if my parents drop me off and then they pick you up.

Yeah. And I'm sure that the reason that you come down and do this is. Is. Is.

Is. Talked about the movie or. Yeah. It's very confusing.

Yeah. Yeah. It's for a reason.

I think it's in the trailer that you're. Is it. Is it. Ish.

It's ish in the trailer. Some tests.

We can say that. Yeah. Some tests. Yeah. Sure. It. Does that intrigue you? Does that make you want to buy it? Soil tests. Yes. Yeah. Soil tests. Test.

Intrigue. That's a good movie.

Well my parents really gone upside down. So. But really it's a movie about the relationship between the two of you and and Julie I guess it's the relationship between not only this being that you're now with but also your relationship with your ex best friend and how you're dealing with it. Yeah. Yeah. It's. This is my guess. It is. No. You're.

You've. Good. You've watched the movie. I mean I were writing the movie. That's what I would do but I don't know what who wrote this.

Alicia Keytree. I thought you were gonna say Alicia Keys.

Alicia Keys. She's like some people wanted a. And here's a script. An alien film. And who. Oh wait. What was that? That was a song or Alicia Keys song. Your listeners will know it. You know that part. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. It's very hard to say. She wasn't for me. It's so crazy. It's so.

Wasn't for me if you heard that.

No. You were great at it. Thank you.

Should we have a singing competition report? I think you should. Yeah. Like should we pick a bass line? I don't know. You took yourself out of it.

Something that you. Yeah. Oh wait. You and me.

Yeah. All the three of us. Oh the three of us. Sure. Yeah.

What's a what's a line for the song we all do? Okay. Let's see. What about I can't get no satisfaction but you have to do it exactly.

Like Mick. Like Mick. God. He's one of the world's greatest from it. I don't know. Okay.

I mean it's it's worth shouting than singing but yeah. Well he does it a few times. Sometimes it's soft. How about something from the greatest love of all Whitney. Okay. Okay. Okay. I believe that's a real challenge. Are the future. Okay. Great. Okay.

About that. All right. So which part though?

Just that part that he just said? That part. That part. I believe the children are the future.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Who has the bravery to go first? Gillian suggested it. Yeah. Okay.

Go first. I don't know if I can. I believe the children are future. I like it.

Teach them well and let them lead the way. Wow. Thank you.

I love it. Okay. Natalie. Oh God. Okay.

Gonna grip the mic. Yeah.

Yeah. Look at you. All right. Everyone look away. I'll root your eyes.

I think it makes it worse. It does make it worse. Look at you. Look at me.

Don't want to hear me. Okay. There's so much pressure. I know so many bits.

I know. Just go now. I believe the children are future.

Wow. You ran out over three times in one sentence.

Did you say it some more? Wow. I think I know who the winner is. Okay. Wait. You're up.

Sorry. I got it. I got lightheaded. I believe the children are for you.

John. Teach them well and the way. Wow. Oh my God. There are so many different singers in that.

Yeah. There is Michael McDonald in there. Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. A little bit.

I believe the children are future. Yeah. All right. I don't want to.

I don't want to. We should vote for who won each of us vote and you can vote for yourself.

You can or can. You can. Oh, you can. I mean, I'm going to vote for myself.

Yeah. I'm going to vote for myself. It's a three-way time.

Well, equally good singers. It turns out. Great. I agree.

From the voters.

I agree. Yes. It's the people's choice.

How did people get this film? I'm totally fine. You were sitting, Natalie, you said something really interesting to me before the show.

You said, it's in select theaters. I got to file that away and talk about that on the show.

Yeah. Which means it's not in all the theaters. It's just in select.

It's not in everyone. No. Okay. So they went around the film company.

Yeah. And they sold. The distributors. They went around.

They were picky. This one. Not that one. This one.

Right. Right. It's interesting.

The markets that they felt deserved it. Interesting. Wow.

You learned so much about the business on this show. Yeah. And then you can also see it on demand, if you know how to. Upon request is what I like to say.

Because I think on demand is.

I don't know. If anyone knows how to do on demand. It implies to.

It's very pushiness. I think it means that you have cable still and I do.

Yeah. You have cable still. And then you can also rent it or buy it on.

Is iTunes still a thing? Or is it iTunes? Is it just Apple and Apple?

And then Amazon, I believe you can also rent stuff in.

Yeah. You can also like. Go fuck yourself.

Yeah. You want to fuck yourself.

You're just singing contest with us. Yeah. You put your hand in the fire.

And every hundredth person who watches this movie, you've guaranteed you'll do a singing contest with. Is that right? Correct. Yes. Okay. Great. And you'll come to their house?

I was reading. They had to show us proof that they were the hundred, 200th.

Yeah. We still haven't figured out how they're going to be able to prove that.

Yeah. But because it doesn't come up like when I rent something on Apple movies, it's not like you're the 1,368,000. Right.

Wouldn't be cool. Is that like a DJ answers the phone and goes, your number 68? You know, yeah. Like when you call. One more and you got something.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Six and I is the real winner.

Colors. 69 wins a pair of tickets to Michael McDonald.

So and how much, how much should we talk in? Like, you know, what's a movie ticket cost these days?

I think it's only like what we're fighting.

Flation. To buy this on like on Apple or or or what's the Amazon? It's like $14, which is cheaper than a movie ticket and you get to watch it in your own home.

And you can invite people over. And you can, yeah, it's one ticket. Yeah, you can advertise the cost. You could, you could charge people to come over to your house.

Oh, that's true. A pair of view fights. You can make sure they don't bring concessions and then you could sell them concessions. Like the leftover Halloween candy, which everyone has. Exactly. This is like a money making enterprise here. Yeah. And and it's right here. I'm totally fine. Is out there trying to help you guys to do it.

Yeah. This is for you. Listen, if at this point, if we haven't sold you, based on all we've been telling you about the film and Natalie's rant being an asshole.

I can rant against the misogynist. You're right. You can't.

You can't do that.

What did he do? You're so curious. I love it. I need to know. I'm edging up on a break.

I don't know if edging is the right way to use this situation, but I'm he's edging. Well, okay. I won't edge you any longer. I will tell you. We were friends.

We were friendly, right? Okay. And then a few years ago, I posted something about, this is this is real talk, serious talk on CBB right now.

Okay, serious talk on CBB.

I'm not being everyone gets here.

For sicious. Do you know about equal pay day, how women get paid less than men? And like, I think equal pay day for white women, I think is in April, meaning they have to, a woman on average has to work a full year and then into April to make the same amount of money that a man makes in one year, right? It's about 75%.

Correct. Right. And then, and then I think for Asian women, it's till like, met, you know, till May and then for black women, it's till June for Latino women, it's in November.

Whoa. Of the following year? Of, of yeah, of the following year. So they have to work a full year into November. And I was, I posted something on Instagram about Latina equal pay day, just informational graphics about that. And he replied, um, it makes you look bad that you're complaining about money. And I went, what? I mean, oh my God. And he went, you're complaining about money.

I'm just letting you know it's making you look bad. And I was like, I'm not complaining about money.

I'm informing people about this. And, and also like how to vote to change that and equality and whatever. And he's like, yeah, but you make more money than I do. And you're complaining about money. And that's what it looks like. And I was like, first of all, you don't know how much money I make second of all, I'm not going to reply to you. I'm just going to keep sending you articles about this until you say you're sorry. And I sent him about 30 articles. And he kept telling me how I was wrong. And then I just blocked him and stopped talking to him. Well, I mean, that grounds to just not like this person. Oh, that's right.

And and thank you. To be honest, you had to direct two movies just to make the money of one movie. I didn't even make the money of one movie. Yeah. Exactly. So this is part of the problem.

Yeah. Yeah. And I, you know, have directed no movies. I've seen your house make labor money.

So did you see my house? I went to a party at your house.

We've all been to your wedding.

We've been to your house. You have great wallpaper. Oh, thank you so much. That's the one thing that we splurched on. It's fantastic. Well, I think that's a that's a fantastic story. I'm glad it pleased you. Does it remain in the episode? I'm not sure.

Wait a minute. Wait, you can't just put the beginning and then not have that part. That part makes it up for everything. Does it? Okay, great. Okay, you think that human eyes is Natalie? Yeah, I need that. Yeah, I need to be humanized.

Natalie is the absolute best. I think that's why that moment made me laugh so hard. Do you guys hang out now since the movie? Yeah. Yeah. So like your buddies now. We're buddies. We've all even buds with it. Like it took doing a film to make us be like to actually make this a real friendship.

Right. Not to be like awkward to hang out. Yeah. It would have felt like a first date otherwise.

Now we're like, we did a film together now we're friends.

Otherwise it was like, I've met that person once. Let's hang out. You know, I know. Sometimes you're in a movie with someone and you're like, God, I cannot stand this. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

We were so into. Oh, yeah. All the time.

Every movie I've ever done picture every person. Yeah. But this is a I mean, look at the chemistry between you two. I mean, you guys, you can hear it. I can see it. I wish this were being filmed.

So people could see it too. But people can see it. If they rent or go to, I'm totally fine, which is in select theaters right now. You can also rent it.

You can get a upon request from your favorite video retailer. Guys, we need to take a break if that's okay. But can you stick around?

We're talking to a YouTube reviewer and a writer. Sure. I don't know. Coming up.

Jillie, I guess. I guess. Okay. We're going to come right back. This is exciting. We have the stars are back on CBB. We have Natalie Morales and Julian Bell will be right back with more comedy back after this. Comedy bang bang. We're back. Natalie Morales, Jillian Bell. I'm totally fine.

Is it look, I know you had a great weekend. I know you're out there, uh, partying your dang asses off. But now it's the weekdays. You can go out there to the theater. The crowds are gone.

You can go check out. I'm totally fine. Also, you know, you can just chill at home and make your TV do all the work, you know? Like why run around just trying to go to this movie?

Like make your TV run around and get it for you. You know, you know, I'm saying, right? Yeah.

We all have. Yeah. That's what that's what a TV is meant to do. Yeah. Your TV goes and collects all the things you watch, right? At night when you sleep. Yeah. I mean, our phones listen to us. So yeah, they do, right? Yeah. Because like, like one day I said, you know, like, hey, there's a shark over there. And then I got a tweet about the movie Jaws. What?

Crazy story, right? If it were true, it's wild. I wish it was true. I wish it was. Oh, God. I wish.

Well, guys, I'm totally fine is out there. And we're going to talk to some other people here.

I don't have high hopes for it though. I talk to other people. Yeah. I mean, they're not in show business, which is like, yeah, well, I waste your time.

Yeah. Although this, this, technically a writer kind of is in show business. And I guess a YouTube reviewer is show business. YouTube as the business now. I think that's true. Yeah. Let's talk to the YouTube reviewer. I don't know what he reviews or where he is on YouTube, but I'll tell you his username.

CJ the man. CJ. No, CJ TE the man 9888 underscore unlimited.

Welcome to the show. Hello, friends and buddies. Welcome. Thank you for having me here. No problem.

Hi, did I get that right? CJ TE the man 988888 underscore unlimited. Yeah, but you can just call me CJ. CJ. Is that your actual name?

The man 9888 underscore unlimited. That's the whole thing.

Yeah, the whole thing.

Yeah, you can call me that. Thank you. Okay. Could I call you anything shorter than that?

Could I call you CJ? Could I call you? I don't want to call you the man. We can cut it off before the unlimited, but I'd appreciate if you kept the underscore otherwise, you know, a little competition, a little confusion in the marketplace. Is there another CJ TE the man 98888? No, but there might be. There might be. Yeah. How did you come across that username? Oh, man, it's like an old inside joke. I don't know. What kind of inside joke has the numbers 98888? Well, it's a couple different jokes. Blended into one. Yeah. Yeah. So what's the CJ part of the joke? Well, I was joking about having CTE and the joke was like, Oh, it's so bad that I forgot what it's called. So I added a J and I don't know that I know what any of that is.

CTE is the it's a you ever see that Will Smith movie, tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth where he was like all about football players getting hit in the head. In that movie, he was upset about people getting hit and then he goes and does the slap her around the world. Well, that's range. You know, that's range as an actor.

You know, please, is it okay if I call you Andy, like really underscore the underscore? Oh, I like that. Yeah, no, that's cool. What's the rest of the joke?

Can we talk about the rest of the joke?

Well, I said it's a couple different jokes. Yeah, you're not all connected. Right. I mean, you don't do the podcast until one joke and then go, that's the joke.

Sometimes it is like, unfortunately. Yeah. But so CJ T. C J T. E. That's one joke.

Right. And it's like funny. It's like, Oh, what if I my brain didn't work? And I said the thing that made my brain not work wrong. Right.

And then the man is there part of that? Is that is that?

Yeah, it's like an old inside joke of like my friends calling me that. Is it spelled T H A? No, oh, that's man. Fuck, I should have done that.

You could register it right now. No, they don't. They're they're weirdly difficult about this stuff.

About changing your name? Yeah. It's not like, you know, the government and shit where you can just like go to a place and be like, well, you have to pay a fee to do it for the privilege.

Sure. Yeah. But like YouTube, I, you know, maybe they don't even let you take, give the money or take the money or, you know, yeah, I'm not interested in this part of the conversation anymore.

Anyway, they call me the man. Because because they thought that was funny to call you the man.

Yeah, because like at the time I was like younger, yeah, right. So I was like a boy or like a team or something. 20. Okay. So you're a man now? Yeah. Yeah.

Now I guess it's like less funny, but it's more throwback to when that was a joke. Right.

Because it's like, I just want to remember where I came from, you know, like it's like important to me that I don't lose sight of where I came from.

Do you forget sometimes? I do a lot. Yeah, that's why they make the joke about me having CTE. And then I make the joke about it. CJTE. Yeah. And it's like the thing I'm trying to remember is that my friends used to call me the man when I was a boy. So you you're a forgetful person. Yeah.

I forgot to breathe. I believe the children are a future.

Yeah, sure. I believe. Give me the rest of the line. The children, the children are our future. I believe the children are our future.

Good. Have you ever heard that song? Or maybe you don't remember? Yeah. I'm not sure. I couldn't say for sure. Or he just forgot. Yeah. Well, that's the next part of the joke is the nine.

98888. Yeah, it's like, oh, I like I can't remember what year I was born. So it's like, what was it like, 1988? But I forgot the one. There's three.

It's all 20. It was the wrong year. So it's like 2002. Yeah, no, it's like really funny that my friends like won't let me live it down that I not only forgot what year I was born in, but I forgot the way that years are structured. Right.

So it's kind of like a double fuck up, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

And Andy, when you say friends, thank you. I'm on these is fitting well. Mostly like my dad.

Okay. Yeah. You're dad and your mom of your friends? Yeah. I got a guy in my bros, you know, who are you? I mean, my brothers. Oh, your brothers. Your actual. Yeah, Jack and Tom. Jack and Tom. And what's your actual name?

CJTE. Oh, you changed your actual name? Yeah, I paid the money. He just talked about the government.

He went to the whole process. Yeah, it's easier to do than on YouTube. Yeah. So what do you review on YouTube? I mean, a great question. Yes. So, you know, like critics, critics are like the first thing that they went without critics are like, you know, people who like tell you like, this is good or this is not good. Right. Okay. So let it be said, comedy bang bang stipulates. We know what God should got you. I didn't know if this show is like for the critics or the fans or whatever, but like critics are like us one for them. Yeah, it's clip face down the middle. Like Natalie Morrell is making the movie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the first half of the episode when I was talking to these two. That was for the fans. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Yeah.

Those habits for. Sorry, though, I was going to explain this. Oh, sure. Critics like they used to like write the thing they were saying, like, you know, like they'd like watch a reader, like do a thing and then they'd write and tell you like, no, go or like go ahead. Yeah, they would be in print form. Right. But that's like not really how it works anymore. Now people like critics do YouTube, you know? So like that's pretty much. So you're talking to camera. You don't have to write it down anymore. You're just going off the top of your head. No, no, no. I review YouTube.

Oh, in general, like the whole site. Yeah, I haven't checked it out yet, but I'm really excited because I've heard good things. Wait, wait, wait.

So I thought this was like a good place to sort of jump into. You haven't checked out YouTube? No, but everyone keeps on telling me that it sounds like fucking crazy. And I was like, so much of a review this. Like if this is as good as people say, then someone needs to tell people to check it out. And if it isn't as good as people say, then someone needs to step up and tell them it actually ain't that hot. Yeah. So have you done a review yet? No, that's once again, I'm coming here to review YouTube for the first time.

Oh, you're reviewing YouTube on here with us. I mean, yeah, I was trying to review on YouTube, reviewing YouTube on CBB. I see. So you're a comedy bing bing reviewer of YouTube. Yes. Well, I'm getting a little confused here.

What do you mean review on YouTube?

I thought you were saying that you were reviewing YouTube on YouTube. Do you know what YouTube is?

No, I'm trying to go in cold. I'm like, okay, but you know, it sounds good. Today, you're going to watch some great. Do you know what something you watch? Let's not. I mean, that's already a little more than I want to know. You know, it's like, what are you going to start?

What are you going to start? Where you put the last line in the trailer? You've seen trailer.

Okay, you've seen trailer. Where do you watch trailers?

Theater's. What do you mean? Oh, movie theaters. Yeah.

We got a lot of movies. Yeah, of course. I love movies.

So are you going to look up something on YouTube right now?

Do you know what to look like? Do you know what to website?

For a second. I downloaded the app. Okay. So that's all I know.

Search bar. And you can type in almost anything.

Well, don't I mean, I'll come up. My whole thing here is I want to do this. Don't tell me what you want to do it right now. Do you want to do it on there?

You're like spoiling for me. You asked what it was. I was telling you. Relax.

I was asking. Look, why are you across the table right in Natalie's face?

A big moment for me. I want this to lean back. Lean back, sir.

This is all because I can only review YouTube one time. And then after that, my opinion is fixed. You know what I'm saying? Oh, wait, you're a you're you're going to be a YouTube reviewer who does one review.

I don't know. Is there another YouTube to review? There are.

There are so many videos. I think it's going to say it to review.

Don't spoil that. He doesn't know there are videos. Sorry.

To review YouTube, it's going to take you your whole life is the thing, right?

To review all of YouTube. Yes. Wait, is it that big?

It's pretty big. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, let's let's load this baby up then.

Yeah, you want to take me that long? We should start right now because I don't know if you've got a hard hour or something. Yeah, no. Yeah, we have a hard out on this interview in about three minutes.

Okay. Wow. Okay. So I got so okay. Hey, this is Hey, friends and buddies. This is CJTE, the man 988 underscore today, also known as Andy eight. And today we're going to be reviewing unlimited underscore on the unlimited extra eight. So today we're going to be reviewing YouTube, which you know, some people are Tommy is really, really great. And some people are saying, is it that great? And I don't know. I haven't been able to answer you because I haven't done it.

So I'm going to try this right now. So right now, I'm just looking at my phone and there's like a little box. CJTE. I don't know that you're going to be able to record yourself while you watch YouTube on the actual phone that you're watching it on. Well, no, you're recording me.

This is the thing right here. Oh, oh, I see. Okay. This is for comedy, baby. You're not recording this on your phone. No, I'm looking to like maybe, you know, get like a new position. Okay.

Okay. So like there's a little box and it's really it's kind of interesting because it's like a little white box and there's an arrow inside another box inside that box. So it's like a white box and there's a red box and inside the red box is like a little is a little white arrow. So it's it's pretty cool. And there's anything like this before.

And are you just are you just reviewing the icon? The logo. Well, I have taken one step at a time. So now I'm looking here and wow, this is this is wild actually. It's set. So it says YouTube on the top and then we got, you know, our old friend the little arrow inside the box. And then there's some other buttons here and it's pretty wild. I haven't actually seen something like this before. Yeah. So lots of stuff. You need to be on our Wi-Fi. I feel like in order for something to come up in this room. Okay. Yeah. Do you know how to get on Wi-Fi? Wi-Fi is yeah. Of course, I know what Wi-Fi is.

Yeah. I use the Wash Hulu. So this is like we're here. Okay. So YouTube is a little like Hulu. I have to say, well, don't tell me sorry.

Sorry. I know. No spoilers. So it's handmade still on here.

What's on it? Is handmade still on YouTube?

I'm sure some version of it. I bet there's some ribs recording.

Yeah. Some trailers. Some trailers. That's their thing, man.

Are you a lawyer?

No, maybe I should be. If no one thought about that before, that's like if I were Hulu, I'd be like, don't, don't. YouTube, I have to say, is so sprawling.

It's very hard to control. You know, you can, you can put up season to season. I mean, you're saying it's sprawling, but right now I got blank screen. I'm seeing nothing. You need to be able to Wi-Fi. Wow. There really is nothing.

There's not, it's really kind of, because right now I'm like questioning, because when people tell me this is good, I'm like looking at it now and there's like nothing on here.

It's because you can't get a signal. Okay. Well, so then I got to bring that into the review.

Here's the thing. People say YouTube is great, but I got to call out. I got to be a little critical here. The signal doesn't work. And so that for me is a problem. I'm going to hold that again.

A deal breaker. So if you're trying to use YouTube, definitely work on that signal.

Okay. Yeah. I worry that unless you get on our Wi-Fi, there's going to be nothing and no content.

So there's a trending button at the bottom. It's got a little fire and I press on it and it says error loading, tap to retry. Now, I don't think this is a great interface. Like if I'm comparing this against the other apps that I've done, I don't love this, but there's another thing here that says subscriptions. I don't know, maybe like a magazine or something, but this also says error loading, tap to retry. So far, definitely I find YouTube a little repetitive because they're kind of hitting the same beat a couple times. And now there's another button. It says library. It looks like, you know, honestly, it kind of looks like the subscriptions button where it's like pages with different arrows on the man. This site's crazy for arrows.

But so I'm pressing the library button and man error load and tap to retry. Don't you hate when that happens? Yeah. Scott, is this the kind of correspondent you were looking for for the show? I'm not sure this is going to be a regular feature on the show. Semi regular? Irregular maybe? Okay.

Yeah, that's cool, man. I see why they call you the king of jokes. Okay, so there's also like a magnifying glass, which is pretty wild because it feels like Sherlock Holmes. Yeah, right. Like I love that guy. He's crazy. He fucking boxes and shit. And it's like if YouTube had some of that, I would love a lot of boxing. Oh, fucking man, cool. But he's a signal. But is it like Sherlock boxing?

Because I like that he boxes, but he's also smart. And it's like, you hear his monologue as he's doing it. Yeah, he's good at boxing because he's his fists are tough and shit. But also it's because he thinks so fucking fast. He's like punching them with his mind. You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

Anyway, I feel like you're probably five stars right now. Really. Thank you, man. That means a lot to me. Why? Why did your family suggest YouTube to you as something that that you would enjoy? They were just like, I don't know, man, shut up. Just watch YouTube or something. And I was like, huh, interesting. So you you live at home.

Yeah. Yeah. And you big time. Yeah. You you don't have a job it seems like? Well, I mean, you're hoping this will be a job. Yeah. I'm not going to say I mean, I don't know that I'm going to be paying you necessarily to do this. But not you like the company or whatever. Right? I mean, I am the company. That's good. You're the company? Yeah. Oh, man, that rules. How do you do that?

Because I've been thinking like, I should do that. Like when I look at companies, I'm like, that fuck, that's the thing I should be doing. And that's honestly, if I'm being honest with you, that's sort of like the whole thought with the YouTube reviewing thing. Yeah. It's being like, no, this is doing this. I can do this. And then that's a company. I guarantee no one else is reviewing YouTube. That's what I'm saying as a platform. As a platform. I think there are a lot of people reviewing certain videos. Sure. But no one's, I've not heard of a single person who's going on podcasts to review all of the right. You bring up some salient points. I mean, there are a lot of arrows on this thing. And no one talks about that. Like, because every all of my friends are committing this to me, they were never like, watch out for arrows.

Yeah. No, that's true. If I were recommending YouTube to someone, I'd be like, don't let the fact that there are three arrows and just think and views you. I know. I know. And some of them are red. And some of them are just like outline. Excited by the little fire.

Yeah. The fire was cool. Let's go back to that. So like here's, because it says, what is this?

It's just trending, right? Yeah. And like that sounds cool.

Like these are not going to be lame.

You know, whatever it is. I still can't see what it is.

Because it's the error loading tap to try. Got me honest, at this point, YouTube feels a little like an escape room. Like, I haven't solved the puzzle of how to get out of this error loading. I feel like I'm on the Wi-Fi here. So I can, if you, okay. Well, first, the first thing that pops up is there's some, some women skating roller skating. So it says, it says new looks still YouTube. We've refreshed our vibe and it looks even better in dark theme. Try it out.

Now this is the first thing you've ever seen on YouTube for me, because I really don't have a frame of reference. Well, here's the problem. Yeah. Like normally you go on YouTube and you see a video of something you're interested in.

Sure. The very first thing you have ever seen on YouTube is this confusing thing of two women skating and it says new looks still. Yeah. It's very confusing. And also I'm getting a little worried.

I might have missed like my window of opportunity, because I'm like, if this is a new look, then like, oh, man, I didn't even get around to get old. Yeah, any of the older ones. But okay, I'm going to set it to, I'm going to set it to dark. All right. Yeah. Set the, oh my god.

Even more instructions. Wow. Zoom in, let go. Pinch to zoom in full screen, then let go and watch the video in more detail. I mean, once again, I don't really get what everyone's talking about here. This so far does not see. By the way, you're losing Natalie and Julie fun. Yeah, they're scooting towards each other. They've gone off my writing. Now they're having a death. Now they're having a conversation with notes. This is not see. This is the thing.

Yeah. I'm so sorry to interrupt. We both wrote on the table that we love you.

Yes. Not you, but it's not you. But you, not you on either.

Who's the you in question? Whoever reads it next. Yeah. So we both put that. Yeah. That's pretty cool. I'm so sorry. Yeah. You did, you did bore me a bit. Okay. Well, I was boring. Yeah. Maybe that's the point here is like people say YouTube is exciting, but honestly, I find it kind of boring.

It's telling me a lot of shit to do like a class. And I was told this was gonna be fun. Hey, in the immortal words of Jay Leno, he's something. Oh, man. I love him. He's got fucking cars in the world. First, first thing that pops up for me. Yeah. Wet leg. Oh, full performance. I love wet leg.

Live on K. It's a great band. You would love them. You probably like them unless you don't like music. Is it a song called what dream? That's my favorite song. No, it's a song called live performance live on K.E. X P K. Exp 100 96 K views one month ago. Oh, I love that song. But here's the thing. If you were to press on that, then this band Wetleg.

Yeah. If you would see, I think, a full three camera in the style pioneered by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Okay.

What do you see? Desi three camera shoot. The Desi Lou company. Do you know that J.

You know that Hoover fucking loved that shit? What? J.

Edgar Hoover like pulled in himself.

Tyler, how do you know? Yeah. I watch the documentary being the Ricardo's and at the end, J. Edgar Hoover is like, I like Lucy. And that's why they call the show. Well, that's why though, because the public was like, if he loves it, because everyone thought he like fucking calm me.

And then he called in and he was like, I like her and the public was like, maybe we love CJTE.

That wasn't Hulu movie. Yeah. CJTE, the man, 9888.

Underscore. Sorry. Thank you. Underscore. What's after that?

You said I could stop at the underscore unlimited. Yeah. Undy. Yeah. Look, undy. Yeah.

You know, you seem to know a little, I mean, you know a lot about you've seen a lot of movies. I love movies, man. Man, I wish you those on YouTube. What do you mean? Like YouTube, anyone can put a video of themselves doing anything up on YouTube. And you know, when you were saying like this many views, that's how many people watched this particular thing that is on YouTube. One month of people watched that. Watch that many things. Yeah, that many views. You should just, I mean, what's the last movie you saw?

Last movie I saw. Not yet. Okay. Did you see barbarian?

Yeah. Okay. Talk about barbarian.

What do you think about barbarian? I'll film you. I'll film you. I'll film you.

No, don't. No, but I think this is one of those movies where what's really cool is that you have no idea what's going to happen. This could be your hook, by the way. You're the guy who talks about the ends of movies. The thing, this move, you never see it coming. Right? The spoiler reviewer.

Yes. Okay. So talk about the end of our barrier. So fucked up. It's like, oh, man, like I was sitting there and I was like, leap all of this. No, like you can't do that. And it wasn't just not doing it. It's like the last like, ow, you can't keep on showing you. I stopped filming.

We stopped filming. I stopped filming. This is not going to be good. So I should.

You should. Just spend more time with your parents. Yeah.

Are they independently wealthy?

Yeah. But they're like, go do the YouTube like they're really trying to push. They're really pushing it. Yeah. Well, you know what's be alone in your room. Do some more research.

Fuck man. That's interesting. Yeah. Just hang out in your room by yourself.

Yeah. I should hang out in my room by myself and do my own research. Yeah. Do your own research.

Fuck. Exactly. Yeah. Cause I hate people. And then turn on you shit. And I'm like, I can fucking do my own research. Turn on your own. Turn on your guy alone in a bedroom with the internet. Turn on YouTube. Yeah. Type in the word vaccines.

Do your own research. Fuck.

Cause I think those things are weird and no one talks about this. No, no, this is.

I'm not like, but it's like what in my arm? I think this is better for you than being a reviewer on this. I think I wouldn't heard one. I would rather create an incel than have you review things on my show anymore. So I think this is good for you. Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. All right. Good. Well, stick around. Oh, I was not going to ask.

I was actually going to ask you to leave, but you can stick around. Yeah, I can. Thank you, man. Well, we have a writer coming up.

Don't know what they write. But yeah, I thought about doing that. Okay, we'll be right back. We have more from Natalie Morales, more from Jillian Bell. We have more, unfortunately, from CJTE, the man 98888, underscore unlimited. We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this comedy bang bang. We're back. We have Natalie Morales, Jillian Bell. The movie is, I'm totally fine. And what is the last line of the movie?

You say it's not, I'm totally fine, doubt style. So I don't think I can say what the last line of the movie is. Is it goodbye, alien?

I go tada. That's how you say goodbye to an alien in their leg. Yes.

Tada. Tada. Tada. Okay, good to know. I think you say, is it, yeah, I guess it's a spoiler to say the last one. Yeah, it's a spoiler. Yeah. Interesting.

Man, I want to hear what this last. Tell me, tell me, tell me, do you watch the movie, Ocker Man? All right. You're watching a home when you're up at like three AM, not knowing what to do. I mean, to be fair, have I watched four hours of bachelor in paradise this week? Yes.

I probably could have fitted in.

We also have CJTE, the man 98888, the women and buddies.

Sorry, underscore. Yeah, thank you.

You could call me Andy. Andy is here. Let's get to our next guest. They're a writer. This is very exciting because I've picked up a typewriter or a word processing unit once or twice in my career.

So I'm interested to talk to them about the craft, not the movie, of course. That's Scott hasn't named that movies fucking crazy. They're like, what happens to the end? They like, God, they're so much. All right. I'm cutting you off. All right.

Let's please welcome them. Please welcome Piper Audoggy.

Hey, Scott, thanks so much for having me.

Hey, Piper, so nice to meet you. This is Jillian. This is Natalie.

Hi, I'm the honor to meet you guys. Is this a really special?

Is that what you said?

Truly honored. Can I ask, is your last name a doggy or are you a doggy?

No, it's just my name and it's actually a pen name. Oh, it's my real name. It's my pen name.

And I've always convinced to have a pen name because I feel like if your work is even remotely autobiographical, you should probably have a pen name so people can't pin you for your right. I see. Okay. So that's just your right. So your work is autobiographical?

Very, very, very, very loosely autobiographical.

Okay. And we're keeping your real identity a secret so no one knows exactly who you're talking to. Unlike Natalie, we're talking about this guy. Sure.

Yeah. No, I think it's important to keep in with any way or anything. I'm pretty sure the people who are listening to the show will pinpoint who this guy is within like the first five minutes. The show is really.

They're going to have some of my problems. I'm trying to find that out for sure. Yeah.

So Piper, a doggy. What type of thing do you write?

I write really awesome holiday movie scripts. Holiday movie scripts.

Oh, I love holiday movies. I heard one time that those sell better than other movies.

So those here, all of mine are just right in that holiday movie genre.

Awesome. The holidays are coming. Do you guys watch holiday movies? Sure.

Yeah. Any particular, do you mean only Christmas? Would you say holiday or is it any holiday?

Christmas, Christmas movies, but I'm open to any holiday, to be honest.

Yeah. Yeah. Is it primarily Christmas? Primarily Christmas, but I can definitely work on that if that's something that people need from their scripts. I can probably change it a little bit.

Are you getting nervous? No, I'm not nervous. I'm just really excited to be here.

We're just asking questions. Super, super, super excited and honored because I know you have a big reach. And so I'm hoping to maybe, you know, get someone to sort of, you know, get, have an interest in one of the scripts in that picture. You don't have to be nervous. I can hear the quavering in your voice. I got a question. Do you ever try writing Valentine's Day?

That's a movie already. I know, but it's like it'd be smart to write it because that movie fucking rips and you watch it and you're like, what are you like about Valentine's Day? Yeah, Ash and Guzher. You know, I'm saying like you should write that again because it fucking worked less. Valentine's Day reboot? Yeah. For sure. I mean, I just, I just try to keep, I just try to write things that I know. If that makes sense, I still, yeah, do you not know Valentine's Day?

I don't, I haven't had much experience with like a Valentine's Day.

But um, but I do like the day, you know, I like chocolate and flour and all that kind of stuff.

Well, you know, you're not allowed to eat chocolate or smell flowers if they haven't been given to you.

That's true. It's bad luck. Yeah. Boy, I wonder if that has something to do with it then.

Tell us about the scripts you have written. Okay. So I've got a couple that I would love to just throw out there and if someone's interested, then you know, you can. These are all unsold.

These are unsold as of this moment, but I know there's going to be a lot of it. So as of us recording this, but who knows by the time it airs, he's good. I'll be picked to have an I could be a a Scott. You should grab like a like an auction gavel or something because I think there might be a bidding war. Okay. Are you, are you trying to get a catchphrase going? Yeah, I felt like that segment really didn't work and I need to find the new role in the show if I'm going to stick her. Okay. So you're the guy pitching. Yeah. Catch raises or maybe. Okay. Good. All right.

You felt it didn't work? No. Well, yeah. Kind of. Okay. We'll talk about it.

During the break. Hey, Piper, if we like one of your movies, can we attach to it? Oh my god.

I would be absolutely honored. I can't even tell you how that much that would mean to me.

I can tell you about one of them right now. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Please. Because either of you would be perfect for this role. Oh, that's okay. Oh, there's only one role. You have to fight over it.

Well, I've got a lot of scripts though. So you guys could each do half of my script. All right.

Give us one that you think would be good for us. Now is the director too. And Jillian, I don't know if you have aspirations to maybe Natalie could direct Jillian in the movie. Oh, that would be great. This is perfect. Let's hear it both right now. Okay. Here we go. Well, then there'd be a power imbalance between the two of you. I don't know. Anyway, go ahead. Okay. So this is the title of this movie is the girl who hooked up with her high school crush on a holiday cruise.

Wow. I love it already. Thank you so much. Okay. So I'm going to tell you how it starts.

So it starts with a girl who's not very popular in high school. And she's like not generally respected or supported by her peers really at all, which is actually how most good movies start.

So she moves to Hollywood big time Hollywood California and she starts writing scripts because she's going to make it big. And so she's having a really ton of success. Lots of accolades and a lot of recognition in Hollywood California. Like the Egot or yeah, she's prepping for an Egot.

Prepping for. Oh, yeah. We all are in our own way. So, um, so all of her trials and tribulations in high school really prepare for perfectly for the rejection she experiences in Hollywood. So she's doing good. She's earning confidence. And, um, and then after a couple of years, she looks on Facebook and she sees her high school crush, Calvin Ward.

And he is going on a cruise during the holidays. He mentions this. He mentions this on Facebook. Uh huh. He's like, Hey, if anyone else is going on a cruise, he just says he's doing it. So she books a ticket for the very same cruise.

Can I ask a quick question though? Yeah. Since this is on Facebook, is she 60 or 70? Like, how? Oh, no, she's 28. Okay. She's 28 years here. This is part of meta. Yeah. Yeah. It's right. So she, um, no legs is problem. And so she, um, so you know about that? Yeah, of course.

It's just not YouTube. So she, um, so she packs like only her most glamorous, but not too revealing one piece bathing suits. And she's on the cruise and she sees Calvin and he sees her. And she pretends at first not to recognize him because she's angry at him, but he recognizes her right away and he comes up to her and he says, I always had a crush on YouTube a whole entire time.

And she, and then she says, why are you so mean to me? And he says, because I was suffering verbal abuse from my father. And she, and she takes him to the, oh, you can eat lobster buffet dinner.

And she fixes all of his trauma and he proposes and they get married on the cruise. Yeah. How long is the cruise? Four days. I mean, love it. It's a ticking clock. I love it. Do you want to do it? Listen, I need to, okay. You're 28 in it, right? Yeah.

I get to be 28 in it. Yeah. I'll be in it.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew that would be so. Yeah. Yeah.

She's trying to keep her rolls young.

Yeah. You don't want to play the moms just yet. I have. And when I was pretty young, I was like, wow, they're really seeing me in this role. I was like 22 and I had an 18 year old going to college.

It's like being a milk porn star. It's like, well, I don't know. Is it like, yeah, but they're all, they're all 22. How's it? Oh, I see.

Okay. Oh, it's just, they look like I'm a milk. Yeah. Okay. It's just they look like they've had a heart. You should review porn. Yeah.

Do you like porn? Yeah. Have you seen any? No, but I heard a lot of great things. My boys just never seen it. It's like, you know, I always keep telling you that's your brothers.

Your actual. Yeah. My bros and the shit they do, it sounds so crazy. Like, I don't even know how you like think. No matter what you're into, you'll. Yeah.

There must be a porn reviewer out there.

Well, don't say that too loudly because I think he just stepped up to the plate. I know.

No. All right. Don't give anyone else any ideas. Okay.

Piper, this is a really interesting script. What's it called again? The girl that hooked up with her high school crush on a holiday career. Yeah. And this is, you said it's sort of auto biographical.

I just loosely, loosely, very loosely. I'm not connected to my life in any way at all. Yeah. Do you know someone named?

What was the Calvin? Oh, Calvin word. That's interesting.

Do you know a Calvin word?

It's so interesting. Now you see that I did remember someone with names like that in high school. Is it like it or is it Calvin word? I think actually it was Calvin word. That's wild.

It's wild. I never thought about it. And you guys just spread it up just now. It's interesting.

It's interesting how they created a process. How we think of names for the.

No, it's because you know, you just let it flow through.

You waste what I've heard.

Yeah. So that's about what happened. You just made like a diarrhea, mining motion.

Oh, right through you. Right out the other. Should we get Calvin on the phone? Yeah.

Should we call Calvin? Yeah. Let's call Calvin. Let's do what's Calvin. Maybe we could find him on Facebook. I think we could find him on Facebook. I've never seen him on Facebook.

But I'm sure I bet. Okay. It would be surprising. Maybe doing it. Yeah. But you're using a pseudonym.

So yeah. Yeah. So you would know who I am. That's right.

Yeah. Okay.

Your first name is Piper or. That's my that's my pen name.

Oh, oh, so the odd doggies.

That's also my pen name. Okay. It's changed both of them.

Can I change my whole name to Piper or doggy?

And do you recognize your voice from high school? So I can't imagine why you would.

I found a Calvin Ward. Sounds like a lot of people. I found a Calvin Ward from Piedmont.

Is that where you're from? Oh, boy. Yeah. That is where I'm from. Yeah. Okay.

Yeah. It looks like he has open relationship. No, he's not in an open relationship, but he's able to. I'm sorry to hear that. He's able to take phone calls. It looks like from the baseball. Here we go. All right. It's ringing. It's ringing.

Hello. Hi, Calvin.

Kevin Ward. Hi, who's calling? Hi, this is Scott Ockerman of Comedy Bang Bang.

I see 110 episodes. Sorry about the cancellation. It was more of a mutual decision.

Anyway, hey, Calvin, so nice to. So nice. That's not me panting, by the way.

Do you have a doggy in the studio? A doggy? Who calls it a doggy?

I don't know. Like that little animal that pants. No, I know what a doggy is, but are you 12?

I don't think it's weird for me to call it a doggy. Okay.

Anyway, I, have I won something? No, other than the opportunity to talk to someone who you may remember from high school. Her pen name is Piper a doggy. Wait a second. I'm sorry. You stopped me and questioned me saying a doggy. And now you're telling me that you do in fact have a doggy in the studio. Okay.

You mocked me. Okay. Look, yes. I'm a fan. You're out, really? Yes. I said I was sorry to hear about the cancellation. I mean, that was seven years ago.

Calvin, you digress and there's a more important thing happening. There's a woman who knows you from high school. Okay, is there a woman in the studio or a doggy in the studio? You have to be clear with your words. That sounds crowded.

It's a tight fit. It's a tight squeeze. Any guess? Any guess? Any guess on the episode? I usually have like celebrities. Yeah, we have.

And this is Natalie Morales. Oh, hello.

Yeah, I thought you said yes. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry. My condolences on Abby and Idiot sitter. Abby's. Oh, thank you. Well, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. You know, when you're just meeting someone for the first time, don't bring up their failed. Yeah. I love, I'm sorry that it had, I wasn't rooting for the failure. I wish we were still living in an era.

Yeah. No, he said a crisis on you. Oh.

I'm sorry. I don't think I know a Calvin a doggy. Is there another name you want? Your name is. This is Piper. Your Calvin.

Well, then I definitely don't know. Did you play football?

Did you have a head injury? Yeah, I got a little bit of CJT. What did you say your name is?

I don't know if my actual name, but I don't have a pen name is Piper. And I just, you know, we went to, I told the guy, I was going to say a question on you. I mean, there's no way you don't recognize that voice. I don't know. There's not a lot of people I went to high school with.

Oh, really? Oh, well, she is kind of a regional.

Piper is a very successful Hollywood. I mean, she lives in Hollywood, California, we're going to come here right now, but I've got a lot of ask for agent.

Yeah, she's a she's on her way to an ego. And also, she's she just sold me a movie.

Yeah. And I'm attached. And I've got a lot more pictures that I can sell to you right now.

Can you tell us another one? Sure. I'd love to. The next, the next script that I have is called a girl, the girl who finally quit her barista job on Christmas. Yeah. Okay. I also have the girl who convinced Charlie and Lauren to make her lease month to month. Oh, one new year's eve.

Oh, one new year's eve. Okay. I mean, the rent would be due the next day.

Well, she was not very popular in high school and she was sort of stuck into a multi year, really, just devastatingly. Those two facts relate.

Just the lack of confidence when signing a lease made you sign a bad lease.

Yeah. Yeah. Actually, well, in the script, what's really interesting is her landline ended being her high school crush. Oh, what's his name? Calvin Ward.

That's your name, Calvin. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Calvin, were you were you popular in high school?

Yeah, very. Yeah. Yeah. What do how are you so popular? I was voted most likely to become a landlord.

Oh, are you a landlord these days? I am. Yeah. Yeah. How many properties do you own?

One. Okay. How many tenants? One. Oh, I mean, that's not nothing. No, it's not not too there as well. No, it's a little place I have in Hollywood.

Oh, just she just convinced you to go month to month or has that not happened yet?

It's an ongoing conversation. I guess it is only November, right? Calvin, congratulations on your property. Thank you. So you wait, you have a property in Hollywood? Yeah. Yeah. Who's your tenant?

It's like a writer or something. Oh, what's do you know her name? She must be signing the checks all the time. Yeah. Tiffany Blastard. Tiffany Blastard?

Is that your name, Tiffany? Hi, Tiffany Blastard. That sounds like a popular girl name to me.

I thought it was too, but I didn't work out for me. Yeah, the Blastard part. The Blastard really ruined Tiffany. Blastard is rough. Yeah, Tiffany sounds like a hot girl, but Blastard just screws the whole thing over. Yeah. And you can't just change it just to Tiffany because there already was one. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Tiffany, so you moved into Calvin's building? I didn't know what we said. I moved in. It was just chance. This is like a movie.

You should be a writer. I am a writer.

I've been a writer for a long time. I've been a decade here in Hollywood trying to make it.

A decade. That's too long to have no success. Yeah, I know.

I'm like, I'm like, here I am. And I just stole the script. You live in person. She did. Calvin, what's your answer here? We, uh, if you want to go on a date, we'll pay for it. Oh, yeah. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. Fuck. And it makes the show. What do you mean it makes the show? Wait, what?

No, I'm saying like, well, that like, will that get on the show? You're on the show, my man.

I know. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just kind of looking for like a recurring segment or something. So I feel like, well, you and, uh, CJC, he's a real opportunist. Hey, where did, where did CJT, the man, hey, hey, hey, hey, this is absolutely one of the wildest things I ever heard happen. You just put your phone back in your pocket, CJT. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Cause YouTube ain't working for shit. It's still just fucking arrows. Oh, okay. Anyway, go back to whatever you're doing. I'm going to review this. Yeah. So like, shit, this, it's like so crazy. She like, right, right? Yeah.

Okay. She writes, I can't deal with you. I can't deal with you. See, this is why I'm saying, if this guy gets a segment, why can't I have like a? Yeah.

Uh, well, do you want to go on this date?

I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind it. I mean, I don't have to be on a holiday. No, it could be any time. I just, I wouldn't request, um, that, that, uh, Calvin treat me better than he did in high school. What do you say, Calvin? Is that possible? I would love to, if possible, sort of maybe tie this negotiation into the new lease. Yeah. What are some of the things I'm sort of, what are some of the things he did to you in high school? So he knows what not to do. Yeah. I mean, there was a time when I was walking into hallway and had my butterfly clips in and he, um, he just poured milk all over my head. The butterfly clips are important. Yeah.

Because I remember it so well, you know, you remember what you were wearing on really significant days. Yeah. Yeah. I also stuff my bra that day and it was so and it was soaked right? The stuff. It was so all of those butterfly clips that were probably okay. Yeah. Those were fine. Cause those are plastic. Yeah.

If you stuff your bra with a lot of like toilet paper and then someone pours milk on you, they had like really soggy bra soggy. Yeah. You should buy some of those like silicone cups kind of.

Oh, yeah. I should have done that. The milk. The poor, the poor news. All the milks, all the mils use this. And there are porn's I think where milk comes out of some of those.

He thinks. Yeah. Wait a minute. From what I told you, how do you know? My reporters watched that on the porn review correspondence of told. Hey, no spoilers, man. I don't want to fucking hear any of this until I watch it. Well, listen, there's no holidays between here and Thanksgiving.

We discovered, we discovered that earlier. Yeah. I figured that out. I was racking my brain for one. So my birthday. Oh, my birthday is November 14th. Oh, you want to go out on November 14th and it's a Monday. There's not much going on. I feel like you probably don't have anything yet.

Can I suggest a movie? It's actually a Sunday, but oh, I like this. You can watch a movie on the day. Yeah. Oh, you're right. It's a Monday. But I like, I hate going out to the theaters.

I want to go back. Can you watch the fuck up and just go this fucking day, Calvin? You watch it at home. Well, that's the answer. We'll just get both of them horny. No. Well, but it depends on what gets you horny, but it's dark. Grief get you horny.

Milk mostly, I would say. Milk? Great.

Yeah. Oh, wait. So you were horny that day when you poured milk on her? Oh, this is insane. I know it.

Are you at home? Tiffany, you did have a crush on me. It was out of love and desire. I think I've been leasing my apartment to you for 10 years. Tiffany, you deserve whatever this is. You do.

It's out of slam or? I don't know. It's the truth. None of us know what this crazy thing is, right? We're too deep in it. We've got to ride it out, I guess. Hey, man, you're in Hollywood.

Won't you get out here to the studio? Hang up the phone.

Like, how far away are you from the studio?

You see that big building with the with the big E? Yeah.

Yeah, the ear-roll studios.

You know, you know the office where they record a three of them? Yeah, that's right. It pressed the hall. Oh, why are you? Why are you in there? I don't know.

I was trying to get booked.

We'll get in here. Get in here, buddy. Okay, so we're gonna.

Oh, God, he's here. Hey, hey.

Okay, Calvin, Tiffany. Have we made a love connection here?

He's very sweaty right now.

I don't know how you have so much sweat from just running across the hall. I saw it. Incline.

There's an incline in the hallway. In the hallway. Why is there an incline? Oh, no, man. I didn't build this place. Yeah. All right, so are you still in to him?

Having seen him here? Oh, no. I remember him looking a little fresher. Yeah, you know, sweaty now.

Do you want to take a shower?

Do you have showers? Yeah, we have shower in the corner over there. If you just pull the cart curtain, you go ahead and use the shower. Okay, use the shower. Okay. Yeah.

It feels a little unconventional, but it's okay. We're all waiting, Calvin. Yeah, take the shower, if you don't mind. Okay, just can you guys like, we're waiting. Okay, take the shower. Okay.

You guys, I can tell you right now. I'm actually not a drag to do it anymore. Great. I think that's so good for you. I think you should just let him go. Yeah, there's so many great people in Hollywood.

Yeah, I don't feel like I need him anymore. Are you okay if I make a move? Absolutely.

I like this. I mean, showering. I mean, I won't support it, but I do respect you. So go ahead.

Well, we've got our premiere tonight. I need to date. Oh, okay. You done, Calvin? Yeah, I am drawing. All right. Oh, some interesting developments. Okay, let me just tell a little quick. Oh, I just saw his dick. I'm out. Oh, okay. I'm out too big, too small. No, I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it. Too wide? I feel like it smiled at me and I don't know how to explain it in another room. It's anthropomorphic.

Yeah. Okay. All right. Some interesting things have happened. Okay. Take a mission. You fill me in. I was kind of first volume zone there. You smell great. Thank you. Yeah, sensational. Yeah. That's my own brand of body wash. Incredible. Yeah. Scott's fresh. Yeah, exactly.

It's some secret ingredients. Seven herbs and spices. But some interesting things have happened.

First of all, Tiffany over here has decided she is not attracted to you anymore. It's nothing personal. I just don't like the way you look in person. Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I get that. I get that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then Jillian was into you for a half sec. Oh, yeah. It was fun. She was in and out. Yeah.

Saw your dick and decided that she's out. Yeah, that tracks real bad dick. Yeah. Real bad dick.

Real bad. Yeah. I've remained the same and not into you the whole time. Yeah. Well, I'm consistent.

I have to respect that. Honestly, in this day and age, someone who can really stick to their guns, I respect that. Yeah. Scott, do you want to give this a shot or? Oh, oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

I was a guy named Andy here. Who maybe? Andy? Oh, maybe.

Yeah. You guys are on his phone in the corner again. And you have very similar voices. You really do. I don't know, man. I feel like there's some differences. Maybe a minor minor difference. I feel like you're hyping up your voice right now to try to sound different. I think it's pretty much always sounded like this. I don't know that you've even sounded this. Okay. Anyway, yeah. If you guys want to get together and go out tonight, review his dick. That's interesting. I don't think I said that. No, but like no, everyone's talking about this dick. Yeah. No one knows what to make of it. I think Jillian knows what to make of it, if not what to do with it. I don't know what to do with it. I don't know what anyone does with it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let me give this a shot. Okay. We've made a love connection.

Wonderful. Calvin, would you mind just telling off again quickly? Sure thing. Okay. Wow. Okay.

So you do have similar voices. Yeah. No, I think this is like pretty different. And I'm looking at this dick now. And it's, you know, it's, it's actually, because it's like not who boy. It's it.

With the best word for it be interesting. Yeah. Really?

Like, but like really though, because it's like of interest. We all know dicks, right?

Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone.

Right. Not sure. Yeah. And like this one is like, it's like, it's not the, it's not the same.

Yeah. Right. It's not, it's not like yours. No. Yeah. Not at all. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

It's almost like it's like smiling at me. Yeah. Yeah. That's the only way I could describe it.

Yeah. Like the new Paramount Pictures film. Smile. Yeah.

Coming in on a 100 mil domestic real word mouth. You know a lot about movies. I love them. I wish I could turn it into a career.

And you just, or you can't talk about films without just, just resorting to, you know, platitudes of it. It's so good. Okay. Anyway. All right.

One like this dick, which I'd say, probably six out of 10. That's a pretty good. Yeah. If I hear a six out of 10. I think they're going to make it. Yeah. I mean, it's on your date tonight, guys. Have fun, guys. Yeah.

We're sending you to a wonderful movie. I'm totally fine.

Yes. It's going to get you nice and horny if you're into the things happening on screen, like grief and milk and smiling dicks. Yeah. Everything. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Wonderful. I'm so glad we made a match here. Finally. I've got to be trying to set people up on this show for weeks now, years actually. This is the first time it's ever worked. Oh wait. Like what about a doggy, man?

Oh, she came here looking for love? No, I didn't come looking for love. I'm looking, I came looking to sell a script and I did it. Yeah. Right out of the gate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And very, very hot, awesome ladies. And they're going to, one's going to drag, and one's going to start it. And with you guys attached, quite honestly, I have a first look deal where pretty much anything under 25 mill, you can make, I can, yeah, get greenlit. So I'm ready to greenlight this, was you guys attached. You know, I have a regular weekly segment on comedy bang bang where I reviewed dicks. We know, no, no, no, unfortunately, I agree.

I would, Scott, full motion of hail.

Yours is the only storyline. Not getting closer. Like closures happen. No, unfortunately, it's not. Yeah. It's again Valentine's day. I'm so sorry.

We are running out of time though.

Unfortunately, we only have time for one final feature on the show. That is a little something called plugs. Man is born. Man lives. Man plugs. And it's all vanity. Man is born. Man lives. Man plugs.

And it's all vanity. He tried plugs.

He said I gave my plugs to enjoy pleasure. What are teenagers doing today?

They're trying every thriller is in the plugs. Hey, all right. I like that. That was plug thrills by Wyatt Cblom. Wyatt Cblom. Thank you so much to Wyatt.

Guys, what are we plugging?

Natalie and Jillian, obviously I'm totally fine as in theaters and upon request at your own home, right? Correct. That's great. Yes. Any other plugs? You know, I mean, look, this is your time to shine.

I mean, this is the favorite. Everyone's favorite feature on the show is the plugs.

Is it? Yeah. So, I mean, like, plug them if you got them quite honestly.

I would say that we're also in a movie with Blake Anderson.

Really? And now it's called, I'm totally fine. Yeah. Oh, that's a good plug. Kyle Newichak.

And Natalie and I did a movie as well called I'm totally fine. Okay. That's coming out. Yeah.

That's a lot of stuff. You guys have a lot on your plate. Yep. Yeah. That's great. All available right now. Yeah. All of them are of it really simultaneous release. Yeah. Yeah. We're just hoping you know, I like to do it simultaneously.

That's how I do it. That's how she do it. Wow. Okay. CJTE, the man 9888, 888 underscore unlimited. What do you want to plug? Oh man.

Like where to even begin?

You know, as I said, I love movies and I wish I could like talk about them for a living, but these other guys got to it first. So I can't. But I want a lot of movie podcast. No, even I have one.

I would believe it if I saw it. But Blank Check is like two guys and they talk about movies and they're really concise. They're able to like knock out an 80 minute movie in like three, three and a half hours. Real tight episodes. No fat. I remember I did that show once and I had took us to a Broadway show. Yeah, you didn't make it. Three hours after it started. And I was like, certainly I'll be able to make this. And I had to cut off the show and say I'm leaving right now.

Yeah, no, it's really nice and short. Yeah. But like great and really. What are they covering right now? Oh man. How do I even describe it? It's so loud.

Stanley Kubrick. Oh yeah. If you see it like 2001, a space odyssey. What do we think about Dr.

Srange love? Not funny, right? So funny.

This guy in this, but it's like a little it's like actually a little scary. It's good movie.

It looks seer. And it's good movie. It's not a comedy, right? Yeah. But but it but I mean, it's going to be it's trying to be a comedy. Right. Yeah.

Yeah. Excuse me, Scott. Can I can I play something as well? Yeah, Calvin, sure. Yeah. I'm very excited for a Disney plus original film coming out called Disney Chanton. Oh, yeah, that's the sequel to the channel. Yeah, with Amy Adams and James Marsden. Yeah, exactly. And that Calvin? No, I'm not. There's a I saw the trailer, though, and there's like a funny animated chipmunk who has a voice that's very different than mine or CJ TE the man's. He's got like a very distinct voice.

What does it sound like if you good, imitate it? I saw him like this. So exactly like your voice in the I think it was pretty different.

Okay. I think if I'm comparing on this, there's some it's like a chipmunk. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

Yeah, it looks really fun. Jermaine to the story or just like pretty relevant, pretty relevant, I would say, run a picture. It's kind of there a lot. Does he get closer at the end of the episode with whatever his character want is? Yeah, I don't know if he really has an arc. He's making worth the service. Yeah, it's like wrap around structures.

Characters get arcs. This is true.

No, it did in that big one. Yeah. Yeah. What was that film that that one guy? Oh, directed about him. Noah. All right. And Piper, a doggy aka Tiffany. Blastered. Blastered. Yeah.

What do you have to plug? You know, I just was here to plug and I plugged my scripts and so yeah.

Yeah. I have one more which I can tell you about. She's the girl who changes her catalytic converter by herself. By herself on which day though? Oh, I couldn't figure out how to make that holiday movie because all the other parts are close. The other ones were actually, yeah, could be a for the July movie. Yeah. Because it's kind of like, you know, loud or something. I know.

Why are you getting nervous? I was really. You realize it was a terrible idea in the middle of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you want to make them happy because it's director and star. They're on board too far and I sure make sure they're still hungry.

She's a typical. She's a typical brand. Learn to say no. People like stars love it when you say no. I think you have to have a body of work in order to say no to other things. Well, good luck.

And how much of the budget of our movie, by the way, a clean 25 mill, I think is exactly as anything under 25 mill. This is 25 amount. 24.99. Okay, we have a deal. Great. I want to plug.

Hey, look, the comedy bang bang book is coming out in April and you can still get a signed copy. I have looked at the numbers of how many copies I have to sign and it is really depressing. And I got the timetable for how long I have to sign this amount of copies and that doubly depressed me as well.

But you can still get a signed copy.

I said I would do as many as you guys order. Head over to comedy or CBB world or comedy bang bang world dot com slash book. You can order it from Barnes and Noble. They have all the signed copies as well as Indigo and Canada. They have the signed copies.

And if you just want a regular copy, we have all the links for you over there. It comes out in April. And I have seen the final proofs of it. It is very good. You all are going to love it.

All right, let's close up the old plug bag.

We're opening up the plug bag. When you open up the plug bag, you open it up your heart.

It is blood. I was on a prayer by Mac Lekner. Thank you to Mac Lekner for that. Thank you.

Guys, I want to thank you so much. Natalie Gillian, two of my faves. Thank you so much for returning. Good luck with the movie and CJT the man 9888 under score unlimited. I hate you.

Never want to see you again. And I'll see you next week.

And Tiffany. Tiffany blastered.

I'll be seeing you on set. Can't wait. I'm honored. Thanks.

And Calvin. Let's see that dick one more time. What do you say? Tell off buddy. You insist. All right. I don't like saying that on the show here. But here we go. Whoa. That's a wide one.

Oh, that's just like that movie smile.

100 mil domestic. All right. We'll see you next time.

Thanks. Bye.

You I'm going to go back to the next one.
