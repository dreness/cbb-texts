♪♪♪ The Hamburgler, Bergl Burgers, while the Grimace grabbed your grapes, Ronald McDonald watched it all while Mayor McCheese filmed the tape. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang! That's a longin'! That's okay. It's a... you know, it's a fun, thematic thing with the McDonald Land characters. I think you'll change your mind once you hear who submitted it. Uh-oh. Thank you to Shitty Butthole for that catchphrase submission. Yeah. Come on. I know. Almost didn't pick it because of that, but I did, and there it is.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang! This is the best of Comedy Bang Bang 2019, part 404! If it ain't, then... Don't fix it.

Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's what I'm gonna say. Yeah, if it ain't broke, don't say. Thank you, Paul. That'll be all for you.

Goodbye, Paul! Goodbye, Paul!

Strange. Strange. It has been. It really has. I mean, who said that the Grateful Dead? Who said that the Grateful Dead? Who said that the Grateful Dead? Does he sing Jeremy Bivens? I was just about to say that. I was thinking about that the other day.

Jeremy Pivens? Jeremy Pivens? Jeremy Pivens? Yeah!

♪♪ Been a long time since we've done that one. Been a long time. Been a long time. Been a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long.

Okay, okay. By the way, this is... This is someone's first episode of Comedy Bang Bang. Good. I'm glad. I'm glad.

Maybe they love singing. Maybe they love singing. Not everybody's a fucking Scrooge about it. You know what I mean? Capris. Like, oh, so I'm singing.

You know why? Because they can't sing. Yeah, they have no joy in their lives. So joy. They should visit each other at Christmas Eve. Hey, what's up? Jason, hey, John. Thanks for coming over. Thanks for coming over as a ghost. They're both ghosts? Yeah, they're ghosts to each other. Let's kill them both. Oh, no, we have to stop making these jokes.

Especially when it seems like we did something. I know.

Yeah, I don't want to leave any evidence. Let's definitely...

I don't want to leave any evidence. By the way, Paula Cole.

Yeah? I did not know this. I got a live record from Peter Gabriel from the early 90s. It was nice of him to say. He was so nice. She said it was a Paula Cole? No, of him, of his own.

I thought you would love this Paula Cole album. No, and there's someone singing on almost every song. I look it up.

It's Paula Cole, and that's how she got her start.

You know, she does that in Where of All the Cowboys, Gus?

She does, yes. But that's fun to suddenly get a job. And you're out there touring the world with Peter Gabriel and singing duets with him.

And then you record your own record, and Dawson's Creek goes, Hey, I want that.

And that's the story. That's how Paula Cole, knowing those more about it and me, Jason Mumba.

Jason Mumba loves Paula Cole. I love Paula Cole. I love Paula Cole, don't I? I love her. I write proper love. Paula Cole.

I'm starting to realize why the fourth of four Best Hoves is the least listened to. We have...

You should be the most smart power. We definitely. You got Jason Mumba on. You know what I'm listening. Make sure you include it in the metadata.

Jason Mumba guest stars. Oh, right. All right. All right.

All right. All right. What have we got here? Best of comedy, baby, part four.

I realize you stopped talking and I was just taking the cup up to my lips to take a drink. Bring that cup up to your lips, hallejim. That did it. Thank you.

Take a long, deep draft of water. Mine, you know, getting water, boops. What is this? Episode three? I'm not going to do that.

Revenge of the Sith. Star Wars, by the way. Star Wars, by the way. Okay. We covered it. Star Wars, by the way.

I think we were doing these best of two years ago when Star Wars, by the way. Yeah. Now here we are. Star Wars, by the way.

I talked about my love of the character of Rey. Yes. That's right. I'm proud of her. I'm proud of Rey. I'm proud of you, Rey.

I'm proud of you. Maybe that's why I wasn't invited to the premiere of the new moon because I was yelling at the screen during the last premiere. I'm proud of you.

Well, this is a different director, is it not? Yeah, this director, he don't care for me. The previous director knives out.

Fucking love that movie. Yeah, knives out. That's right up your eye. I saw it yesterday. I would imagine. Right up my eye. Right up the old a hole.

Outed it. Loved it. Hey, you snuck something in there. I did. That was rude. Mm-hmm.

But I would imagine you would have been good at any of those parts, but as the part James Bond played. James Bond.

That's why I'm thinking of it.

I thought he was great. He was really fun. I thought he was great. He was funny. He's singing along the car of the race.

Losing my mind. Yeah. Not looking left. Not looking right.

Oh, really funny. It's great. I'm laughing. Remembering it.

Yeah.

Go see it knives out. Good movie. What's your favorite movie this year? I haven't seen it. At this point. It might have been that. It might have been that.

I don't go out to the movies that much anymore. Yeah, you let the movies come to you. Yeah, yes. I do. You hire all the actors. Yes. So do the movie for me. You get the grips all the way. Yes.

Sambo, Sambo and living room, please. Now, I've never seen this movie and I wanted to be very good. I wanted to be exactly what you did.

Everyone try the very best. And now take me to Avengers Land. Avengers Land. I don't know what it's called.

Two very different movies. I think any movie with the Avengers is an adventure land. You're taking your trip to adventure. True.

My favorites this year as of press time. I didn't ask. You didn't ask. Okay.

I'm surprised. I know. I want to know though. I like parasite. I like book smart. Haven't seen parasite. Haven't seen book smart. Those are both great.

They're great. But I haven't seen a lot at this point. But I like those two. I like us. I like. I like us. I forgot that. That was this year. Yeah. I like Avengers Endgame.

Obviously.

And I still have not seen quite a bit of the movies that are out there. So are you going to see that new dramatic Ghostbusters? The zero last Ghostbusters.

But 100% more kids. Yeah. 100%. You think people complain about this Ghostbusters? I don't even want to get into it.

Of course they will. Somebody cares. They're kids. I did as a joke and people got mad at me.

It's so weird to be like defending a movie from a joke. Defending a movie from a joke. Yeah.

You don't know what it's going to be like. You don't see a movie. You don't see a movie. Movie my friend. My friend is movie.

Your friend is joke. Don't be me. Do movie with joke.

The one thing about democratizing the internet and the social media making everyone even playing field. It is weird to me that everyone now is a media critic.

It's always been, I think, people's hobby or like people go, oh, it would have been fun to be a movie critic. Now everyone is one.

Everyone's had their opinions, but no one else had to hear them before. Yeah.

Now we have to hear all of our opinions all the time. All the time. Every day is all. It's opinion day.

And there's nothing we can do about it. We're forced to be a tripped.

We're trapped. Oh, well. Well, speaking of opinions, speaking of and being over soon, that both ties into our countdown because these are the opinions of the listeners of what the top four episodes of comedy bang bang are of this year.

And it is also going to be over soon. Yeah, all of it. Not soon enough. I'll tell you that much. Take a look at the runtime of this episode. It is a long one.

But let me just explain the concept of the show because even though this is the least listened to episode of our countdown.

Keep seeing it. What if this was the most this year? It makes me not want to try.

It is undoubtedly someone's first episode. Comedy Bang Bang is a show where I host it and I talk to celebrities, actors, comedians, musicians.

And I also have comedians on who are playing fake people.

They're playing characters.

That's where I come in. I'm Paul F. Tompkins. I'm one of those people. Some say the best one.

Some would. I mean, you have been on the best of every single year. We've been doing it and that cannot be said for everyone.

Not everyone can boast such an achievement. I wonder if there is anyone who's made an appearance on the best of every single year.

I don't want to know. I don't want to know. If I don't want to know, it's not all the best of every year. It's me. It's not all the best of the long time ago.

I wonder if Andy Dayle has. He maybe would be the closest.

Yeah, I would. Jason Manzukas. I don't know. One of those two maybe.

I bet. I bet Andy. I'm not sure. I mean, there have been some. No one knows. There have been some years, I think, where Andy was doing a review where he was too busy to do the show.

We're not busy. We're not busy. We have all the time in the world. Oh, no. My life. My life. My wife. Do you remember that guy? My wife. She was my life. Which guy was that? My wife. My wife. My wife. My wife. What was that? That was a previous. It was a commercial for.

Like it was an anti smoking commercial, maybe, where the wife smoked herself. Yeah, but it was us talking about it, singing my wife. And then we say yes. On a previous best of.

Yes. For sure. For sure. We've circled back. True heads.

All the favorites. True heads will know. Oh boy.

Well, this we're so this episode are the top four. Every year we put out a poll. This episode are the top four. Oh, geez.

You know, when you make fun of me, you try talking this much and be coherent. Oh, he's a Burt Ockerman logic on me.

Yeah. Yeah. Like he says talking about George Bush. Yeah.

This seems like Obama managed to do it for eight years without settling a fucking away. He's reading a prompter.

No, but this these are top four. And these are top four. It cannot be denied about this. We're doing every year we put out a poll where people can vote for their 10 favorite episodes and we tally up the results and we then look rank them in order descending order from 15 to one. And so we're doing the top 15 this year and this episode will be doing four, three, two and one. Now this is sad because this is the first year since we've done the ranking that the ranking has not been done by the ranking Roger. That's true. He is passed away. He came in a toaster and lead singer of English beat. Yeah, he would come in and he would rank the episodes for us. People don't know that. He did it for. He would do it for everything like best of the decade list best of the rank things. He would do all top 10 lists for movies. Yeah. He would do them separately for each person. Yeah. This is like that. He never got to finish his ultimate goal, which was ranking everyone in the phone book.

I came in, by the way, at I was like 258,368. Oh, I was like in the thousands. Oh, you were up there. Really? Wow.

Yeah. He loved you. Yeah. Yeah. And I loved him. I'm going to miss him forever. I liked liked him.

I wish you'd said something. I would have told him because he felt the same way about you. Look, could have been ranked higher. You go. Well, say number one. And obviously, if you've been hearing all of these episodes, Paul and I have taken out an entire day to tape all of these. And at this point, we are not coherence and I don't think this is the fastest we've ever done it. We've been racing through them. And I still feel like we've been here for 40 hours.

Well, normally we took a lunch. We would go offsite and take a lunch break. This time we had the food came to us, much like these movies come to you. It's wild. What a time.

What a time it is. Well, I mean, someone here at your wolf went out and picked it up. Yes. But another, I think that helped maintain the energy. Yes. Probably not. Who knows?

We'll see. I think last year we walked to a restaurant and then walked all the way back. Like he's savage, like cavemen.

But we did meet a baby. Do you remember that? No, I don't.

What baby did we meet? We went to the restaurant nearby here and then someone that I had worked with on the LA Complex. Yes. Was there with her husband, Georgina Riley?

Right. Is there with her husband, Marco, Brian, another actor? Right. And they have a baby who presumably is going to be an actor. I hope so. And we met that baby. And that was a good meeting. That was a good meeting. Yeah. Yeah, I feel good about that baby. We had a general. We had a general with a baby.

Yeah. We made a great impression. Now, another staple of these episodes is that we played the Snowman game. This will be a final one of the year.

You think this is the final Snowman game? Okay. I think so.

We could play one at the end of this episode as well if you do not get selected. Okay. All right.

Now, here's what it is for people who for some reason don't know what this is. It's a Snowman toy. It's a singing and dancing snowman.

Yes. He's a jolly little fellow. He's got a rosy cheeks for some reason. Certainly is.

We're at a scarf. He's holding a candy cane. I would say his cheeks are about to melt. They're so rosy.

Do you think like there's a person trapped inside and their body he's showing? Yes. There's like starting to melt the snow?

I think no. I think there are snow capillaries and veins all made out of snow. Snow organs.

Snorgans. Snorgans board. Mr. Police man. Give you all the clues. So you press his little fat hand and then he's...

He can't hear me. Fat fuck? He's singing too well. Fat fuck can't hear me. He's singing too well.

He's singing too well. He's singing too well. He's singing too well.

So he presses his hand and then he spins around while he sings let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

During this song, he stops four times at a different place.

And if he stops...

He laughs on you. Looking at you, it feels so good. Oh, it feels so good.

So this end pal, he's never looked at Paul. He's looked at...

Not this round.

He's looked over Paul's shoulder, certainly. He's looked over the shoulder.

But he has never looked and gazed into Paul of Tompkins.

Lovely. Brown eyes, green eyes. I'm not sure exactly what he's doing.

You really don't know what kind of my fucking eyes are. How long have you been fucking?

You can't move by the way. You've moved into where he actually is now.

I'm sorry. You need to move back to where you were. I'm trying to get video.

Yeah, but you got to get it if he looks at you. Not it.

Okay. Are we ready?

Yes, here we go. All right, we're taking video. Press his little fat hand.

Press his little fat hand. Here he goes. He's now sitting now. He's spinning around. He's spinning around. And...

He looked... Sam got it. Sam got it. And now...

No, it's a no one to the corner. It's not looking good. It's not looking good.

I don't know. Maybe. Maybe. Oh, he's looking at Kevin.

This is your last chance, Paul, unless we do it at the very end.

No, he looked at nobody. All right, let's do it at the end just to see if you can get it.

All right. Speaking of getting it, let's get to our number four episode.

What are you saying? This is your number four. Number four.

Oh, okay.

This is episode 579 from December 17th.

It's so, so early. So early before the curious clump.

So before the curious clump. Now, what we do is we...

The eligibility period is Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving every year.

That's right. That's right. So this is December 17th.

So this may have been the earliest episode that we have in the countdown.

That's a while. Maybe we will see. We will see.

This is episode 579 from December 17th.

This is the 2018 holiday spectacular. Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

Well, I mean, it's unfair. There's so much good stuff going on.

So much talent. So many great people.

Every year on Comedy Bang Bang for the final regular episode of the year, I put out a big call to our favorites to see if they can come at a certain time and I'll join in on what turns out to be 20 people talking over each other.

Oh, yes. And then all of the men...

Once the two women are gone, then all of the men really come into their own as screamers.

By the way, not everyone that I invite shows up and not everyone who says they're going to show up comes.

That's also true. And that certainly happened this year.

It's booking things is tough.

It's tough. I don't know what to say. And especially this time of year.

And there are a lot of lonely guys who have nothing better to do than come to this show.

Yeah, but this year, there were only...

On this episode that we're about to do has some great people.

Jason Manzuchus was on this. Jessica McKenna, who we talked about earlier in our countdown.

John Gabris, Lauren Lapkes, Mike Hanford, Nick Weiger, Paul F. Tomkins, Ryan Gull, Sean Diston, Thomas Middleditch, Tim Balts, Will Hines, and Zeke Nicholson.

They all made appearances on this episode.

And what we're going to hear, we're going to hear four clips.

Sort of a representative for...

I know for sure one of them is.

Which one do you think it is?

I think there's a song involved.

Yes, there is a song involved in one of them.

Yes, yes.

So what we're going to hear is these are the four clips that I pulled.

But of course, the entire two hour or 15 minute episode is all great.

But the four clips, first we have...

We've talked about John Gabris as intern Geno a bit, but we haven't heard a clip of him.

So we're going to hear his opening...

Because they're opening Gambit.

His opening salvo, what intern Geno, who is a character that John Gabris does, which is not too far from his actual personality.

And exaggerated version of John.

But he's great.

He's one of our favorite guests and people love him.

And so we're going to hear him for a bit.

Then we are going to hear Paul F. Tomkins here, and Lauren Lapkes, as Santa Claus and Big Sue.

Now Big Sue is a character that Lauren has been doing a lot, and Santa Claus is someone that Paul F. Tomkins has been doing.

And on this episode, they both got together and teamed up.

That's right.

As a superhero team up.

Press over and over.

Then we are going to hear...

This was a very popular segment.

We're going to hear Thomas Middleditch come in as Big Dog.

Big Dog.

That's right.

And that's a very funny clip.

And it was so funny for it's literally five minutes, but spawned a best-selling t-shirt.

And a terrible t-shirt.

It's just the ugly shirt we've ever put out, and I love it.

And then the final clip we are going to hear is Nick Weiger.

And that's the aforementioned song, and that is something that we normally do on the Halloween episodes.

But the Halloween episodes basically have gotten too difficult to schedule.

Everyone's sort of schedules have gone off, have become so different.

The participants who have traditionally done those episodes are now scattered to the winds in terms of scheduling.

They're just too hard to pull off every year.

So we haven't done them for a couple of years, but on this particular year, people were so upset that Nick Weiger did not do his song that year, that we invited him to do it on the holiday episode.

So let's hear those.

These are your favorite clips.

I don't know if these are your favorite clips, but this is definitely your top four episode.

This is your number four.

Number four.

I do have to say, Gino, that we've been getting complaints from some of our female guests that you've been pouring water on their shirts as they enter into the building.

Yes, and that's because their shirts, first of all, some of them are coming in in dry sweaters, and you can't have that much static around equipment like this.

It's much safer to be wet around this much equipment.

That's why I heard you say out in the lobby, we got a wet down that wool.

Yeah, we got a wet the wool, baby.

We got a wet that wool.

This is not a Jersey Shore situation.

This is not the type of show.

Don't you ever fuck it.

I will never go to the Jersey Shore.

Oh, that's right.

You're from Long Island.

The South Shore of Long Island, Nassau County, don't you ever.

What do you have out there?

Do you have a Jersey Shore type place?

Yeah, we have a fucking beach.

You mean?

We're a fucking island, bro.

We have the whole South Shore.

We got Jones Beach.

We got Long Beach.

We got Lido point look out.

Which is like the best.

Robin Moses.

The best beach.

Jones Beach Field 6.

If you wanted to take the train to Jones Beach Field 6, you could jump on the Long Island Railroad at Penn Station, hit Jamaica, Rockville Center, Baldwin, Freeport, Merrick, Belmoa, Wantos, Seaford, Mesopique, what Mesopique, what park?

Amityville, Copig, Lindenhurst, and Babylon.

Baby.

Yes.

But you get off at Belmore and the train down there.

But that's how the rest of the train line goes.

Sure.

Yeah.

Have you ever gone further than that?

You're going to fall asleep and wake up someplace that you were like, just in Connecticut.

Yes.

I fell asleep one time and I woke up and I was in the Montauk Lighthouse.

Oh, no.

Did this make you go up and raise?

I was inside.

And the only way I found out was inside Lighthouse because I opened my eyes at the same time as the light passed me and I thought I was dead.

Oh, gosh.

Oh, yeah.

Don't go into that light.

Yeah.

Get up with that bright light.

And then I was fucking remissed to find out I was a lot.

You really missed to find out.

I was upset when I found out I was upset.

You wanted to be dead.

At that moment I was like, well, I'm dead.

It's easy.

I kind of like got into it.

Did you feel a sense of relief?

Yeah.

How long before you realized you weren't dead?

It was six days.

Six days.

So you thought the lighthouse was some sort of heaven?

Yeah.

And then I started to be like, this feels like a very specific pattern.

I hear things and the weather's changing and I'm getting hungry and I thought I would be dead.

So you went into acceptance very quickly in the Dabda.

Oh, you got it.

What's the Dabda?

The denial, anger.

Oh, the seven stages of jail.

Seven stages of jail.

I think it's high x maybe.

Yeah.

I believe it's bargaining.

Bargaining.

That's right.

Betrayal.

Well, you didn't even know Dabda.

You don't know Dabda.

I'm like dealing with grief.

How are you feeling?

I'm just betrayed about it.

I'm in the betrayal phase.

I turned my back on my own grief.

I've been betrayed.

But you just went through them really quickly.

Got right to acceptance.

Like, oh, yeah, I just assumed I was dead.

So I was like, it'd just be easier if I'm dead now.

So that makes easy on whom?

On yourself or on your family?

On me, for sure.

No, don't feel that way during the holidays.

Well, once I wasn't dead, I would have been very sad for us.

Yeah.

Was it?

It wasn't because we didn't know about any of this happening.

Right.

To be honest, I don't know when we would find out that it had happened because Gina was so infrequent here.

Yeah.

That's my bad because I'm dealing with some medicine.

Because I'm dealing with some medical issues back home.

Really?

What's going on?

For yourself or for someone else?

For myself.

I have, like, constant pink sock.

You know?

No, I don't.

I mean, like, there's some problem with your laundry?

No, it's, yeah, no, it's, I wish.

God help me if I could just have a problem with my laundry.

Wait, what's your first problem?

There's a problem with the laundry.

I get the dryer and the washer confused all the time.

And I was going to close in the dryer first.

And then it just heats up all the filth that's on it.

And it stinks up my whole house.

And then you're going to school sopping wet.

Hey, but no static shock, baby.

Yeah.

Got a wet that, whoa.

Keep the wool wet, baby.

But what's the problem with your, uh, I have, uh, I have, uh, pink sock.

Yes, I have near constant pink sock, which is, I don't know what, I don't know what.

That's a prolapsed anus.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

So what if you're saying what it looks like, six and out of your hands?

Yeah, I have a little tiny tail and you have to keep it in a bowl of cold water so that nothing happens to it.

Okay.

Because I get anything to stick to it.

Does it grow like one of those little sponges?

Yeah.

Like shrinkage?

No, I guess those are the opposite.

You gotta, you gotta put those in the oven.

If it's not in, if it's not in water and like, lint gets on it, then you're dead.

Oh, no.

You don't want to get lint on your pink sock.

You're walking around your university, sopping wet with a bowl of water and your prolapse anus next to you.

Yes.

First thought, the community college.

Yeah.

I'm driving my Jeep Wrangler, sitting on top of a bowl of, uh, tepid water with my pink sock in it.

And then I kind of just soak.

Can you?

Yeah.

Can you?

Yeah.

Can you, can you like just soak it before you go?

Can you soak something, your underwear is something that, oh, I tried, I tried everything, but it's, you know, cause it's like a burn in a way.

Is it the kind of thing like a tapeworm, you lure a tapeworm out of your mouth or anything?

Yeah.

Can you get a tapeworm to like eat it back in?

Like, is it your body going to suck it back in at some point?

One of the best ways to get it back in I've learned is one gentle peg.

Okay.

One gentle peg.

Just to be pegged gently one.

Okay.

Or you can hold the vacuum to your mouth like a high powered vacuum.

Okay.

Like a shop vac.

If you put it, so you're saying you just have to get the right amount of pressure from your mouth.

Yeah.

To draw your prolapse.

Staying is back in here.

Yeah.

And what, what is it back up like finishing a plate of pasta?

You can't just finger that right back in.

Oh, no, you can, but you should wear a glove and it's got to be a big finger.

Did you find like a foam finger?

Like, that actually helps.

If you can get a glove over a New York Giants foam finger, it really gets it back in there.

If it doesn't fit, you must.

Yeah.

Dain Cook would love this.

She'd be like, I bought five in the pink.

You guys know this guy?

Dain Cook?

You got to have him on the show.

Dain Cook.

Oh, yeah.

Dain Cook is brother.

Does he Dain at your university?

Yes.

Dain Cook.

He came once when Dain was performing at Hofstra and then stole the team plate of NASA.

Yeah.

And then he started doing, you know, shock and material.

He's doing a concurrent cook act in every city.

And he gives college tour gazoms.

But let me say, I had to do this because when I married you and don't look at it, I got a defensive.

I aged so rapidly I wanted to figure it out.

Could I do a calendar that made up for it?

That's right.

So I have a special calendar for my magical aging.

Yeah.

Now, what I try to tell her is, yes, you do look a lot older, personally.

I like it.

It's very, very, you know, old bitches.

You're immortal now.

So that's not bad.

Right.

You look almost exactly like his previous wife.

And you know what they say.

You know what's interesting.

We don't, like, we don't have a previous wife.

We don't have a previous wife.

We don't care.

When I...

She passed?

She did pass.

She did more than...

She passed the road sound on her way to hell.

Oh my God.

Let me tell you something.

Sue.

Have you heard my new laugh?

I guess I haven't unless you've done it already.

None of you say you think funny yet.

Oh yeah.

This is not a funny show.

This is so good.

It's about long-dumb road.

Where do you hear this?

It's fine.

Can you be a common character?

I'm so proud of her.

Oh!

I'm crying with laughter.

Oh God.

You literally are.

Oh my gosh.

I'm crying.

Well, Mrs. Claus.

On the third hall, a moth came out of your mouth.

Yeah, cool.

Finally, I've been trying to get rid of that.

Oh, so you see my tears there, individual snowflakes.

Each unique, one different than the last.

Do you have any special powers?

Yep, watch this.

Whoa!

She got you.

A full candy cake.

We love each other.

We love each other so much.

I love this bad.

She's the most generous man I've ever met.

What a track you give you to him.

I'm fucking cynical.

Every year he gives gifts to gifts for nothing.

Yeah!

As long as they're all there, all that you do is be good.

Can I ask a question, Santa?

Do you have children from your first marriage?

And how do they feel about you getting marriage so quick?

Yeah, believe you're going to bring this.

This is the kind of show.

Well, did not publicist give you a list of topics?

It's not the greatest.

Wait, did you write a book?

It's from a discussion.

No, a publicist.

A publicist.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm supposed to give you a list of topics we didn't want to discuss.

That being won.

Oh.

And as he's a grown man.

You have children?

Well, I had children.

Past?

Yes.

Oh, wait, are they...

Past- No, they're adults.

No, they have disowned it.

They've disowned you.

They're not happy with my new life.

Wow.

Even though it's the same as it's been, I just haven't knew.

Same as it ever was.

This is my beautiful wife.

And hello.

So, are they upset that your previous wife passed away?

They are upset that I remarried so quickly.

How quickly?

How quickly was it?

My first wife was not quite dead.

But the marriage was dead for years.

The marriage had been dead for years.

Come on.

So you were getting happy?

Can you have a little life?

I can't have a little life.

And how did you meet?

We've been in a friend's house.

Oh, wow.

Mutual friend?

Yeah, mutual friend.

I hate him though.

But I ease a friend.

More of a friend of me for sure.

Yeah, absolutely.

Who's house?

I hate the one we know.

Yeah, you know him.

You know him.

Everyone knows him.

It's the most famous reindeer of all.

Oh.

Wait, Rudolph.

Dancer?

No, no, no.

I will tell him you said that though, because this fucking is hysterical.

You will hate it.

Don't, don't please.

I can't help it.

I'm texting him.

I'm fucking hysterical.

You said it wrong.

I can't be mad with you.

Oh, oh, oh, that's fucking hysterical.

Sue, where do you know Rudolph from?

From my childhood's festival.

He landed on my roof, went clip-clop all night fucking long.

I went fucking ape, shut the shit out of his leg.

No one even tells me he only has three.

That was a weird year.

We lost Rudolph for a good week and a half.

I didn't know where he was.

Last week in the house.

Yeah, he didn't get back.

He stuck inside my chimney.

He tried to get in to get revenge.

They're not supposed to go in there.

I know.

His antlers wouldn't even fit for the mora.

He's not smart.

Of course we hung out for you guys.

Let me go hang out with you.

The nose is the brightest thing about him.

I hate it.

I hate him, but he's hysterical, but I hate him.

He's all right.

He's not so bad.

Sometimes there's funny shit.

What do you mean?

Well, he does funny shit.

Oh, okay.

Like clown.

Like Monopoly.

Like he's clown-flip.

Yeah.

And then you decide each other and love bloomed.

The two of us?

I was struck by it right away.

Who do you think we're talking about?

I was struck by a runaway.

She was eating a pizza.

Oh, yes.

I was housing it.

I lifted it up.

She was growing.

Then I have again.

The whole thing.

Did not cut into triangles.

Bit the triangle part.

Opie it up on my face through.

Yeah.

Like one of those cats bred on Instagram.

And I wanted to be a meme because I was really struggling with my business.

And I was trying to become a meme and get really money.

So I should really, really money.

She wanted to get really money.

Just in my bank account, we really money.

Right.

The time is really empty.

And memes are a good way to do that.

And I'm not the gold digger, but I did find a great guy.

Yeah, but you guys have no money.

You're not selling anything.

You're not just getting everything away.

And it sounds like you're taking Santa into your- What a sidetrack.

You've sidetracked him away from his main business.

I'm sorry, I don't understand how you don't get- Let me tell you something.

Can we live?

Thousands of years old.

No one makes me do anything I don't want to do.

Okay.

Cool.

All right.

There's no Santa curse.

Like see your kid.

He's not.

Okay.

Nobody makes you see your kid.

Do you want to leave?

I think you're going to get some coal up your fucking ass.

Should we go?

Should we leave?

No, guys, please stand.

Don't let them ruin this for us.

We are here to promote our business.

Okay.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

Oh, I know.

We're at the North Pole, idiot.

I just noticed something.

When we all woke up from this dream, there's someone new sitting here in the room.

What?

Who's this guy?

What's up, dude?

It's me, Big Dog.

How's it going?

Big Dog, Big Dog.

Big Dog.

He's never met before.

No, dude.

I just stumbled on in here with a steaming hot plate of nachos.

Went to Crutchtown.

Crutchtown?

Crutchtown.

I don't go to Crutchtown on nachos.

I crunched him.

Crutchtown.

I sounded like Crutchtown.

Yeah, I did.

I'm looking pretty soggy, but having it for a while.

Oh, yeah.

I keep these nachos moist and wet.

Oh, no, Crutchtown.

Like a good wolf sweater.

You got to keep it moist and wet.

Oh, a wall wet, baby.

Oh, baby.

You guys are talking my kind of sauce.

Big Dog.

Santa Claus, North Pole.

Hey, what's going on, dude?

How are you able to crunch the nachos if they're moist and wet?

Your skilled nachos like I ain't even crunched just about anything.

I could crunch moist talent.

Oi's toilet?

No, no.

Hey, tell him.

Come on, geez.

Come on.

Hey, I was unclalting.

That was unclalting.

That was a good one.

You know, I apologize.

I apologize.

You know, our new friend is the big dog.

I'm sorry, big dog.

Don't do toilet.

Big dog, don't hold no grudges.

I didn't know that about Big Dog.

You're sure it's written right on his shirt?

Are you kidding me?

I wasn't looking down there.

That's how you did it.

This t-shirt available in this shop in the earwelf store, big dog.

Don't hold no grudges.

That's where I get on my roof, brothers.

Can I get curx or whatever?

Pronits?

Can I get a silk screen on the floor?

You sure can.

Absolutely.

Nothing sticks to thick foam better than three-grant.

Well, buddy, I want to get a picture of the big old plate of nachos, fully dressed with...

Fully dressed?

Nothing making nachos?

No way, man.

I want them all.

I want them sour cream.

I want them saucer.

You know I want some gawk and you know I want some cheese.

You know I want half gallon of blood.

Hold on.

Did you guys all hear that, Maasper?

That was the only thing on the shop on the earth.

It's very less than you said.

Hold on.

I used your old for dog.

I like a red sauce.

I love a little round pie with a tomato paste.

We all know that about you.

Hold on.

If you're in the mood for pepperoni, you could.

Maybe some blood.

Hold on.

I like milk.

Sometimes cookies on the side.

Our new friend, Big John.

Big John.

You're a big old.

A round cookie.

Carrot for the rain.

Our new friend, Big John.

Is the back of your sweatshirt say woof woof?

You know it.

Oh, my.

Oh, it's spelled wrong.

We have to ask you.

A lot of things written on the show.

Of course it is.

Don't be on your web.

I got eat shit on my right arm.

And who did that on my left?

And these are all catch raises.

Yeah, I'm a big dog.

For a new character already.

Four to five catch raises.

You just throw those arms up when you're on your bicycle, depending on what the person behind you just did.

Girl, you know it.

This is dangerous.

The amount that you're adding so quickly.

Yeah, trust me.

You can't do that too much.

I love nachos.

I got a couple catch raises.

And you always wear roller blades with triple the wheels.

If your blades don't got 12 wheels, you're not playing right.

Tell you that much right now.

So, it's not too much.

This character is overwhelming.

I like nachos.

Why are you twerking?

Jigsaw buzzer pizzas everywhere.

And you've all fallen asleep.

Oh, that's it.

That's why.

You're here.

And nobody said we just fell asleep.

You just fell asleep.

That was all real.

I'm not going to say that.

I'm not interested.

It's the holidays.

It's the end of the year.

I'm not interested in a Halloween song.

I'm interested in a...

This is about the festival of light.

Although it does have...

My subject, matter, my bread and butter, is the spooky genre.

So it has a spooky element.

Well, Christmas Carol has ghost in it.

I understand that.

So this is my new song, Haunted Cuh.

Haunted Cuh.

We'll be debuting my normal backup singer, Scaryline.

My granddaughter passed away.

However...

Oh, oh, oh.

Sorry.

That's a spooky reveal.

A lot of deaths today.

Yeah, she passed away this past year and she isn't hell now.

Wow.

How do you know that?

She is sinned.

She committed a lot of sins.

But my grandson is here.

Hello, my grandpa.

I love you too, Killiam.

Thank you for being here.

Killiam, boy.

Killiam.

I love that I get to hang out with you.

Killiam, if you met Beth, you're about the same age.

What?

That girl over there in the corner?

I think it's a boy.

Is it a boy or a girl?

No, I'm a boy.

That girl in the corner doing donuts in a real car.

Yeah, that's an eight-year-old girl.

By the way, this is really dangerous.

Yeah!

Even just the exhaust.

You're in my head!

Beth, get on my...

In a Celica.

So Leo, you have a new song.

This is exciting.

I have a completely new song.

You're one of my favorite songwriters.

So this is...

You got a new song.

It's a...

Thank you for saying that I am one of your favorite songwriters.

You are.

I love the one that you've written.

Well, this is a...

Well, that hurts me, you know.

But it's great.

Well, we don't even remember your songs.

We've talked about the full one.

I am so fucking sorry, Jason.

I've lived a long life and I've been dead before.

I'm sorry.

John, we were once contemporaries.

Time is age-y.

What if that's true?

You are frozen in time.

What a...

You are ageless.

I look great.

What a weird thing to acknowledge that is true.

That just let it into the guy room.

Not to vanish.

Roughly the same age.

You were there for that.

You are.

Of course I am.

You are.

It's okay.

We were talking about that.

We were sort of racing to write the same song and I just couldn't get it done.

You were working on it.

We were doing...

A spookie walk.

It was about a ghost who got legs and walked around.

Oh, wow.

Why?

Why would he need to?

He can float.

Why did you have to...

Or they can float around.

So it was like a sort of scary little mermaid.

That's right.

Okay, look.

Leo, we got to get to this song.

That Disney found the notebook I was writing in this.

This is called Haunted Cut.

It's my spooky Hanukah song for the Festival of Lights.

Festival of Frights, if you will.

Ooh.

I was working in the lab the first Hanukah night when my eyes beheld.

An eerie sight for my monster from his slab began to rise.

When suddenly, to my surprise, his trousers dropped right to the floor.

With his bottom bare, he ran to the door.

I said Frankenstein, what's gotten into you?

He said my dick is hard and I need to screw.

He did the fuck?

He did the monster fuck.

The monster fuck?

It was a graveyard fuck.

He did the fuck?

That monster sucked and fucked.

He did the fuck?

He did the monster fuck part seven, haunted cut.

From my laboratory, I heard quite the racket.

Deep in the castle, the vampires jacked it.

The zombies all fucked in the graveyard grass.

That man wolfed down Frankenstein's ass.

They did the fuck?

They did the monster fuck.

The monster fuck?

It was a graveyard.

They did the fuck?

Those monsters sucked and fucked.

They did the fuck?

They did the monster fuck.

The beast saw fucked as the orgy spread.

Bigfoot gave the headless horseman head.

The swamp thing jerked off in the castle mopping.

While Frankenstein gagged from the chisiness throat.

The fucking was wet.

There was spooge like mad.

Igor decided to fuck his own dad.

The mummy let out a horty moan win, but this is bad tits turned his dick to stone.

They did the fuck?

They did the monster fuck.

The monster fuck?

It was a graveyard.

They did the fuck?

Those monsters sucked and fucked.

They did the fuck?

They did the monster fuck.

And Frankenstein's bride was horny as hell.

The hunchback went bare back and rang her bell.

She got titty fucked by a giant spider.

The hunchback made the streaks in her hair much wider.

She fucked every monster come one come all.

Her three holes were filled like a bowling ball.

And all skeletons honed his undead bride.

Frankenstein just jacked off in crime.

Now you should fuck.

It's now the monster fuck.

The monster fuck.

And it's a graveyard.

The monster fuck.

Those monsters sucked and they fucked.

Now you should fuck.

Now you can monster fuck.

Part seven, hunt and go.

Wow.

Oh.

Thank you.

Thank you for the applause.

Thank you for the ovation.

Maassal.

Leo.

Can I say something?

Oh my God.

Please.

That's the same fucking song.

You've been singing for seven years.

Yeah, I felt like I do the lyrics to this.

Me too, but I loved it.

I've never seen him singing before.

He gets quite angry into it.

He's really into it.

Super relaxed.

Very casual.

I feel like I was watching an intimate act.

Number four.

And those were presumably your favorite clips.

They were certainly the clips that I pulled after listening to the entire episode.

You said you liked this episode.

So I had the same.

I had the same.

I had the same like the clips.

By the way, a lot of people don't know that I spend days pulling these clips and listening to every episode twice.

Why do you do that?

I don't know.

Surely someone else could do that.

Well, yeah.

You trust them.

No, I don't know them.

You don't know them.

I've never met them.

So someone is doing it, but because you don't know them, you won't.

I won't meet them.

You refuse to meet them because I don't know them.

But you can't know someone so you meet them.

Everyone you know.

Oh, sure.

Sure.

Are you saying you're saying you know people that you haven't met?

Would you say meeting someone one has to be in physical proximity?

So for instance, if you had an online friend who lived across the country, have you met them?

No, you haven't.

You haven't even someone you've known for.

Surely you shake a person's hand and look them in the eye.

You haven't met that person.

Okay.

And I, when people, when people write me an email and they're like, it's nice to meet you.

We haven't met.

We've met a lot of people.

Take my hand.

Look me in the eye.

Spitting my face.

I love it.

Trample on my balls.

I'm a sick freak.

I want to be humiliated.

Shit on my chest.

By the way, this is, I have to say that this particular episode of the Best ofs is maybe the dirtiest episode of the Best ofs we've ever had.

And you'll hear that in future clips.

For sure.

Not just because of what we just did.

No, but because of the clips.

I listened to all four of these clips in a row and I was like, boy, this is a dirty episode.

And that sounds unbelievable.

So it gets a little sparser.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we are going to have the top three, the number three episode.

I can't believe we have gotten so high.

I won't believe it.

You and I have gotten so high.

We're high.

We are rolling right now.

I want to just roll through the weekend.

All right, we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We are back and we are up to.

No good.

Up to no good in the hood.

We're rascals and we're of scallions.

We're Mr. G.

We're up to the.

Time.

Let's hear from our old friend with the weather.

Lady with the weather.

What can we expect from the weather today?

We're up to the top three, Paul.

This is top three.

No playing long.

I get it.

Top three serious business.

Top three.

Yes, me.

This is crazy.

I just met you.

This is great.

We're doing Drew now.

Hey, this is crazy.

This is crazy.

Drew Tarver has one of his things.

He has to point out the insanity of a scene while it's happening.

This is crazy.

He always says this is crazy in his southern accent.

It's very funny.

We love it.

All right.

Let's get to it.

This is your number three.

Number three.

All right.

Remember, Paul, remember how the previous episode we listened to?

Number four was 579 from December 17th.

Yeah, of course.

It's all I've been thinking about.

Yeah.

Well, this is episode 578.

It's one before.

From December 13th.

A week prior?

Not even a week.

Four days prior.

Boy, boy, boy, boy.

Number.

I'm going to be a little bit more familiar with this.

I believe we did four of those perhaps.

We did.

The subsequent one is not number one.

But still, Blake did very well.

Did very well.

Bobby, really funny guy.

We scheduled the three of us together.

Of course, we never know what's going to be done or who wants to do whom or who's Zoom in whom.

Bobby came in at this particular time and you said you wanted to do Batman.

I didn't know anything other than that.

Bobby came in and he said he wanted to do Batman.

I didn't know anything other than that.

He hooked up his iPod to a chord here.

We gave him a chord.

Bobby came in and he said he wanted to do Batman.

I didn't really know anything other than that.

I didn't know anything other than that.

Two minutes from here, two minutes from there, two minutes from there, and edit it together as if it's a six minute chunk that is happening in real time.

You sneaky son of a bitch.

I cannot do that with this because the music that Bobby is playing underneath everything makes basically editing together sections of this impossible.

Yes.

You're going to hear one long uninterrupted chunk.

And he was playing stuff from the Batman Returned soundtrack? Is that correct?

He played some stuff from just a Batman soundtrack, including Prince songs.

Right.

And the Danny Elfman score from one of the Batman soundtracks.

But this was just a blast to do and just super fun.

It was a lot of fun. It was very silly.

Very silly. I don't even know why it came out as a bonus episode other than just scheduling.

I had to get it out before the end of the year or something.

Yeah. I feel like we had recorded it and it was in the can for a really long time.

Yeah, that's right.

I think it was in the can for like six months for some reason.

I don't need. Yeah. I just because I was working on the between two Ferns movie, I had recorded a lot of episodes and then I kept thinking it would come out.

And then I just kept having date specific episodes that need to come out where someone was coming on promoting something.

And then by the end of the year, I was just like, I can't wait any longer to I got to get this Batman episode.

You know what I'm doing?

But I will say that we've talked about well, let's just hear it first and we'll talk about this after the jump.

All right, here we go. This is your episode three.

Number three.

So in any case, you thought you were a member of the group because you had participated.

I assumed I was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

And what exactly happened?

I thought we were on the same page.

Is this is this music that you had brought?

It's what?

Do you hear this?

Is that not you doing that?

That's not me doing that. Is that you doing that?

Where is she?

Who's this fellow? Where is she?

Someone just dropped into the room off of my kind of a.

Look at these terrifying.

Oh my goodness.

It looks like. Oh my goodness.

Oh my goodness.

He looks like some sort of a giant flater mouse.

He looks like some sort of winged creature.

Yeah.

If I were not human, certainly not human.

If I were cowardly or superstitious, I'd be terrified right now.

But you're neither.

No, I'm regular.

You hadn't even keel usually.

I'm just a regular guy.

I'm a bit cowardly and sort of superstitious.

So I got a little bit of a criminal.

You're not a criminal, are you?

I don't believe I am part of the cowardly and superstitious lot.

But I don't believe I'm a criminal.

There is some overlap.

If there was a venn diagram of cowardly superstitious people and criminals, certainly there would be a large.

In the middle you'd see a big fat slice.

Yeah.

Excuse me.

Where is she?

Who?

Who wears who you are?

Her.

In human creature.

I'm no creature.

I'm Solomon.

I count.

Nice to meet you.

I am Scott Ocarina of Comedy.

I'm a weird big fan.

Oh, thank you so much.

Oh, that's nice to see you.

I'm a bad man.

Are you an alien?

You look like a Martian.

Who me?

Are you from under the sea?

Who me?

Are you Poseidon?

Who me?

Yes, you.

I'm bad man.

Bad man.

Bad man?

Bad man.

I'm bad man.

Bad man.

Did you say you're bad Minton?

I am the creature who stalks the night.

Bad man.

You stalk the night.

That's a time of day.

I stalk it.

What do you mean the whole time?

Well, it just, it's whenever it's dark.

It's easy to stalk it, I guess.

You always know where it's going to be.

Do we?

It's right after the night goes down.

That's where it is.

The shadows.

The night's in the shadows.

Correct.

So wait, is a shadow dark?

So during the day, you, as long as you're in a shadow, you stalk it?

Or if it looks menacing, yes.

Okay.

Well, you look menacing.

Yeah, you're menacing.

If you don't mind my saying.

Are you stalking yourself?

Yeah.

Yes, you.

Why are you keep saying who me?

We're talking to you.

I was sure.

Open up your goddamn eyes then.

It looks like you have like a.

Hey, fuck you, man.

Oh, a lot of language.

Right off the bat.

Get it.

That's a good one.

That's a great one.

I'm Batman.

Did you bring your own music?

What is this?

My own music.

This is my theme.

This is the Batman theme?

Technically, it's the uncredits, but this is the theme to badminton.

Correct.

Excuse me, sir.

You're the.

Where is she?

Where is who?

Who are you asking about, sir?

Rachel.

I think it was Rachel.

Rachel?

Was it Rachel Dawes?

Rachel.

Oh, Vicki Vale.

Vicki Vicki Vicki Vale.

She's great, isn't she?

Are you looking for one of Playboy millionaire Bruce Wayne's girlfriends?

Yes, I didn't realize that they were all.

That that would link me to him if I was just looking solely for his girlfriend.

It was Rachel Dawes.

Rachel Dawes is, she was, she works in the DA's office.

I'll leave two different actresses later.

I believe it was Katie Holmes in the first film.

Oh, I don't.

And then I kill it all, kill it all in the second.

Not ringing a bell at all.

She had a lot of opinions about the Rico effect.

As we all do.

The Rico Act, I believe.

Rico Act.

Which no one had ever heard of apparently in that film.

I'm here to stop it.

You're here to stop the Rico Act?

You're here to stop the Rico Act.

Why would we know?

Why did you come in here?

It's not dark.

I thought she came in here.

She didn't come in here.

I saw Cal outside and I thought he was...

Turn off your music.

Wait, you...

Was that my music?

You recognized me?

It was just about to get the funk up.

I don't understand.

You recognize me?

Sorry, that's my dance.

I'm sorry.

That's the band.

The band.

Did you recognize me?

I did.

You're Cal.

Scott, what I tell you, they're very exciting.

I don't think we've ever described you on this show.

How would you know what he looks like?

You're my first fan.

I'm a huge fan.

I have a picture of you over my bat cave wall.

Over the bat cave wall.

So on the ceiling?

It's 49 feet tall.

Wow.

It's over.

It's a big picture.

It's a giant picture.

Where did you get this picture?

Is there a Google image search that you did or...

Funny enough, the Joker made it to piss me off but...

You know, I was a huge fan.

The who?

No, the no, they...

I've never met them but the Joker.

Who's this Joker?

The Joker is a...

What's his name?

It's just the guy you know is a Joker.

Gosh, I mean, there's a lot of backstory to this one.

Thank you.

He was in Red Hood originally.

The Red Hood, okay.

But before that he was...

All sorts of things.

What was his name?

We're talking WB here also because then...

Then we gotta do like...

W-W-B?

Jack...

W-W-W-B.

Jack Napier, right?

Correct.

Jack Napier, then the Red Hood, then the Joker.

Correct.

Okay.

So what do you...

Like Alan Napier?

The actor who played Alfred the Butler?

Alfred.

The Butler?

The Butler.

On that old 60s TV show, I can't remember the name of it.

I don't know.

What are you doing here?

I'm trying to save the world.

You're trying to save the world.

The world?

The whole entire world.

The entire world.

What's the danger from darkness?

Usually don't you...

I don't know a lot about the Batman.

Clearly.

I do know that he resides within Gotham City, a home of...

One of the two...

Millionaire or Billionaire Playboy...

They live.

Bruce Wayne.

What?

I've never heard of him.

You've never heard of Bruce Wayne?

I mean, his billboards are all over the city.

I've seen so many Bruce Wayne billboards in Gotham.

I always thought it was for Wayne's worlds.

So you do live in Gotham?

I'm not going to give my address, but...

But you don't commute.

Wait, let me guess.

I have many of you.

You don't live in...

I've been...

Blue Haven.

No, I don't.

I just south of Metropolis.

Let me guess your address.

Is it one bat cave way?

You can't do it.

Where is she?

Who?

Rachel Dawes or Vickie Vale?

We don't know.

Any woman.

Any woman?

Nancy Odell?

Nancy.

Where is Nancy Odell?

She's out of furniture shopping, I think.

She is.

Look, you're here to save the world or a woman.

I don't know what is...

How am I here?

To save Nancy Odell from the Rico Act.

I don't...

I don't think that she's really involved with the really intense crime organization.

You don't need to think anymore for Batman in this year.

Can I ask you, Batman, what does the real intense crime organization act do?

Sorry, I can't hear you over this music once.

Can you say that?

Can you ask that again?

Sure, absolutely.

The real intense crime organization act.

Rico Act.

What does it do?

It's like a mnemonic device that helps you know that R-I-C-O stands for those words.

Right.

Okay, so the act of remembering what Rico stands for, that's what the Rico Act is.

Is that what you were asking?

Absolutely.

Fantastic.

Aston Ants, thank you very much, Batman.

So, who me?

Yeah, you...

Do you not...

Oh, wait.

I'm Batman.

Yeah, you don't remember your own name sometimes.

Do you have a different name or something that you go by?

Hey, I'm sharp as a tack.

I'm a detective, first and foremost.

Oh, detective.

I don't have superpowers.

Correct.

They're all the best two detectives.

Top three detectives.

Batman and...

Monk.

What about Mort the Kai?

Wait, who's number three?

Columbus.

Columbus?

Wait, Christopher Columbus?

Christopher Columbus.

Well, I guess he found this great old USA.

Wait a minute, he had that weird eye.

Man.

What about poor O?

Poor O, a fellow.

Poor O fellow.

Poor O, he was a detective.

He was...

He figured out his wife was cheating on him.

He had that evil friend, that bird.

I would have thought he would have hired Jules Grohl for that.

That bird.

Billy Drago.

That sounded like Gilbert Godfrey.

Let me ask you a question.

You talk about...

You talk about Monk and he's this great detective.

He's just as good as you.

The great Monk detective.

Are you...

Monk?

Are you?

I wish I was.

Why do you wish you were Monk?

Tony Shaloop.

Killed my parents.

What?

This is a scoop.

Tony Shaloop killed Batman's parents.

We were at an opera.

And we came out after the opera.

And Tony Shaloop was standing there.

And he was an opera at Oprah's house.

And there's an opera at Oprah's house.

Up in Montecito?

Up in Up, Up, Up, Up, Up, up in Montecito.

And we were exited.

We were laughing.

Sure, it was a funny opera.

It was a hilarious opera.

They have a happy ending.

Like most operas do.

They have a great...

Big, big puppet.

Dance number at the end.

Puppets.

Yeah, there were puppets.

Who was operating these puppets?

The singers.

The singers were.

And it wasn't a separate crew for the puppets.

No, no.

Not like gentlemen in Blacks, no.

Right, so there's puppets and then the...

So the singers...

The opera was a whole other story.

Yes, I could tell you about that for dinner.

Yeah, tell...

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Let's talk about it.

Really interesting.

It's called a funny thing happened on the way to the opera.

What was that?

What happened on the way?

You're not gonna believe.

Because it sounds like a terrible thing happened on the way out of the opera.

They forgot the piano.

It's a big component of the opera.

Every opera needs a piano.

Pardon me while I drink some water.

Of course.

This is your real voice, obviously.

Why wouldn't it be?

So on the way to the opera they forgot a piano.

And on the way out...

Did you get scared?

It's terrifying to think of an opera without a piano.

Correct.

No, p-p-p-p-piano.

Tony Shalub was standing there or...?

Tony Shalub.

Now he was also in attendance.

He was standing there.

He was levitating three feet off the ground.

What?!

How?

With his powers.

Have you got powers?

Have you got shalub powers?

Yes, shalub powers.

I didn't realize Monk had powers.

I thought that he had limited, you know, like, viability.

Well, now that's Monk the character.

But maybe Tony Shalub has powers that Monk has not have.

He was not an abundantly clear.

He said, I am Tony Shalub, currently not Monk.

He was not wearing a dress shirt but all the way up with no tie.

No.

What was he wearing?

You're not going to believe this.

Oh, really?

A Batman costume.

He was wearing a Batman costume?

So wait a minute.

Was there a cheap?

It was a Ricky's number.

What year is this?

1961.

So this was...

I'm not sponsored.

I might be wrong.

This is a while ago then.

This is so wide.

It might have been like 23 years ago.

Okay.

23 years ago?

1961.

I feel like Tony Shalub.

I'm not sure of his exact age but he would have been like a young boy.

Yeah, I'm not terribly good at math.

So wait, if it was 23 years ago, it would have been 1995 or so.

Ooh, Batman word for it.

What if you use your powers of deductive reasoning and detective skills to deduce how long ago it was?

All right.

Alfred.

How long ago was it?

Who?

Alfred.

My name's...

Cal.

Yeah, my name's...

Do you think it's what?

For Calfred?

Is it not?

It should be.

Or calcified?

It's not.

It's not short for calcified.

It's not short.

Okay.

A California case.

Hey, do the red one tell you members sing about you or you ever...

A member of the red one tell you.

Is that song about you?

My full name is California case and song.

It is.

We've never discussed this.

I've never asked.

Alfred, you've never asked.

You are Califoc indications, all of them.

It is true.

And that is why I'm here.

Why, Batman?

To stop you.

From doing what?

You're part in the RICO Act.

Why?

You're joining the RICO Act?

No, no, Scott, you got it.

They're main campaigns.

They're songs that they play.

You know.

When they recruit members?

At the RICO Act rallies.

Oh, no.

Is Califocication by the Red Hot Chili Peppers?

Is it possible that a song that was written as a tribute to me by...

You're good friends and neighborhood kids.

Some neighborhood boys?

I thought you lived in New York.

I do, but they were in my neighborhood once.

They're passing through.

That's right.

They were in a class trip.

You know, they all went to school together.

Oh, right.

Were they off to see the Lakers play at Madison Square Garden?

The wonderful Lakers of basketball.

To see the Lakers.

So they wrote a song about you when they were based on a class trip when they were in high school.

Yeah.

And they passed through your neighborhood on the way to Madison Square Garden.

They had a dream of me.

A dream of...

Oh, yes.

They were dreaming of California- They made a dream of Califocication, right?

Really.

So you're here to stop him, though.

Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, badminton.

I'm here to stop all evil.

I'm not a crime guy.

I'm not evil.

You see my very nice man.

You don't even like cursing.

I don't.

Do you look...

What about the word?

What about the word anus?

I mean...

It's a medical term.

It's unpleasant, but sometimes you have to say it.

But I think calling someone that is rude.

When do you have to say it?

You have to say, like, doctor, there's a problem with my anus.

How often are you saying this?

Well, you know, I'm no spring chicken, so I go to the doctor for yearly checkups.

Sure.

You know, there's a lot of times, you know, when you get older, you have to attend to certain areas that you didn't have to...

So once a year you have to tell your doctor you have a problem with your anus?

Well, you know, it's more like I say, do I have a problem with my anus?

And what does he say?

Well, he puts a camera up there and then usually he says, no, everything's fine.

Like his iPhone?

Does he remove it?

Ooh, I'm assuming he does.

Because if we could get some real-time pictures, that would really help out Batman's investigation.

I'm usually asleep when it happens.

I need evidence to figure out investigations.

Well I mean, you can go to my YouTube channel.

It's all Michael and I'll just come back.

Nice and proud.

Well thank you.

It's nice.

So it's you.

Yes.

So it's you.

That's me.

Number three.

There you go.

Of course this episode famously caused Broadway actress Tatiana Moslinny.

Talks about earlier in the counter.

To break in live theater.

In the middle of her doing the Broadway show Network, there is a section and she talks about it on the Chasmin family episode where she goes outside onto whatever street her theater was on and you can see the public passing by behind her.

She's doing a live remote and someone as Batman walked by, right?

I don't think you even saw that person on camera.

I think she just saw the line of vision.

It was in her line of vision and she started laughing.

She started laughing remembering this episode and it popped in her head.

And she started laughing in the middle of the Broadway show.

Yeah.

And had to kiss Tony Goldwyn and was laughing during his mouth while she was kissing.

And this by the way, this is we've talked about on previous best of countdowns that sometimes the earlier the episode is in the eligibility period, the more people don't remember it.

And these two episodes are practically the earliest you can be in the eligibility episode, the holiday episode and right off the batman and they're very high on the countdown.

So what does that mean?

I think maybe putting the descriptions in has helped and or just these are undeniably great episodes.

Who knows?

Stone Cold Classics.

Well, look, we have two Stone Cold classics to go.

Stone Cold Steve Classics.

Stone Cold Steve Austin is on the episodes coming up on the top.

No, we have the top two episodes coming up after this.

Paul, do you even want to guess?

I don't even want you to guess.

I can't guess.

All right.

We're going to come right back.

We'll be right back with episode number two after this.

Comedy Bang Bang.

January 2020.

Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao.

Did you know those commercials?

No, I don't.

What is it?

It was for Purita Cat Food, Cat Ciao.

And they took the song calendar girl.

How does that go?

February, you're my blah, blah, blah.

March.

You're my blah, blah, blah.

April.

You're also my blah, blah, blah, blah.

May.

Guess what?

Blah, blah, blah.

But then there's June.

But then they took that song.

The curious clump.

And they made it calendar cat.

Okay.

And so the lyrics were January.

Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao.

Instead of the word.

Yeah.

I'm like, this doesn't make sense now.

It was different cats, different beautiful cats.

Beautiful.

They're like legitimately pretty.

Like you look at them like you look at a human and you say, oh, that's for me.

By the way, cats, the movie.

Oh, that's Dave.

Everyone of us.

Are you going to go see it?

Are we going to see it together?

We'll see it together.

Let's see it together.

I want to see it.

It looks just.

All right.

It looks bonkers.

Yes.

So in a, and as a press time, it is not out yet.

So we have to see it together.

I'm hoping that you have some time.

Dude, I'm hoping you have some time at the end of this week or next week.

Yeah, but I do.

Now listen, Scott, I just want to point out this is the most in all of our time knowing each other that I've heard say the phrase at press time.

I know.

Oh, you know.

Yes.

I say you're aware of it.

I started saying it and now I say it.

It's the thing.

It's part of your life.

Do you think you say it's who I am now?

Okay.

Look, look, I love you no matter what.

Okay.

Thank you.

I love you.

Is it bothering you?

I love you.

But I love love you.

I love you.

You know, I love you.

You know, I just, you know, it's not, it doesn't bother me.

I'm just, I'm just realizing you said it more than I've ever heard you say.

Well, I think this is the most I ever talk of.

I have to frame this as in things haven't happened.

Otherwise, people will be confused.

I would say the decades we've known each other are probably heard to say it press time, maybe four times before a day.

And this is five.

Yeah.

So this is the most.

Yeah.

Great.

Um, um, um, we are almost at the end of this.

Does that excite you both?

I get excited.

I know that you've been trying to hide it.

How have you been successful?

I just can't.

I get it.

I got it.

I'm about to lose control, but although that you must like a negative, you must hate that.

I think if I'm honest with myself, I like it.

Hey, Mikey.

What happened on the point?

Your sisters.

Well, I was, I have a friend who lived in their old house and a house together.

All of them.

I think so or a few of them together and, and apparently, and this is an allegedly situation.

Uh, apparently in the basement, uh, it was a crack den and there was a lot of paraphernalia down there.

Otherwise, a nice house, otherwise beautiful.

Yeah.

And like legitimately beautiful, like a gorgeous house.

I use all this as you'd be like, I wish you were a person.

Oh, I love being inside you.

Imagine if you're a person, I was like that.

It'll be sex.

Do you think sex to a house is people going into the house?

Yeah, I guess.

Cause a house can't have sex with a different house.

Sex.

Otherwise, it's an apartment.

Sex to a house.

Who let us sex to a house.

Cause if two houses were together and inside each other, they'd be an apartment building.

So houses need to have sex by people being inside them.

Maybe it's furniture with furniture.

True.

Well, no, furniture is the butt plug of house.

Sure.

It's the gerbil.

The rust.

Do it.

Nobody.

No, please.

Richard Gere.

I've heard nobody.

Nobody ever really did that, right?

No, of course not.

Stuck alive gerbil in their rectum.

No, and I, and this, the recent rash of gerbil, gerbil disappearances has nothing to do.

There's been an R.R. of G.D.s?

Yeah, it has nothing to do with me.

That's, Scott, I never said that it did.

Okay, I just want to make it very clear.

It's very strange.

I mean, there has been this recent rash of gerbil disappearances.

Yeah, we've all been talking about it.

A lot of people like, what is this, the leftovers, but gerbils?

That would be awesome.

What if just pets got wrapped?

I got to get to Netflix across the street.

Guys.

Guys, what if you go over there and they're like, we were just about to put the OA back on the leftovers, but for gerbils.

Away.

Get out of here.

Top break away.

A better idea.

Just came along.

Flip.

All right.

We have to get to it.

This is your number two.

Number two.

All right.

Number two.

What could it be?

This is episode 588 from February 25.

It's not part of the curious clump.

Definitely not part of that curious clump.

Clump is becoming less curious.

It really is.

That's as more or more.

Curiosity comes to the clump.

Oh, mama clump.

Mama clump.

She's dead.

Her colleagues.

All right.

Number two.

Number two is an episode entitled Lil Choices.

Mm.

It sounds familiar.

Sounds familiar because you might have listened to it.

He wrote it.

No, this is an episode with Jason Menzukas and Thomas Middleditch and myself.

And I mentioned very early in our countdown that Thomas, when he was on the show recently, was campaigning for this to be voted upon.

Who knows if it affected its ranking?

Only ranking Roger knows.

He took that secret of into the grave.

He certainly did.

But it is up there.

It is number two.

Wow.

Yeah.

Screw you, Lil gets the grease.

It certainly does.

And it certainly did.

And this is...

But this is a really fun episode.

I really enjoyed doing this one.

And perhaps one of the hardest laughs I've had doing this show.

And Jason Menzukas and I and Thomas, we all laughed maybe harder than we have in a long time on this.

I'll try it right here.

Not everything has to be about you.

Well, apparently it's not.

Apparently nothing is.

Nothing.

Nothing good.

We just played your episode.

Oh, good.

Didn't make you laugh harder than you.

So this episode, Thomas came on and he's doing a voice of a YouTuber, a 7th-year-old.

17-year-old girl named Caitlyn who comes on to talk about her YouTube channel.

Now what you need to know, what's happened before this clip or these clips, we're going to play a certain cross-section of it, is Caitlyn, right before this, has talked about her most popular YouTube video, which is her burning her friend Trish's hair off with chemicals that she has obtained with the help of her science teacher.

And her science teacher has taken Caitlyn out to his car in the teacher's parking lot and opened up his trunk and he has stolen a bunch of chemicals from the lab and is basically has a bunch of nitrous and a bunch of chemicals and gives Caitlyn these chemicals and has helped her do this experiment.

And that was her, that was her most popular video.

Now obviously this is an improv show and Thomas had no idea what we were going to talk about.

So we then get into talking about her second most popular video, which is far more interesting.

And you're going to hear about that.

So this is it.

This is your number two.

Let's hear it.

Here we go.

Number two.

I guess like my second biggest video on my channel was when I found the portal.

The Portos, did you say you found a portos?

Porto Portugal.

Port.

You found a portos in your hometown?

No, no, like the portal.

The game portal.

I don't know what that is.

Okay.

What do you mean?

Yeah, I guess we're hearing you correctly.

Portal.

Is that what you said?

Yeah, like the, um, I was outside.

This is a video on YouTube.

Have you find the Nepal?

Yeah, you go to Caitlyn.

You go to like it's called.

Is this like when he was so fresh?

Logan, what's his name?

Found the suicide forest.

I guess kind of accept.

I didn't make fun of it.

Okay, good.

So you go to Caitlyn so fresh.

Caitlyn so fresh and you, there's a video of you finding a portal.

What's it a portal?

Like a, do you mean like a tunnel?

Well, I know it's a portal.

It's been confirmed.

Bye, boom.

Uh, Guinness Book of World Records.

Mess, uh, scientists.

Uh, no, the.

Elon Musk.

What if you were out there just confirming things?

By the way, I wouldn't believe it.

I'm Elon Musk and I confirmed that.

It's like verified on social media.

It's just got like a musk check.

That gets a 9.2 on the musk mode meter.

Yeah, no, it was by the mole man.

Oh, what's that?

No, this is interesting.

It's like a mole.

The mole man.

It's all in the video.

I mean, if you want to, like YouTube search, you go like, you should just, you should describe.

Yeah, you should.

Just for those people, because they're my people, people who don't, uh, who don't tune in to a computer, maybe they have dial up.

Okay, well, like sometimes like I will walk in the, in like the, like path that's kind of near my house.

You know what I'm doing?

This is in Ohio.

Yeah, I'm doing my sky reviews and just to like get away from like my parents or whatever and just like talk to the camera.

So you're talking about sometimes you leave the house and you walk down a path.

Yeah, I walk down a path.

Just like, is it a, is it a kind of a rural area that you live in a little bit?

Yeah, it's like between some farm.

And the reason you do this is sometimes you want to get away from your parents.

Yeah.

And I want to record on my little, on my videos.

So you described leaving the house and walking down a path and the reasons why you do it.

Great.

Now continue.

Yeah.

I think the only outstanding elements are mole man and port.

Yep.

I look, I'm on board now.

Your motivation rings true to me.

Yeah.

You want to get away from your parents?

You've made the individual universal because we all understand that impulse.

Oh, that feels like I wanted to get away from our parents and walking down a path.

And feeling like looking at the sky gives you a little bit of scope and perspective on the life that you're living.

And now mole man.

Well, and portal.

I saw this rock, this big rock that I thought I might get on top of, right?

To get like a better clear view of the sky.

Was this rock new to you or?

I haven't seen it a lot.

Like I think you've seen it a lot.

I never thought much of it.

Yeah.

And I sort of.

But when the inspiration struck and you said, let me climb that rock.

Well, because there's some trees like blocking the view of the sky, like in the like, it was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.

And I just wanted to get a little bit more elevation, I guess.

Sure.

And then as soon as I stepped on the rock, I slipped and then went on the other side of the rock and fell down a large hole.

And I slipped and slid, slipped and slid.

And it was like this whole tunnel system and it was water.

It's all in the video.

But you know, in a normal waterslide, the lifeguard pushes you down and you only go down one slide.

You could go down, you sort of choose.

Well, there were multiple avenues to go down.

Was it like in Goonies?

Yeah, except as Scott was saying, like little choices.

Yeah, yeah.

How many, how were the choices presented?

There was like eight, there was eight and they're all called, they're all called little choices.

There was a little apostrophe.

Yeah, there was like these little like they were labeled.

Yeah, these little like four choices.

And so if we watch the video, which obviously almost everybody listening has.

Hopefully you'll pause this.

It has like already like four hundred million dollars.

We will see.

Yeah.

Little words pop up, little choices.

Yeah, on these little, they had these like little signs.

Sounds like a video game.

Well, they had these little signs and it's kind of like Splash Mountain, you know, or sure.

It's like a little whacky.

Like it was, it was whacky down there.

Splash Mountain though, as far as I know, they only have one precipice.

I'm like, this was Goonies meets Splash Mountain with little choices.

But where do you understand?

But where do you end up is my question?

Cause what it sounds like to me, no offense.

Yeah.

It sounds to me like you fell down a well.

No, it was like a little bit like you fell down a deep hole.

Which by the way, you described it as you tried to step on the rock.

You went through the rock to the other side of the rock and fell down a hole.

Fell down the other side.

Yeah, I fell down the other side of the rock.

Was the rock a hologram?

No, I stepped on the rock and I slipped.

Oh, you slipped on top of the rock and then I traveled down.

And then it was blocking this hole that was on the ground.

So where does the portal get?

Like when I think of a portal, I think of a portal to another dimension.

Well, I haven't even gotten to the portal.

Oh, you haven't gotten to the portal.

This is just a hole in the ground?

This is a hole in the ground.

With little choices.

Oh, I'm telling you.

So wait, I thought this was the portal.

No, so someone in our dimension labeled these little choices?

I don't know.

There were so many other choices.

And I don't know what one of the other choices led to other choices.

There could be more than eight little choices.

I just experienced eight little choices.

And you made your choice.

How did you make your choice?

Yeah, yeah.

Did you try and be morally up standing or did you make choices based on your based on your based on the rules or the errors?

Okay, I'll give you an example.

If you're an adventure, you can choose the bad thing or the bad thing.

But I don't know how you choose which port or which.

I'll give you an example.

Like at one point, and again, this is all in the video.

Like at one point, the, the, like, what am I trying to say?

Like the tunnel, the shoot, like leveled out.

So you sort of came to a stop and it's like wet.

You know, it's like.

It is wet.

The wet tunnel that you're shooting for.

Yeah.

So the water is helping you propel your journey.

So it sounds a lot like a water slide.

Yeah.

And then you sort of, you sort of slide out, you stop.

And then there's two, then there's two little tunnels that branch off and this says a little choice.

And then there's a little choice.

A little choice.

Yeah.

And then there's like a, like a TV and it played the last scene of what's that Elijah, the good son.

Okay.

And when she's on the cliff and she's got the two boys, like holding the boys before they fall.

It played the last scene of the good son.

Yeah.

And it cut before she made the choice.

Oh.

And you're just supposed to say, Colkin or what?

Okay.

Colkin or if you, and you say one of them.

Yeah.

You say it out loud.

Yeah.

And you knew that instinctually.

I just, I said would cause I like his eyes are so big.

So you shouted out would because on the screen, it said, it showed you this.

And then it got, because I'm like recording the whole time.

Right.

So it cuts and then on the screen, just watch the video.

I went far more.

I actually hearing about it.

So then it goes, Colkin or what?

And I just, cause I didn't really know what to do.

I said, what?

You just shouted it out.

What?

No, I was like, what?

Like that.

I was a little scared because it's like not every day that you go down a crazy tunnel with little choices and video screens.

But so in decades old movies.

Yeah. And so then like one of the tunnels kind of illuminated.

Like there was like, yeah, there was like lights down.

I was like, okay, I guess that one.

So you were supposed to propel your own self.

Yeah.

And then I scooted through that.

How long did you just scoot?

This is a flat space at this point.

Yeah.

Kind of like levels out.

And again, just to be clear, we have not yet gotten to the portal.

Got it.

Okay.

We're still in the midst of.

We're still little choices.

But many more little choices.

Yeah.

There are eight little choices.

Total.

And this.

Yeah.

At least that I experienced.

This is one.

Yeah.

I'm not going to give you all a low.

No, no, no, we are going through all the little choices.

It's on the video.

But I just want you to know though that this isn't even my most popular video.

My most popular video is the hydrochloric acid burn.

Oh, okay.

Trish is ahead.

Okay.

Great.

I'm not I'm less interested in that than in the strange man made or human made little choices.

Yeah.

They are slide.

It doesn't tell you.

Well, maybe there are some sort of visual clues that we can look at.

But anyway, so you scooted yourself to the tunnel that illuminated for Elijah would.

Yeah.

Was Elijah would inside that tunnel or?

No, I'm never met him.

I went off to.

So then do you start descending again?

Yeah.

And then there was like a whole other, you know, little choice.

Are there twists and turns or?

Yeah.

I mean, it's like really wild.

Any 360 loops or?

No, 360 loops, but at one point, it sort of stopped and then there was like an inner tube and I had to get on that.

And then there was like a wide.

One point.

You slow to a stop.

Yeah.

And then an inner tube is just laying there or it's like tied up.

It's tied up and there's like a sign that says use me.

Use me.

Oh, this is very.

Yeah.

It's Carol.

Yeah.

Anyway, I got on that and then there was like a whole other section.

You went tied it.

Yeah.

It was on the little inner tube.

Right.

It was wider.

It was a wider tunnel.

Yeah.

It was the same thing, but it was just wider.

Right.

You need an inner tube in order to traverse that safely.

Yeah.

Okay.

So then what happens then?

Seven other little choices.

And then I'm sort of with illuminating.

It was always a binary choice.

Was it this or that?

Yeah.

And they were all like movies.

They're all movies.

Oh, interesting.

Were any of them.

Like it was all the.

If I might ask, were any of them based on Sophie's choice?

Yeah.

Was there a Sophie's choice one?

I don't know.

I mean, I definitely remember like there was a Pirates of the Caribbean one where there was just Orlando Bloom and then Johnny Depp and then you'd have to say Depp or Bloom.

Depp or Bloom.

Okay.

And you remember what you chose?

I chose Bloom.

Okay.

You chose Bloom.

And do you remember what scene that was?

I don't.

I mean, I think it was at the beginning of the first one.

At the very beginning.

Oh.

When they were still at odds with each other.

Yes.

And they were like, Oh my God, you, you.

And each time this seemed to be voice activated.

I guess.

Well, actually I later found out.

Oh, you later found out.

Yeah.

Because after all the little choices, I like, I came to the bottom and it was like sort of like this dirt patch that I was just sort of spat on.

It's stuck because like I'm all wet and like.

And drugged.

Yeah.

And as dirt now it's all muddy.

Yeah.

And then there was like this.

I mean, I call it a portal.

It was like this opening in like space time where it was like swirling light.

I guess.

So it looked it was almost as if like a shimmering hole in the air.

Like a little like a little hole like a little hole or a little hole.

Like how big is the well, I know it was little hole because there was a sign called little hole.

Little hole.

Did you say it's just a little hole?

That was the only choice.

The only choice was the little hole.

So you you dived through the way did you have to jump up?

Yeah.

You got to make a choice.

You don't just shoot straight into the portal, right?

I kind of like.

You get to choose.

You d.

Yeah.

Well, how high was it off the ground because I imagine if it were even like three feet off the ground, you kind of have to jump into it and do a somersault out of it.

It was it was around three feet, but I did not have to jump.

I sort of just like climbed through.

I know.

Where did you hold onto?

Where did the edges of the portal?

So the edges of the portal were tactile.

You could hold on to those.

And hoist yourself through.

Yeah, I sort of hoist myself.

But all the whole time, I was like trying to do it like selfie style because I wanted to make sure sure you're holding the whole.

You're holding a phone this entire time.

You're just trying to figure out.

And there weren't any sort of like handrails for you.

No, no.

So I was trying to like capture because you want like it's important to capture you as well in the frame to prove that it's yeah.

So I'm like, okay, I think I said in the video, like, okay, I'm going through this little hole.

Hey, guys.

I was like, Hey, guys, I'm going through those.

This little hole now.

I guess I'm somewhere underneath the earth.

How far down do you think that you would?

This is a little choice.

We had seen like stalactites or stalagmites or like molten lava or.

Was it getting hotter?

I had to like pop my ears multiple multiple.

Oh, wow.

Yeah.

Wow.

So that's like quite deep in several hundred feet down.

I mean, I guess it's so I mean, I don't know if you've ever been through like a subterranean web of tunnels with little choices.

Eight little choices.

It's hard to tell where you are.

And then to be confronted with the little hole.

Yeah.

At that point, I was pretty confused.

I was like, Hey, guys, I'm going into this little hole.

Yeah, it's important to be positive.

Can I ask before we talk about what you saw once you went through the portal?

Yeah.

Do you think that you made eight correct choices?

Yeah.

Or do you think that you made an incorrect choice?

And that's why you were presented with a hole.

I don't know.

And I've actually like, it's so funny.

Like I've been seeing a therapist over this whole thing.

Oh, I bet.

I'm really dramatic.

Yeah, I would imagine.

I mean, I would think the first time I plunged down into the hole, my brain goes, Oh, I'm dead.

Yeah.

No, I was like initially scared.

But again, I was still like filming.

So I just, yeah, I just wanted to make it fun.

I mean, the first time I see wood or Colkin, I'm probably thinking, Oh, instead of saying what my choice is, maybe I should try to climb back up through this.

I got to get out of here.

This is dangerous.

Yeah.

No, I mean, those are all thoughts that you can like.

It's like somebody set this all up and that's chilling.

This seems to be some sort of trap for minors under 18.

Yeah.

Those are, I mean, those are all like thoughts that it's in some state.

It's pretty fun to like think about that like in hindsight, it's just in the moment, you know, you like want to go with the flow.

Okay.

Now this story and I have thought, Oh my God, what about all those other eight little choices and they have other choices there?

Sure.

Yeah.

Like Colkin and all the other choices.

Colkin depth.

Yeah.

Where would you have landed up?

Would I get still get to the portal, but under just different circumstances?

Would it send you somewhere else?

Yeah.

Or are there other little things at the end of them?

Can I ask before we get to the portal too?

This town, where are you from?

Dane, Ohio.

Right, brothers.

Has there been a recent rash of disappearances?

No more, no more than usual, like just the average.

But what is the usual to date?

Dane, Ohio, I think suffers from like six to 700 children missing a year.

I think.

And that's considered normal.

Yeah.

That's like you would date.

That's quite a lot.

Okay.

So we've gotten to the point where you somehow using the edges of the portal, which seemed to be acting as tactile guardrails for you.

You're able to...

I hoisted myself.

Hoisted yourself up into this portal.

What was that movie with like Scarlett Johansson and it's like she's like a killer or something?

Under the skin.

Have you seen that in that scene in the movie, there's like, it's like a black void.

Sure.

But when did the black void come about?

I haven't seen this film.

She lures a man.

It's a beautiful movie actually.

Yeah.

She, she, I don't know how much to reveal.

Spoilers, I guess for...

Wow, why does a void come around?

That's all we need to talk about.

She places people into a void that is like almost like black liquid almost.

Yeah.

It's like a black void, but there is some kind of like liquidy mirror.

There's like a viscosity to it where people...

Yeah.

If venom were stuck in it, you know, people are stuck in it alive.

And she kind of feeds off of them.

Yeah.

So it was...

Why do you bring this up?

Because that's kind of what I came into.

Like the portal.

You went through the portal into like a void.

Yeah.

Into a liquid.

Yeah.

Were you able to breathe?

But it just looked a lot like the under the skin scene.

And just based on like there was so much movie stuff and like Hollywood references and the eight little choices, I think it was like this is set.

I think it was like a movie fan.

Yeah.

Whoever this is a movie fan.

And I know he is because that's when the mole man appeared.

So the mole man was in this void.

No, no.

The mole man was through the portal.

Through the portal.

Right.

He came up through the liquid and he was a little bit wet, but it was like it dried off really quick.

Oh, interesting.

Are you breathing this liquid?

Yeah.

Are you able to take oxygen from the liquid?

For...

Like initially it was only a knee-deep height, but he later revealed to me that he can control the height and he like dipped me in.

Oh.

Was it dipped you in like a baptism?

No, he could like...

He would...

I like I'm jumping through the conversation.

Like this is like a two hour long video, by the way.

Like I jump...

We're jumping too far ahead at this point.

Like if I want to get to the debate.

I want to go to the conversation.

He's like, you don't believe I can.

I said, no, I don't.

I was screaming at the point.

And then he sort of like just like whooshed me through the liquid and then brought me back out.

It was like an example of his ever-growing power.

Oh, so the mole man is powerful.

At least he wanted to convey to me.

Yes.

Anyway, so he's like this like pink fleshy little man with like wearing clothes or wearing clothes.

No, he's not.

But he's kind of like a beast as well.

Like he's kind of like part mole.

Does he have hair or...

He's like a little scruffy little bits behind his ears on his chin.

What about his genitals?

Are they covered in hair?

Yeah.

Sort of like a lipstick situation?

No, there's no...

He had enough hair.

You see...

This is a naked mole man approaching a 17 year old girl.

I want to know what exactly, how he presents himself.

And he had enough hair that you couldn't see his genitals.

Like the hair was longer than the genitals, I guess.

Okay.

That was an unfortunate situation for him.

Yeah.

But you know, we've all been there.

Yeah.

Did he give you a sense of where you were?

First I was like, what is this?

He's like, we're in another dimension, we're in the nether.

The nether is what I call there.

Yeah.

So this is like the upside down in a way.

Yeah.

I guess.

Yeah.

I don't know if you've seen strange things.

Yeah, I've seen.

I've seen like a lot of stuff.

You're only a 17 year old girl.

How do you have so much time to watch?

I love watching.

I love watching culture.

I love watching it development.

Okay.

All right.

So this is the nether.

Yeah.

So he introduced himself as another dimension called the nether.

Yeah.

And then he's like, I'm super powerful.

Like I control these lands and he was the mastermind and the ruler of the net.

Yeah.

And then I was like, did you have any like, what was all those little choices about like, what's the tunnel saying?

He's like, what are you talking about?

What little choices?

He's either lying.

He's really.

He's really in the dark about it.

Or he has no idea what these are.

And then he was like, oh, how did he know to come to where you were?

Did he mention that?

Like, oh, yeah, he did.

He's like, this liquid is like a spider web for me.

I can feel when there's disturbances in it.

And all that stuff, right?

During this break, I watched the video.

I scrubbed through the video.

Yeah, it's too.

It's a long one.

You see him?

Tell him, tell me what all those choices were.

Well, here's the thing.

Here's what's interesting about the video.

You've seen it.

That were the eight little choices.

Well, here's what we explained.

Let me explain the video.

And I think you'll see what the choices are.

I'm happy to explain all of that.

So in the video, Caitlin is indeed doing a sky review.

She's walking along.

She sees the big rock.

She goes up on top of the rock.

She appears to slip and fall.

Right.

And then for like a little over an hour, the phone is still recording, but it's just pointed at Caitlin who appears to be unconscious on the ground.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

And then a homeless man.

Oh, okay.

Who is naked?

Right.

Yeah.

How long are these pubes?

Comes into frame.

His genitals are truly obscured completely.

And he wakes Caitlin up.

Caitlin has some blood on her head.

Okay.

And they do proceed to then have a conversation that is similar to the conversation that Caitlin is telling us about now.

Okay.

Although she's talking about the little choice, the little choices, she's talking about all the things that she's talking about.

And he is confused.

Right.

But I think that a lot of this might have happened during a blackout.

Maybe you were concussed.

Okay.

That's exactly what the mole man was talking about.

He said, he said, at the end, when we were wrapping up, after he like showed me, how did you, well, he had to show me like, he said, they call like the order of the marbles.

And he like showed me all these like little marbles and how they align and stuff.

Like I don't really get it.

It was like, he said it was quantum physics.

Oh, I see.

And that's something to do with how he controlled his realm.

Yeah.

And anyway, he like made a bunch of marbles alive and like, and align and like make pyramids and stuff.

Okay.

But then he was like, now before you go, in order for this to seem plausible, I'm going to have to make it seem like you dreamtet.

Oh, okay.

Right.

And then he said, so this, I can't like the, do you, by the way, what are you saying?

The occupation of the tunnels and the portal, these could not be discovered by anyone in your room.

Sure.

You said that, you said that before I let you go, is it like a thing of like, he's got other stuff to do or he's letting you go?

Well, like, are you his captive or is he like, is he like, okay, both busy?

Look, I got other shit.

I got it.

Before I let you go, I don't know.

I mean, it was a fascinating conversation, but I have a mohlman business.

Thanks for stopping by.

Well, yeah, we have like, we all have like stuff to do.

And you knew it was like probably running out of memory on my phone.

Right.

Whoa, okay.

I don't know if you caught this part in the video.

You were scrubbing through.

Because scrub through.

I do sort of, I do, you know, like, I remember everything.

And I remember at the end, waking up and there's like this homeless guy there.

At the end, I don't know if it, if it got it on tape, because again, I haven't seen it.

You just uploaded it right away.

Like people have to see this.

But the homeless man, he looked down the eyes and he winks like this.

Like, okay, I don't know how to describe that.

So that was a double blink and then you opened one eye.

Yes.

So it's a full, full link.

Into a wing.

Into a single eye opening.

And then he made a noise like, and then he said, it's me.

Oh boy.

It's me.

And what did that mean?

Do you think that he meant the mohlman or you?

Yeah.

Or the person who set up this entire adventure.

And then did you just follow the ribbon back to your house?

Or you knew the way back.

He carried me.

And then when my parents were like, what is this naked door?

They're like, Caitlin, where have you been?

How long have you been gone?

This is an interesting question.

I don't know.

I mean, it felt like, it felt like forever.

But along was it in real time?

I think it was like 20, 25 minutes.

Oh, okay.

But here's the thing.

Here's what's weird.

The video is three hours long.

Okay.

Yeah.

Because the video is very long.

But it was really 25 minutes.

Yeah.

But they were worried sick.

And they were so grateful for the man to bring you home.

You were gone 25 minutes.

Why were they worried sick?

Well, Dayton now has like got a pretty intense child.

Plus it doesn't sound like you get out of your house too much.

You needed an excuse of why you're walking along this trail.

Yeah.

And I remember this.

Just as he was leaving, like the homeless man, like he returned me to my parents.

Yeah.

Did he leave you on the doorstep and ring the bell?

Yeah.

Well, no, he's naked.

He was holding me in his arms and he knocked on the door and like the door up and there are my parents.

And I'm like, Oh my God, Caitlin, you're here.

Thank you.

Thank you, sir.

Thank you for returning here.

And he was like, Oh, not a big deal.

I said, and he did.

Do you have any pants?

Yeah.

And then, and they were like, what do we call you?

And like, what's your name?

What do we call you?

I was strange that your parents would phrase it like that.

What do we call?

They're just not a Denmark.

They're not phased about the nakedness.

They're from Denmark, which is why they're not phased by the nakedness.

Okay.

So what do we call you?

And then he said, just call me M. M.

M M. So like Marshall Mathers?

No, down to M.

Oh, you think he's the mole man.

No, dad.

I am concerned for Trisha's safety.

Trisha's fine.

And I'm also honestly a little concerned with your relationship with your science teacher.

Maybe you should try to lure your science teacher into this.

Ooh, now this is interesting.

He should make some little choices.

Yeah, he's made a bunch of bad news choices.

What's so crazy about having a like a relationship with Mr.

Manfield?

A relates.

When you say relationship, what do you mean?

Mr. M, he's chill.

Wait, Mr. M.

Yeah, Mr. Manfield.

M and M.

Oh, Mr. Manfield.

Mr. M.

Manfield.

You don't think that he's...

Well, now this is interesting.

I don't did this.

This just got interesting.

Did somehow his car full of chemicals and...

He's just a science teacher.

Okay.

He's just a science teacher that if you do get in class, he gives you a little like ribbon, a little bow.

Oh, if you do get in class.

He gives you like a little pink ribbon?

Yeah, like a little pink ribbon and a little upward.

Has there a reward for just getting to class?

No, if you do well in class.

Oh, if you do well.

If you do a good test on it, like well on it.

If you give you a little paper.

If you get an air above on it, he'll step a little ribbon.

So can I ask you something where you mentioned ribbons earlier?

I hate to jog your memory.

Oh, yeah.

And it seems as if you have a relationship with Mr. Manfield.

Uh-huh.

M-M-M.

Do you think that he's the one who lured you?

And it seems like he has access to hundreds of children a year.

What are you saying?

Do you think he is the- Is it possible?

Is it possible?

Is the mastermind.

Oh, M-M, mastermind.

Behind this very complicated, Rube Goldberg-like series of tunnels that seem to be some sort of test upon a child's very soul?

Yeah, he would understand probably the choices that kids would make and also might have the understanding of how to dig elaborate tunnel systems without causing structural damage.

Yeah, I mean using chemicals, just pouring them on the ground.

Of course.

Also, can I ask you, did he ever ask you about your opinions on several movies, like the Good Sun or anything?

I mean, yeah, we talked movies all the time.

Did he ever show movies in class?

Yeah, only when there wasn't that many experiments to do.

Pirates of the Caribbean?

Yeah.

Good Sun?

Yeah.

M-M-M.

What's that Kevin Costner one?

Kevin is quite fun.

Yeah.

What about piano in the puppies?

Yeah, he did show me that actually.

Yeah.

All right.

You know what?

I'm starting to formulate a pretty clear opinion about what's going on.

Yeah.

Also, does he have hair all over his body?

I'm not sure.

Not that that's a bad thing.

No, of course.

Not that that's at all any kind of bad thing.

I'm not sure.

I mean, he's got a normal amount of hair on his forearms.

Okay.

You know, the homeless gentleman who saved you and rescued you.

When he brought you to your parents' house in his arms, when they opened the door, what did they say to him?

Oh, hey, Mr. M.

It's okay.

All right.

I don't know quite what.

I don't know what to think about this story now.

This is like the usual suspect.

We're going back over everything you've told us and wondering what's true.

It's not true.

So they, your parents call him Mr. M.

All right.

Yeah, but then, oh, like what did they say?

Look, we're not going to figure this out today, but I do need to make a call to Child Protective Services, I think, in Dayton, Ohio.

Oh my God.

Number two.

What do you got?

What do you mean what I got?

Is it an email or the time?

I got, no, it was a text message.

Why would it look that long for the time?

Scott, I know numbers.

What are they?

Whoa.

Yeah.

I thought so.

What are you going to say?

Fish?

Not now.

That was number two.

Number two.

Yeah, a very fun episode.

Just obviously we go insane at the end.

Silly fun with insanity.

Silly fun, Thomas, of course, from Silicon Valley, which just ended.

I enjoyed the ending.

I thought they did a good job.

As they say, they stuck the landing.

Good for them.

Good for them and good for us because we got to watch it.

Okay, look, I got to be honest with you.

We take a break.

We're going to hear the number one episode voted on by the public.

I appreciate your candor.

I appreciate the bottle city of candor.

Where's my spasalix?

Aren't you?

I'm a real brainiac in that I'm green.

And you're stolen a bunch of shrunken cities.

Yeah.

All right, let's take a break.

When we come back, we'll have your number one.

Here it is.

Time to get it done.

We're counting all the way down to number that is one.

Yes, that's right.

We are back.

And Paul, we're here at the number one episode.

I'm sure by process or process of elimination, people have their opinions about what the number one episode is.

I have so many of mine.

You do.

I wonder if you are right.

Oh, I bet I am.

Do you want to whisper it to me?

Yes.

Okay.

That was a bit of a...

Well, we'll see.

Won't we, my dear boy.

I better be right.

Oh, shit.

You fucking laugh at me like that.

All right, well, let's get to it.

This is voted on by you, the fans.

This is your number one.

Number one.

All right.

Here it is.

You're going to be very happy to hear.

Give me all the usual clues to give.

This is, of course, episode number 616, the number of the Marvel universe.

What?

It's Earth 616.

What?

Is that true?

Alan Moore is the person who established that.

So yes.

And everyone went along with it?

Everyone went along with it.

Earth number 616.

All right.

Out of how many?

Million, endless number.

This is not the new 52 where it's 52 worth and that's it.

This is...

Is that what the new 52 meant?

Yes.

That was DC, wasn't it?

That's DC.

They had 52 earths in the multiverse.

Which one of them was a bitch?

So in any case, this is 616 and this, you're going to be very happy to hear this Paul.

This is from August 26th.

Oh, it's my favorite month for things to be from.

Now this, I feel, is part of the Curious Club.

That's why you're excited.

This is part of that Curious Club and we'll get some...

Curious Club Theory still stands.

We'll be getting to that a little later.

But this is an episode called Memphis, Kansas, Breeze, with...

I think I'm a bitch, what was this?

Yacht.

It's the one that Memphis, Kansas, Breeze is on.

Yes!

Yacht's queen.

This is an episode with the band Yacht, Jonna and Claire.

And we also have Sean Diston.

We've talked about quite a bit and we have Carl Tarte and Drew Tarver.

All people that we've talked about previously on.

That's right.

The best ofs other than Yacht.

We haven't talked about them.

But Yacht, they're nice people.

They came in and played some songs off of their new record.

And then Sean Diston came on.

We're not going to be hearing a clip from him because we heard mainly some Rudy North on a previous clip.

But he was playing an archaeologist, little Tony Diamonds.

But the reason why people voted for this episode, clearly this is one of the biggest fan favorites in recent history of comedy bang bang.

Carl Tarte and Drew Tarver came in playing their country band Memphis, Kansas Breeze.

And just blew us all away and immediately people said, you know, this is one of their favorite episodes.

And...

People are thrilled by this.

Thrilled by this.

It's hilarious.

It's so funny.

And Brad and Nick, who we talked to in the last best ofs, they wrote the songs for these guys.

And so look, why don't we just hear the clip?

I consider talking about it, but let's talk about it more afterwards.

I have no reasons not to.

So let's do it.

Let's do it.

This is your number one.

Number one.

Please welcome to the show.

Their individual names are Brantley Aldean and Harlan Haywood.

This is Memphis, Kansas Breeze.

Hi, everyone.

Hi, how you doing?

How you doing?

Nice for coming over to our genre or having our genre.

I appreciate it.

Yeah.

Well, what do they call those graphs that have the circles that you know what I'm talking about?

Yeah.

Ben Diagram.

Ben Diagram's a good pull.

I was going to say pie chart.

I was going to say aptitude test.

Well, you know, country's been hot and healthy, though.

Yeah.

You know what?

Our name is Memphis, Kansas Breeze.

Yeah.

I guess it's cooling down the hotness of country in a way.

Yeah, it is a little bit.

Yeah, yeah.

Kind of crossing over.

You never worry that Breeze is going to cool you down to where you no longer have any career or?

Yeah.

Sometimes if it turned up to a wind, we would be maybe a little worried.

Right.

But it's just a simple breeze.

You know, you could stand.

I mean, we get, you know, a little bit popular sometimes.

Okay, if a breeze comes, you know, we're the number one band for Southern guys that watch Step Mom porn.

Yeah.

Okay.

It's a very popular genre.

Yeah.

Very specific, but huge.

Yeah.

You ever sit in your house and you're underwear and you got two windows open on two different sizes of room.

Yeah.

Get that cross breeze going.

Just get low.

Yeah.

You know that just right over the top and you're like, well, that feels good.

And then it's as fleeting as it was pleasurable.

Yeah.

That's a breeze.

And you're not that exactly.

You're not that is canvas Memphis.

Breathe Memphis.

Can this be okay?

What is that?

Are you from two different places?

We are.

Yeah.

He is from you say that like it's the first time you're learning this surely that winning to the day.

No, no, no, no, no, no, that was that is it been pre decided.

He is from Georgia and I and from Alabama.

Yeah.

Okay.

What does Memphis, Kansas have to do with a, there is not a Memphis Kansas is there?

There's a Memphis, Tennessee, there's a Kansas, the state, Kansas, the state.

Yeah, we just like how those rolled together.

Yeah.

And we like barbecue and there's Memphis style barbecue and there is the whole state of Kansas style barbecue.

Yeah.

Right.

Kansas City barbecue is very popular.

Yeah.

You took those three words that you're very interested in two of them barbecue related and one of them, a weather related weather and you came up with your name.

Yeah.

We were going to be called dry rub cloud for a minute there.

We were trying out different names.

Yeah.

But like I came up with that one.

What kind of it did kind of I was listening to you all say that and it reminded me of see what it happened.

I was building a computer in my house and I got shot.

You were.

Yeah.

You were building a computer from scratch.

Because I'm not going to go buy one from some store.

No, we got parts laying around.

Yeah.

And pulled a motor out of a 1988 Delta 88 and uh, okay.

We put it inside of a Toyota Camry.

Yeah.

Shassy.

Yeah.

Sure.

That sounds like why why can't we get to the internet on this thing?

That's like a circuit.

Damn internet wouldn't work.

So I just figured it was just wrong car.

We put it in Toyota Camry.

We said it probably did a hundred car.

Sure.

Yeah.

I got shot real bad and uh, I was like, I am a computer.

Yeah.

So you thought you were a computer?

Yeah.

I mean, he came too.

I took him to the Apple store.

I dropped him on the Genius bar.

Exactly.

Like, can you fix it?

I said, my friend, he ain't they're like, he needs to go to the hospital.

And they took me in the back and told me I was waterlogged.

Oh, I see.

So they wasn't going to cover it.

Yeah.

I wasn't going to cover it.

So I'm scared didn't cover it.

Yeah.

But we're here to you know, we're here to promote our new album.

We're going to do some new songs from you.

How many albums do you have?

This is a new one.

How many do you have in your decision?

Oh, this is your first one.

This is our first new album.

It's very new.

Yeah.

It's your first new album.

And at some point it will be your first old album.

That is true.

Yeah.

But this is new and it is for our first album.

It's called Small Town, Good Times with Family and Friends.

And also it's a Saturday.

Yeah.

We write songs about the three things that make life worth living.

Okay.

Let's run them down.

What do we got?

Beer.

We got some of the books.

Okay.

I love all those things.

Go in and hit it for us.

Here we go.

Yeah.

All right, Harley.

All right, Bradley.

Give me an all right.

Saturday night time to have some fun.

Going to drink some beers.

Going to shoot my gun.

Then I notice the date's 2.23 and that's a birth date of someone special.

Go to me.

So I got some candles and I got some cake.

And I told everyone to meet me by the lake.

I got my truck 4 years ago today and that makes this the trucks birthday.

Pick a truck birthday party.

Everyone's invited.

The trucks hunk their horns and they get excited.

Pick a truck birthday party having a blast.

I got it my birthday cake made again.

Instead a party has the trucks wear traffic cones and instead of birthday clowns they hire a mechanic.

Staying and happy birthday trucks hunk their horns.

Some do car alarms but most hunk horns.

Hunk hunk trucks birthday.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

We stopped that one quick.

Yeah, you're so amazing.

You seem surprised by how good it is.

No, no, no, that was that's bad plan.

Our band stops.

We had a dime.

Our band is very through that instrument on the ground.

Yeah, yeah.

Stomp ton.

They immediately threw that thing out.

You guys use those later guys.

Truly beautiful harmonies.

I got a name.

Thank you so much.

We really come in with those harmonies.

That one is called truck trucks birthday.

Yeah, it's called pick up truck birthday party.

Yeah.

And you seem in disagreement about what it's called.

Well, I thought we are calling it pick up truck birthday party.

Okay.

Why you calling it per ethnicities trucks birthday?

Yeah.

Okay.

And in the lyrics, the cake is made of gas.

That's true.

You know what I had trucked.

Well, you know, you put gas in the freezer.

It becomes gelatinous.

We can tell it.

Did you know that you put gas in the freezer?

It becomes gelatinous.

You can't just repeat what he says.

Like, do you know it?

He knew that.

I know you know it.

We talked about it.

I don't know if you know it.

I just knew that.

I see him.

How old is y'all truck?

Make you pardon?

How old is y'all truck, right?

Oh, 1989.

Yes, you have a laser.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

Yeah.

Big three.

Oh, huh?

Big three.

What do you celebrate the trucks creation day or the day that you bought it?

Well, you celebrate the day that we bought it.

So that's four years ago.

But when we bought it, it was 20 years ago.

A truck is not a truck is not a truck at conception.

Imitures.

No.

Yes.

When you had it.

Fun fact, Scott, for you.

Scott and Yacht, that song right there has won every award at the CMA's for the past three years.

Congratulations.

Thank you very much.

We're not even out there.

We were the only people at the podium.

That's the thing.

I think like sometimes the Oscars come out and there's no good movies that year.

Yeah.

Just go back to the previous year and give one, you know, to the runner up.

Pull them back up on stage.

Pull them back.

If I can't.

Yeah, we didn't get a hill situation, you know.

I don't know what that means.

You've the game king of the hill, like you fight on the bottom of the hill.

The shell.

Okay, because there's a movie king of the hill, there's a TV show king of the hill.

It is a child game where you stand on an actual hill.

Okay.

And you are king of the hill till somebody can push you off.

Okay.

So just every year the Oscars or the CMA's just goes like, well, nothing better came along.

Exactly.

Yeah, we barely even left the stage.

We keep walking down the stairs, but there we go again.

We turn around, we go back up there.

Takes you a long time to get back up there, huh?

It does.

Yeah.

I got a bad knee.

Okay.

And I am a computer.

You still take your computer.

Y'all can't tell.

Did you know if you put gas in the freezer, it becomes gelatinous.

Yeah.

I believe I heard that around the same time that you heard it.

Oh, I don't know.

I knew that.

Let's go ahead and sing another one for us.

You got another one for us?

Let's go ahead and do one more.

Go ahead and hit it, man.

Oh, just one more.

Two.

Oh, yeah.

Harlan.

Oh, yeah.

Brand leaf.

You got time to give me one?

Oh, yeah.

It's a great one.

Oh, yeah, Scott?

Nope.

All right.

There once was a girl truck who didn't get invited to the truck school dance.

No one asked her.

She had to stay at home alone crying tears made a gas.

The most popular truck in school invited her to the prom as a joke.

All the jock trucks were going to look at her and laugh at her ex-pants.

But then the boy truck took off the girl truck's glasses and realized just how pretty she was.

He learned that you can't judge a truck based solely on its appearance.

Because it's once inside the truck that matters the most.

They got to open up the hood to see what kind of engines inside.

Then they both got elected king and queen of the truck prom dance.

Truck prom dance.

Truck truck prom dance.

To be me honk.

To be me honk me.

To be me.

To be me honk me honk me.

Yeah.

Oh my god.

Some break those intramas then they throw them down.

Yeah, they threw them down.

Dumped them in a truck.

And what was that one called?

That one right there was called.

It has an obvious title.

I'm wondering if you agree on it.

That was called truck prom dance.

For parentheses, girl invited to the truck prom dance.

Long for it.

I created these titles.

For instance, just like y'all had booty games.

The whole title is in the parentheses.

That's a little bit of my doing as I'm AI.

Right.

Alan Iverson.

And how popular is that one?

As popular as the other one or not as popular?

Dead tie.

Dead he.

Really?

You did.

You can't.

Neck and neck.

Really?

So wins the exact same award?

Photo finish.

Windham songs.

And before you guys even say it.

I know what y'all thinking.

We know what y'all thinking.

That was not directly taken from the plot of the movie She's All That.

Yeah.

It seemed very similar.

The Rachel Cook film, Freddie Prinze Jr. is he in that?

I can't remember.

We don't know what she's all that is.

All right.

That's a real thing that happened to an actual truck.

Yeah.

Wow.

I don't realize that trucks make people so emotional.

Yeah.

I mean, tears in your eyes.

It's a real thing we saw.

We used to be substitute teachers at a high school.

Yeah.

You would think that trucks are the students and the trucks would be the teachers.

But Truman's students and humans are the teachers.

And is this school before they get sold to the owners?

So they're made at the factories and then they go through school?

Yeah.

I told you.

We bought our truck.

It was 26 years old.

I told you, college, got a master's degree in social sciences.

So graduate school?

Oh my god.

Yeah.

So do you guys have another song?

We do.

Yeah.

We got one last one.

This is the last one.

I couldn't.

This is the last one.

Could get you to do two more?

No.

We're trying to leave it up to the imagination.

What the next one will be.

All right.

So let's go ahead and hit that.

All right.

Brantley.

Oh.

Right.

Harlan.

I came home from work to see my wife crying on the couch.

My wife is a truck and when she cries she honks.

Oh.

The truck wife said, honey, I'm pregnant.

So I held her by her side mirror, which is her hand and then I gazed into her when she yelled eyes.

I said, I'll be proud to be the dad of your truck, baby.

Then the truck gave birth right then and there.

Out of her tailpipe, which is her pussy, squirting out the tailpipe.

What did I see?

A little baby truck that looks sorta like me.

It was a full-sized truck covered in human skin.

It started screaming in a human voice.

It said, please kill me.

I'm constantly in pain.

Why do I exist?

Please, in my life I said, no, you're my son.

And I'm proud to be the father to this human skin truck, baby.

Human skin truck, baby.

Skin truck, skin truck.

Human skin truck, baby.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

To be, be, honk, to honk.

Beep, to be, honk, boom, beep, boop.

Right, left, right, left, blinkers on the car.

Thank you.

Thank you so much.

Y'all got me to most of me right now.

Thank you.

I got me thinking about my family.

Yeah, and your father, Jim Parton.

That song really touched me.

Oh my goodness.

And your mother, Johnny Galecki, right?

Of course.

She changed her day.

Can I ask, why in the second song do trucks cry gas?

And in that song they cry by honking.

Well, you know trucks, you can't just, it's just new to different things.

Oh, it's all the same.

Trucks are not a monolith.

Okay, sorry.

There's, you know, in between with trucks, you know, there's a...

You're getting very serious here.

I think everyone is wondering one very specific question.

So you are having sex with your truck.

Remember we told you we were substitute teachers at the truck high school?

Yeah.

Well, we slipped up.

Oh, no.

We, we fucked up.

You fell in love with some of these trucks?

Yeah, we was in there and they had that, you know, a truck with a step side.

Yeah.

Oh.

They got that like, it's a real curvy truck.

And they're not, they're not supposed to be showing those stepsides at the high school.

No, they're rules against that.

They're supposed to have on cabs on the truck, back cabs.

But you love your curvy truck.

I love my curvy truck.

Yeah.

I got a fate.

You guys very much though treat these trucks and if they are people, you've answered for more fives than...

And it's like, it's almost like a comedic...

A whole layer of ice.

A comedic, the vibe.

No, we are real people.

You guys are real.

I can see you.

I'm looking right at you.

Yeah, yeah.

You're looking right, although you haven't brought your trucks in here.

Well, I mean, here's what I, here's what I know.

If you put gas in the freezer, it becomes your life.

Okay.

Number one.

There you go.

There.

That is how you do it.

Truck birthday.

It's Friday night.

Truck birthday party.

So good.

That song was in my head for a really long time.

Yeah.

And specifically the part.

So I got some candles and I got some cake.

Just that.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Because normally if you were talking, you would say, so I got some candles and cake.

But to fit the meter of the song.

It's very songy.

Yeah.

It's almost like you made two trips.

So I got some candles.

Went home.

And went back and got some cake.

Realized I should get cake.

But the things to put the candles on.

Yeah.

Well, that was great.

We had such fun with these guys.

They came up to Toronto.

Toronto.

And Toronto.

They did, they, as Bill Riley did it, they fucked it and did it live.

We fucked and did it live.

And so yeah, a clear, clear favorite.

No, no doubt that it would be a number one.

In fact, let's.

Let's go through some of the stats.

Oh.

Do you want to go through some of the stats of the voting this year?

Yeah.

Okay.

I feel like it would be rude to say no.

Okay.

We got over 30,000 votes this year.

Nice.

And three out of four people voted for Memphis, Kansas, Breeze.

75% of the people voted for Kansas Breeze.

That's the last one.

So it was pretty much a landslide.

That one was the clear winner the entire time.

Actually, the rankings did not move very much, right?

From the eligibility, people voted for about two weeks this time.

And it was pretty much the same.

A lot of years they move up, they move down.

You never know.

It makes it hard to plan this show.

But pretty much these episodes were pretty clearly in the order that they were in.

I bet because of the descriptions.

Maybe because of the descriptions.

And it helps people.

Now, people can't see how well the episodes are doing in the rankings.

They have no idea.

No.

So let's talk about the months that had the most, like the greatest runs.

Obviously those curious clumps.

That curious clump.

That's very curious to me.

August had three episodes in the top 15.

Three of the four eligible episodes ended up in the top 15.

So that's a great clump.

December, January, March and October each had two episodes end up in the top 15.

Decent clump.

February, May, June and July had one of their episodes ended up in the top 15.

Not a great clump.

And then April, September and November's Euro.

Not even a clump.

Terrible clumping.

Yeah, terrible clumping.

So obviously the greatest run in there was the June, July, August.

We got five of those episodes in the top 15.

So that was pretty impressive there.

As I said earlier, two episodes from December ended up, which was pretty incredible because that never happens.

Do you know what I think it is?

School vacation.

School vacation?

School vacation.

All the performers were off from school for the summer.

Oh.

And then they had Christmas break.

Obviously that's what it is.

And then those other monsters went back in school.

Obviously this solves it all.

Yes.

Let's talk about certain performers.

There were a lot of people who ended up in one of the episodes in the top 15, but these people ended up in two.

We have Tim Balts, Carl Tarte, Will Hines, Sean.

No, sorry.

But these ended up in the top two.

We have Jessica McKenna, Andy Daly, John Gabris, Drew Tarver and Thomas Middleditch.

They were all in two episodes in our top 10.

Now in three episodes, we have Tim Balts, Carl Tarte, Will Hines and Sean Distin.

They all ended up, had three episodes in our top 15.

Very nice.

Jason Manzukas was in four of the episodes in our top 15.

And the undisputed winner in five of the top 15, we have Paul Lefthon, Kinsen Selle, made the most appearances in our top 15.

Well, I couldn't have done it without having been on the show.

That's true.

And in fact, you were in less episodes than you normally are in a year.

That's true.

I believe you were only on seven episodes and five of those turned out to be in our best stuff.

Yeeing.

Well, I'm glad to have been a part of such fun.

Yes.

You were in the live episodes, of course, which sort of make up for it.

Makes up for it.

Certainly.

So some good stats.

Some good stats.

And thank you for providing those stats.

I always like to provide the stats.

Yeah, you too.

You do like to do that.

I do like to provide the stats.

Yeah.

Every party, there's always like everybody be quiet.

Shut up, Kyle.

The party stats.

Party stats.

Oh, the hors d'oeuvres put out.

Well, that is, that's going to do it another year in the books.

We did it, man.

You know what I mean?

I mean, it really, it was a good year.

I thought, oh, the other, the other stat I wanted to mention is a lot of years there are certain episodes that no one even votes for.

This year, every episode got a healthy amount of votes.

Aww.

So pretty consistent year, I would say.

So it looks like the one big stat that we can take away from this is love.

Love.

The biggest stat of all.

I thought this was a great year.

I had a ball doing comedy bam bam this year.

I hope that you all enjoyed it listening from your voting.

It seemed like you did.

Those are some great clips, great episodes.

And so I want to thank you, the listeners for listening to it.

It's a pleasure to be on this ride with you for however long it goes.

This feels like an unending roller coaster sometimes with the ups, the downs, the loop-d'iloops.

What's past is history.

The future is a mystery.

Mmm.

I am a history and you are a mystery.

Okay.

You should have ended after the first two lines.

Those made sense.

It felt like they needed two more lines and I guess I was wrong.

Paul, I want to thank you for being a part of Comedy Bambang, not only this year 2019, but also every year.

You're one of the few people, if not the only person where can't imagine doing the show without you, were I to have to?

Sure.

Would I soldier on and try to?

Of course.

Okay.

No, but obviously doing these at the end of the year is a lot of fun, but also your presence on the show so much means a lot to me and I'm sure the fans.

So thank you very much.

Well, Scott, thank you for having me be a part of this for so long.

I've said it before and I will say it again, that the hours that I have spent laughing in this room, I count as among the happiest I have spent in my life.

Thank you, Paul.

Thank you, Scott.

And to the listeners, of course, the mere fact that the show just keeps on growing and more and more people listen to it is so flattering.

So I really want to thank all of you for listening.

And I want to thank everyone here at earwolf who makes the show happen from the metadata to putting it up on the hosting files to the pinging of iTunes.

So obviously it's much more complicated than that, but we've had three engineers just even doing these best ofs.

They've been doing it in shifts.

Why don't we do this in shifts?

Yeah, why don't we get substitutes?

Kevin and you song in here.

Everyone here at earwolf who supports the show really want to thank you.

And I think 2020, you know, who knows what's in store for us, but we're going to be a comedy for sure.

Certainly.

This is going to be a tough year, I would imagine.

But I look forward to doing it next year or this year actually because we're in January.

And we'll be there along with you trying to make you laugh and get through whatever you're getting through every Monday and occasional Thursdays.

So thank you all.

I also thank you all.

So say we all.

And as we do always, we end as we do all well first.

One of our one traditions we haven't talked about it, of course, is notorious power bottom epinees are screws.

Do we need to mention him?

We should mention him.

Just give him a shout out.

I wish we'd gotten him in during Christmas week.

But here he is.

No, we're thinking about you.

Ebenezer screws.

We're definitely thinking about you.

Let's play this snowman game and see what happens.

One more time.

Here we go.

That is the thing that you need to hit in order to go.

All right, he's singing.

The snowman is now twirling and.

Whoa, right on Paul.

Right on Paul.

Amazing.

Right on me.

Yeah.

Oh, oh, two Kevin.

Do Sam.

Come on, guys.

Come on.

Here we go.

No, nobody.

One more.

Look at the booth.

You motherfucker.

Whoa, right on Sam.

Kevin.

Should all the acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?

Should all the acquaintance be forgot and it's a bold laying sign.

For all the things I'm my dear.

For all the things I'm.

Will take a cup of kindness then for all the things I'm.

Thanks everyone.

We'll see you next year.

Bye.

the.

You I'm going to go back to the next slide.
