guest who's to the left of you and directly in front of me he is a stand of comedian he was just called one of the top 50 comedians to watch is that how many there were how many were there I think there are only 10 there's only 10 oh wow there's a very big difference 50 and so you're a comedian to watch me I guess that doesn 't work on a podcast because we have to listen to you yeah you can feel it though okay okay I just wants to feel can I make that list yeah please yeah 50 comedians to feel I make that list yeah I feel it a feel in you right now oh man I'm a cold come on see this is what this is what she does Gerard she and I'll introduce you Gerard Carmichael is here hey everybody this this is what she does she she throws it out there once you and then the minute you pick up on it I didn't I just said I'm feeling his comedy oh oh okay that's not right don't get any weird ideas and here it comes the second part of it yeah yeah where she tells you that you have the problem let it happen naturally okay a couple years before you were born R Kelly and Alia had a song called a change nothing but a number and you should listen to that song and realize that it's a lie oh shit it's a lie it's a lie age is more than another it's more than a number it's a statute of them that's true a lot of things that he did R Kelly get in trouble for that not for that song this before did he pee on that woman okay this kid okay did he pee on somebody did he pee with an erect penis as well that's the one that I don't understand like that's tough for me as fate was a little rishi standing okay you can you can you can I know you can't it's tough it's tough it's it was like um you know it's got one function it's you switch it to do one thing and not the other here's the problem I don't want everybody here's the problem a girl was Piedon and our issue was with the logistics of it yeah a girl was Piedon period that's the problem if she stood here then could you I don't know by the way and I was saying this on Twitter the other day and Marissa Marissa yes yeah I'm sorry I was just so boring to you that you can't remember my name it's only been thought I got it wrong I was afraid man if if if you're a person who does not want to give a blowjob if that grosses you out then just think about it that the erect penis is actually filled with blood under there and stuff you tweet it it is that is that to humanize the penis it's like it's like that's the problem with blowjobs people don't realize that people don't realize that there's a ton of blood in there the penis the penis is a person I'm never gonna do it now I will never do it now okay oh you seem upset about that I said okay I'm kidding I don't I don't appreciate that kind of like is that the kind of language Miss Lizzler teaches you oh god there's no rules down there in that basement no rules all right let's sorry let's so okay I want you to interview Gerard here because you know nothing about him nor anyone who's ever on the show no interesting and I don't care you know what it'll be like this podcast is gonna be like when you scram for a test you get all the information and then immediately after you take this you forget about it I won't remember having met or talk to any of you by the time I'm in my stepdad's car that's good enough to drive it back to read over it said he's outside he's waiting for me outside in the car he is the car running yeah that's a waste of gas because our show can go an hour for 15 hours who knows he don't want to come supervise no no no he doesn 't want to be involved in the entertainment bid he just kind of drops you off everywhere yeah he drops me off and then who knows where maybe set the end of number I don't know and I don't care just live your life all right so I want you I want you to perform your co-hostly duties and interview you drawed and we would do all right sorry you could tell me what to do go ahead all right I've been very aggressive today you are I yeah if you could take it down a notch yeah just one notch okay because I know you're gonna ramp up to three more not just take it start low all right drawed is a draw tell me how to draw drawed okay drawed drawed the let's start from the beginning where where are you born drawed a North Carolina oh all right and you have brothers and sisters yes I have a brother and are

how do you know what Charlie Rose does why is a 15 year old girl watching Charlie Rose I mostly watch PBS really yes that's it she Gerad she's a weirdo wow yes strange taste that for teacher I know what I just put myself in the face of this microphone yeah you still get used to things like that oh no it doesn 't have any blood in it oh Gerard you seem like a very nice guy and I know that you wouldn't be talking this way to me if it weren't for first a chalk tall over here shut bringing it bringing it down okay anyway no my point I try tell me tell me about your comedy how do you how do you come up with your bit strong this is a great question I don 't I don't really know it just you feel it yeah I just feel it I just feel it is am I being a horrible guess but just talking about

yeah let's do a table turn ready and table turn that sounded like an as explosion as explosion is that a common a condom thing the common thing oh no I don't think it when a condom explodes when you're in someone has asked has that happened can that's an ass below well with the force of which oh god I can't ejaculate you know what Seth if he's listening is gonna get really pissed off about how Seth ever listened to anything you've ever done never and he does not listen to anything I said he's an absentee step parent yes I'm gonna be too deep into the entertainment yeah no he does yeah he doesn't want it well I would rather my family see myself as oh god am I yelling I gotta back it up from the mic I would just not yell me no that's not gonna be possible I'd rather than see me as me

all right draw it hit me and don't don't be afraid to get personal hey Marissa oh god that voice I could listen to that voice for the rest of my life could you that's the truth you only have to do it for a year that's it what what happens when the year is over by the way when the next tenor are introduced oh so you saying it's all over after that yeah I mean that is yeah I'm trying to make it on a top five list oh okay yeah eventually you got to number one then you then you're on there's no list do you hope to be a better stand up comedian then Luis C.K. then or Bobcat yeah of course yeah is that yeah I think if you're not gonna shoot Bobcat gold I mean he's great well I mean he's comedian the show and filmmaker yeah but I mean if you're not gonna shoot that high I say why why bother yeah what's the point you know what I mean so good for you good for you all right go ahead ask Marissa anything oh wait you need to understand but he just gave me a look that was right to my soul Wow so I'm ready for this okay hello Marissa how are you a sexy southern voice you're not being weird okay I say more of it you know what I mean and there's only a nine year age difference between actually I can see this working you know my wife is ten years younger than than I am so you know I mean you know well it's not it's crazier things have happened is what I'm saying crazier things have happened that someone married you yes go on fuck you all right let's give back on track you're I'll go ahead ask her you do realize I'm approaching this interview like a social worker why because I seem like I might be retarded she's a troubled child and yeah we talked about that you your class the Miss Lisler Todd oh that wasn't technically is a special ed class technically there were people there who didn't have all of their muscular control all true oh my question sound like it's okay tell me tell me get Marissa first of all are you okay is everything going well everything's going well you know this is it's the summer which I love it summer is a time of rejuvenation if you were a social worker and you got an answer like this thing swell the summer is for rejuvenation what exactly would you think is a social worker saying I would say what what were you being exhausted from from the spring okay tell me more about you tell me so now tell me more about your spring okay I'll tell you about my spring and what drained you which re igned be is I was editor of the literary magazine okay um the gimlet and and guess what happened we I published a poem that a woman wrote a girl wrote right very sexual it was about you know jazz notes hanging off her erect nipples etc and I thought this is gonna get this is gonna make the gimlet fly right off the off the off the stands I publish it turns out she's having a relationship with our choir teacher oh so hence the subtle metaphor yeah and meanwhile I feel bad for her because I'm thinking you know she knows that most of try to grow I 'm thinking oh you know she must be bringing all this in your imagination but it was really happening so that was a huge it was really happening that she was hanging I don't know how that's possible it's a metaphor do you know what I'm better for it so anyway so that was a big scandal okay do you find that to be commonplace at your school that the students are sexualized by the teachers yes well you have to understand that they're all wanting and they want to steal your youth and that's the truth and I have about four or five teachers I know would would love to take me as a lover I'm sure of it and that happens in the spring they try to drain you and steal your you know white yeah but but um but so I was summer is summer is where you have a sort of a refuge from the teachers yes it's rejuven ated yes exactly we're getting to the heart of it now the something stressful about the summer is that there are a lot of pool parties and I don't know why you're laughing it's very stressful yeah yeah because you know people don't see you unclothed during the year and you can do a lot which leads me to my next question that you just answered yeah thank you good what was it I was very concerned the people saw you unclothed during the year they don't they don't but then and then suddenly in the summer you're like oh okay this is what I look like in my underwear no thank you because I have I'm gonna get honest with you guys because I do a lot of things to disguise you know slim down I wear double specs to school oh my double is that that it seems like that would just add two layers that would basically don't you know I had never thought of that cancel each other yeah thanks don't make it right I double spanks myself wow to make sure things are smooth mm-hmm so now because what the you guys haven't seen me but I'm real skinny up top okay but larger on the bottom oh you know what I mean so you're like the pyramids yes yes yes pear pear shape some people call it but the pyramids is another way to put it you have a pointy head so there's not much you can do except open you up and see what treasures lie within ew see what I mean that kind of shit goes on every time I come I'm sorry I apologize I should have said that oh boy so it's tough for you because you don't you don't how do you get around that in a bikini um well I wear usually how um something akin to what they used to wear like a 1920s baby costume made out of wool oh wow kiss to you the mystery alive so you're sort of do you play into that like you're a deed of auntie yes kind of like I'm doing this year okay I'm a pin up girl I'm a pin up girl but here's the thing but it really just looks like you're an eccentric weirdo well you call it what you will but the wool gets very heavy when wet mm-hmm so I have holes I have almost drowned myself yeah you say to the bottom mark hobbies pool party there was a situation and they had to actually jump in and grab and pull me out wow because of the wool because of the wool it gets real because this was I mean I got it on eBay god knows you know what I mean it was vintage oh so other vintage wool other people have worn it who are probably ghosts now probably probably you have a haunted bathing suit you know you never think about that when you go to a vintage store yeah but you're wearing ghost clothes ghost living those clothes yeah they should call them ghost clothes instead of vintage stores no thank you yeah anyway so that's the story and but I'm rejuvenating and we'll get back into by the time September comes time to want but up time to want but up and your your teachers back to the grind yeah back to the grind back to fending off all their sexual all right well I have to take a break here but when we come back I want to hear more about you your plans we also have a very special guest friend of the show Paul Rust will be here oh I love that guy yeah yeah all of that coming up right on the other side of this will be right back with comedy bang bang well put up comedy bang bang we are back with Gerard Carmichael top 10 top 10 comedian of all time I like to I like the sound of that actually yeah can you text my answer and also Marissa

Yeah, it had vista, Del Bill Maher. It's vista, Del Maher. And that's people. I made a mistake. I actually went to the comedian Del Mars. Oh, first time. Not a good haircut. It's barber.

Smores Moore. He is a sexual man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. C ackies. I know she has a man, can of cool pencil down there. Yeah. Were you hard for most of your new known house? I kept pushing the little thing at the bottom of the man can of pencil that makes it make the extent. I pitched the top of my pubes. And then at the tip of my penis comes out.

Good little bit of a graphite. Great. And I tried to use it once on my SATs. It didn't work. No.

Just I don't think you did your pita's on any sort of test.

I don't know. Test. No, no, no, no, no, no. If you got a study for a test, then I should be allowed to study for all your tests. Okay, I'm going to take all your tests for you. Okay, that sounds great.

Like that. How does that feel? Good. It feels good. No, it feels good. I know that's steamed. Did you graduate high school though? No. I don't know whether you would want them to take your test. I graduated from the school of Mar. Mar.

Marvellous comedy. Bill Mar. Yeah. Marvellous kind of. Oh, that's a fantastic. That should be his new special. John, what do you think of that style of comedy? Bill Mar? Is it too confrontational right here that sometimes? Oh, Paul Russ, it spoke to me, honestly. Yeah. Like you, I felt when you were talking, I felt like you were saying the things that I want to say. But I'm not afraid. Yeah, but I'm too afraid to say. Does it get scary?

Like I feel like I intruded in your head space. Like I some transcribed your. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was it was like, who's are you like, are you following me that type of thing? He is following you. On Twitter.

Yeah. On Twitter. Oh, okay. Yeah. That's good. What's your Twitter again, by the way?

Oh, everyone can follow you. Oh, people are going to do it?

I'm going to tweet back at people.

Okay. Yeah. What is it? I forget. Wait. Oh, notorious ROD.

No, no, for the record. Yeah. I had that like handle. That was like my AOL instant messenger screen name. And like before you were born, even. Oh, yes. Yeah.

Before you were born. Yeah. You you don't remember a L L right? It was a thing before you were born. No, it sounds horrible. You've got mail. Well, it was pretty funny. Right. It was how you communicate it with your friends. You, you know, logged into aim. And if you ever wanted to make one of your friends laugh, you would say, you've got mail. It's pretty good. That didn't seem like a laugh. That seems more like you're having a seizure. That joke keeps like comments. Yeah. I love to hear about the olden days, guys. Why don't you keep talking while I take a brief nap. Gerard, why are you so afraid in your comedy? I've been meaning to ask that. Why?

I mean, you're only a 24 year old kid, so you're still afraid to say stuff like Paul, but well, yeah. Well, you say, what is it about fear?

Why are you so afraid? Well, I'm you're a fear based comic, right? Yeah. Well, the thing is, I'm it's like texting. I'm not gonna who's gonna who covers that? You know, who's speaking who's saying that? Yeah. It's funny that you guys talk about fear because like when I start getting scared when I'm making a joke, I know I'm doing something right. Yeah. I know I'm going into a place.

Yeah. Yeah. That needs to go. How do you face it though?

How do you just?

It's funny, when I get to the punchline, that's what you curl up into a little ball. Oh, wow.

Yeah. Right. Yeah. And you start crying. I cry. And then the tears run onto a piece of paper. Yeah.

And they sort of form like a what are those called the the tests with the? A warch a warchack.

A warchack. That's another test you can use your penis on by the way to create one.

Oh, I only see man canada co pencils in my rorsheck. Yeah.

Man can now is it true also that you listen to whale music when you're writing most of your jokes? Yeah. You love the beluga whale. Yeah, I love it. But I had heard that I'd read that about you.

Well, there are in fortune magazine.

A lot of people think Lenny Bruce was sort of the original like truth teller, but yeah, whales were.

Yeah. The whales were the original. Yeah. Yeah. Sayers of comedy. Yes. Okay.

Well, how many issues of Forbes magazine were you on the cover of? I think they did you for a whole year, right? Well, it was like, you had a column. It was like, oh, it was a front cover column.

They put it on the front of the sidebar. Yeah. And the column was no, no, no.

Right. Always. You guys, huh? That's a that's your signature. Sort of a signature. Yeah, we heard it a little earlier. Yeah. Yes. That's right. Yeah. Okay.

Wait, did you forget that that had happened?

No, no, no. No, we've heard them all. We've heard them all.

I think you don't have any more new notes. No, no, no. Okay. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Marissa.

Yes. Back to you for a second.

What else are you doing this summer? I know you always have a lot of activities going on. You volunteer at the library. Yes. Well, I'll be taking some trips. Vacation family vacays. Family vacays.

Who's your mother again? Why? No reason. I just we've talked about it. She's not single. So don't.

I know. She's with Seth, right? Yes. Yeah. My mom, my mom's name is Diane. Okay. She's a cardiologist.

Seth is an eye surgeon. So they're both doctors. They're not home very often. Diane, I call her Diane.

Good. Diane and I have. When did you start that, by the way ? When I was four years old. Okay.

Diane and I have a complicated relationship. Yeah. The only time we really bond is when we are at a DSW shoe warehouse. And I have been kicked out of a lot of cars on my way home and been forced to walk home. Forced to use those shoes. Yeah, because I have a smart mouth. Yeah. So Diane and I are working. You wait 10 years. It's going to start paying off.

Yeah, right? Yeah. Take it from us comedians. And you guys have a life I'm definitely inspiring to. Let me tell you. I'm pretty sure Scott sleeps in this place. You do, don't you? I do.

Everyone's a lot. You take these blankets off the wall and you make a pad out of them and you sleep like late night shows here early shows just you know what I mean? Why bother to take the five minutes to go home? Sure. It's like Motown. It's like Hittsville in here. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Yeah. The sound of young America. The sound of young America. So yeah, we're going to take some trips up to Santa Barbara to the wine country.

Now, is it just you, Diane, Seth and Lisler? Does she come along? Well, Lisler doesn't technically come along. She just follows. She has shown up at certain BNB's.

Which she says is a you know, like a coincidence, but I don't think that's true. And it's her way BNB bed and breakfast. Oh, and it's her right to be at these places. Yeah, of course, she's paid the money. Sure. But but yeah, and that can get a bit awkward. Diane doesn't care for Lisler. Oh, okay. Does Seth know who she is? Oh, yes.

If you remember from the last episode with a headed incident. That Oh, yeah, the whole the don't turn around at the refrigerator. So either of them they would like me to know the standoff that lasted six hours or so or he was naked at the refrigerator. She showed up. Yes.

And ordered him to turn around and he would not do it and he wouldn't do it.

Wow. For six hours until she got tired and fell asleep. It got really weird. So they don't see but again, you know, I did your parents ever when you were younger, not like one of your friends.

And sure. Yeah. And were they always right? Yeah. Yeah.

What? Pretty much the time.

Well, then I'm sorry. I asked that question because they're not right about Lisler.

So anyway, I don't care what Diane thinks about Lisler.

That's just, you know, she's going to have to deal with it. I didn't like Seth, but he moved in and then yeah. And you know, he took my room and I had to move into the office.

Wait, why is so Diane and Seth sleep apart? Yeah, because like the snoring that yeah, well, Seth has sleep apnea. Okay. But also they say that it keeps their love making fresh. Oh, okay. Always constantly having to go into different rooms. They like take a diagonal pack and overnight bag and pretend she's sleeping over.

Some lunchables. Again, this isn't what yeah. It's more like dinnerables at that time.

So midnight snackables for me. Yeah, sure. No, no, no, is that a new?

Midnight snack. Midnight snackables. Midnight snackables.

Okay, good. It's a good new. No, no, what it is. At any rate. So that's what we're going to be doing that. And then I'll be.

Where did the office go if you had to move into the office?

Well, the office doesn't have a door or a wall or wall. It's a condo. So it's like two plus a den. So I'm sleeping in that den now.

Can I ask you a question? Sure. Do you find it a little strange that both of your fans are doctors, but like you stay like a condo. Like I would just imagine that what's wrong with the condo? No, I mean, okay, it's not wrong with a car. It's mostly Marina Del Rey. Okay, it's a straight right now. Yeah, I really don't know. Time low. They're like, they're busy doctors like they like the surgeons. Yeah. Yeah. And you don't find it a little strange that you feel like they're doing that. They don't have a room for you. Yeah. Like I mean, not just about it now. Not just a condo, but an inefficient condo. Like a condo without all this space.

Why can't they get a three bedroom? Yeah. Yeah. At the very least. I mean, you would think on a two bedroom in a den situation going on. They have a two plus den. It's almost as it's only 1100 square feet. How many baths? One and a half.

One and a half. Oh my gosh.

Yeah. And I have to use the half bath. There's no shower in there. No, I have to do like a show. Yeah. Yeah. It's time to start questioning. What are you talking about? It's a term. You're right. You know what? I don't I get the sense that that Seth and Diane want to feel like they don't have children. Does that make sense? No, you don't think so. Say that. That's the Are you sure, Paul? How what was your situation growing up?

Well, families, you know, that's that's the new terrain for me. That's the, you know, I do a lot of things of you're delving into that. Are you doing family counseling? Mainly for the benefit my new no-nose. Yeah. No, no. Okay.

If you're my dad, then I should be able to make you my son.

Okay. If you call me a blue doppler, then I should be able to adopt you and call you son.

Raise you. Where support you? Sure. Feed and glow view. No, no, dad's the son now.

Okay. I like it. Do you hear the truth in his voice? Oh my god. I'm afraid right now.

I'm like, I have closed off body language. I'm about to call a blue ball. I'm just worried people are going to take up my crazy ideas and actually do implement them. Yeah. Are you afraid of that or is that the thing you want most? It wouldn't be good for society. Yeah. I mean, you think this loon should be running things? No. I mean, I just stand off to the side and make jokes. I mean, either your maniac. I thought about public office, but yeah , my maniacs would vote for me. I know that.

Of course they would. Leave that to the clowns in Washington. I think, you know what?

They're bigger clowns. I think the circus, you know, on its travels, I know it was going from town to town for a while. And I think it made a stop in Washington and stayed there. Yeah.

Stayed there. You see what I'm trying to say. Yeah. Yeah.

Because clowns are running long.

Yeah. Yeah. Well, to continue the train theme, I think when they were handing out brains, I'm not for sure about this, but I believe some of those politicians thought they were saying trains. Yeah. And they said, no, we already have trains. We don't need brains. We don't need trains. So keep going. Keep going with the brains. Keep move on.

Because we have trains on this because we as politicians have trains already.

No, no, no. Oh, you have no, no, no. That's copyrighted. So is whopping up. It's my, it's Dennis Miller's got his rants. Yeah. Bill Maher's got his new rules. Yeah. And I got my new Nellies. Oh, no, no, no. Sorry. No, no, no. Can we get that out? It's our new Nellies.

It's got it. It's got a wook at it out. Don't worry. Oh boy . That was close. Wow.

Christ. Wow. Oh, fucking shit. It's close. It's really close. Boy, I'm so sorry. He almost lost everything. He almost lost his fortune. He almost lost his fortune. Like the Empire was starting to crumble. Yeah. You could see it. New known us.

It's new known us. Oh, good.

How many times do you have to repeat it in the morning when you wake up to yourself?

I'd say it about 10, 12 times per single when I wake up.

And then about. And a weed-wacking session.

Then we'd whack it out. But then what happens with the old, are they like, are they written? Are they where the? Do I like, what do I do with the old ones? What do you do with the old? No, no. Yeah.

How do you recycle your old, no, no. Well, a lot of it helps, you know, a lot of the old stuff, you know, like CB stuff can now be made into Twitter, you know. So you mean the no-nose that you used to do on CB radio? Yeah, a lot of it. A lot of my new knowns about CB radios can now easily be Twitter, you know. So before it was like, no, no, if you love CB so much, then I should be allowed to have many CB radio stations in my house. What happens when now I can say, no, no, no, you have Twitter, I should be able to have Twitter in my house. What happens when a no-no keeps like coming up, like it keeps presenting itself like an aggravated no-no?

No, if a no-no isn't solved, what is the statute of limitations on a no-no? Like if it's not solved in two years, what happens? Well, I'd like to say I know what happens, but I'm proud to say that every no-no, no, I have it gets implemented. And within two years, I've eradicated the problem.

You've eradicated the no-no. So it rarely rears its head.

Wow. CB radio died because of my new no-no's about. Wow. And also you buying them all up and putting them in your house. Keep it in my house.

Yeah, there's a shortage. Wow, interesting stuff. All right , guys, well, I think we just have time for one more segment on the show and it's a little something we call wood, you rather.

That reminds me of game of game. Shut it.

But seriously, it does nourish. Shut shut shut your mouth.

Would you rather theme as in progress? Shut up.

This is a price, Marissa.

This is a new game of game. Oh, fuck. I'm gonna disinvite you.

Yeah, I won, I won, I won.

All right, it's time to play. Would you rather?

And we all know how this is played.

Let's do it. All right, people said me, would you rather scenarios at our Twitter, which is CBB-WIR comedy bang bang, would you rather? And I read them on the show and then I'll open the floor for questions. You can ask me any question you like about either of the scenarios in order to narrow down your choice. I have all the information about either of them here in my head and then I'll ask you to vote and we'll tally up the points and Marissa, since you talked during the theme, you were starting at negative 162. I didn 't know there was a rule.

It's not. No, no, no. If you can't talk for the scene, then I get to have your brand new stage. Marissa actually had some people write for me. So I would love to do that. I would love to commit something new. Sounds like a great hobby for you.

I'd love to come over to your house, just bring Jai with you in brain jam. Brain jam. Yeah, weed wackin brain jam it. Oh boy. Yeah.

Wackin' weed jammin' brain. Today's new no-no comes to us from, oh no, this is a would-you-rather scenario. Oh, Cesar, he's doing your shit. Easy there. Easy there, Chuck-tah. Today's comes to us from Phil Rudditch, or Rudditch, Phil Rudditch. He asks, would you rather have a bathroom radar that makes you aware of when everyone around you needs to use the bathroom? Or work in a restaurant in which twice a day you chop your fingers off and they're served in fancy meals? All right, would you rather have a bathroom radar that makes you aware of when everyone around you needs to use the bathroom? Or work in a restaurant in which twice a day you chop your fingers off and they're served in fancy meals? All right, I'm opening the floor for questions. Okay. All right, Jarrah, is right off the bat. How invasive is the radar? How invasive-oh, meaning what's the perimeter?

Yeah, is it like, you know how like when people can read minds, but then it becomes overwhelming?

Like is it-is it like-like I'm talking about for me, like if you had to go right now, is it a constant alert? This is not a mental radar, by the way.

This is a radar-oh, on my phone, like an app?

I mean, eventually they'll invent that. Yeah, but currently it's just a-it's a large kind of machine that you have to carry around with it. Oh, and what does it do? It pings every time someone around you in-and let's say it's a five mile radius . Any time anyone in a five mile radius has to use the bathroom. So it just kind of goes-what's the scale? I mean, what's the-the criteria for having to go a bathroom? Is it just a little bit-because we all kind of have to go right now. Everybody has to go all the time. Any time anyone has the slightest drop of pee-oh, well then that's-it's a non-t-it's just a long beep -it. It's a constant din of beep-it.

Yeah, the beeps-the beeps are like five-minute beeps for each person. Yeah. That's constant. That's-oh, that's gonna be constant beeping. That's-okay. Okay. But the people around you can't hear this, because you're forced to wear headphones and only you can hear it. Oh, well that's gonna-so-okay.

Okay, but there are-I mean, are there political, social gains that can be made in knowing somebody's-oh, oh yes. You think-you are able to come out, you have a blog that says who has to go to the bathroom at any given time? Stephan Ap ollus has to take a shit.

Yeah, it really brings down a lot of-is-is the question.

Are they the headphones? Are they like these? Are they smaller? Can you see- Are they earbuds? Are they earbuds? No, they're-they're actually built into a giant Afro wig. So no one knows you have headphones. Can I-so-okay.

They just think that you have a giant-can I also-wig. Can I -it's a rainbow Afro wig, by the way.

Just like the John 3 16 guy. Oh wow. Yeah. Wow. Can I play music in these headphones?

You can try to play music in the headphones. You're not able to hear it because of the long- Yeah, because of the beep-set. Oh yeah, I didn't know. Is there a way to kind of use the beeps and sort of a mash-up way? The only song that you're able to-to audibly hear is the Pussycat Dolls Beep song.

So-oh wow. What about that old 60s song? The Beep-Beep-Car Traffic song? Oh yeah. Is that- Yeah, Amanda, you can hear that song. Good. Because that's all I listen to. So this- maybe I'll- This situation might work out? No. Onto the-oh. Yeah. So then when you cut off your fingers, do they grow back the next day? They grow back right before you have to cut them off again.

So do you spend some time with no fingers? 23 hours and 45 minutes with no fingers.

Okay, because I have to really ruin your wheat wack in session. It's true. It's very hard to hold the wheat wack. Very hard to hold the wheat wack and have- When the fingers grow back, is it a painful experience? Is it like when Wolverine's- Wolverine's- Or is it like Spider-Man, like, you know, with the lizard technology and it's just like, and it's just like, oh my finger, I didn't feel it was correct. Oh, it's back. Is it disgusting like a fetus finger? Right. Yeah.

You don't grow your final layer of epidermis until- Right.

So you have about 14 minutes where it's like kind of slimy and it's hard to touch anything because the nerve endings are- You know, I'll say- Yeah, you have to work. But you have to cut it off for- Is it in the dish?

Yeah, no, you serve it in the dish. So you have to work in the- It does sound like it though.

You have to work in the kitchen. So you're constantly having to touch hot things with these fingers that don't have the- The layer of epidermis. Who eats your fingers? I mean, is it kings?

Is it- It's George Stephanopoulos and other political figures. Oh, he shits them out?

Yeah, he shits them out and then- Do they want- I've heard of finger foods.

Do you get to chew? No, no, no. Finger foods. No, no, finger foods should be hand foods.

Pick them up with your hands. What are you? Yeah, quit picking up foods with your fingers and pick them up with your hands, people. Yep. Great new, no, no. Yeah, I like that. Oh, this is, you know, I would do the beeps. Oh, you voted early. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to doc you another 162 points. Oh, my God. Currently, you're a negative three.

Can I say, Marissa, you are 124. You make all the mistakes that I'm about to make. Like , you'll like that car that's speeding on the highway. You're welcome. That's just Lauren State Troopis. Life is a highway. I want to ride it all night long. How do you know that? How do you know that song or van? I heard it on an oldie's station. Or an oldie's like you. Any other questions about either of the scenarios here?

Where's this? What's the restaurant? Applebee's. Or do people enjoy? Applebee's too. No, it's actually Applebee's four. Oh, I've been checking fingers.

Yeah. Applebee's. Do people enjoy eating the food? No, they hate it. They are forced. Are they like, Oh, my God, there's a finger in here and then they get really upset with you? They eat it first.

They're mainly concerned with the fingernails. That's really gross. Yeah, that can't be dig ested. Yeah, the fingers themselves are delicious, but the fingernails are kind of gross. And so they get ticked off that they get cheesed. They get real peeved and vexed that they've had.

Second thought? They've had to eat the fingers. I mean, I guess it's a benefit that if you are the ones who cutting off your fingers, you don't have to pull your fingernails off before cutting them off. That seems to be a nice. Yeah, that's a benefit. That would be an extra bit of pain. Yeah, it would be really bad if you were forced to definger yourself. Yeah, definger yourself. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Declal yourself.

Yeah. So what about the 2345 without fingers? The 15? Yeah, because I mean, I guess you also have to get into appliances. Like it's a very expensive lifestyle. How much am I making as a chef? How much you what's your take home? Yeah, because because I'm able to take home after taxes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Certainly you don't need money for gloves. No, no, no. He's no, no. Gloves should be mittens. Some of them are quite a pretty back mittens.

Almost last time you saw mitten. Quite often.

That's a good light. Yeah. Yeah. We got against mittens.

Your take home, your take home is, it's pretty big. It's approximately 27,000 a year. So you 're making less than the people that are consuming. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're rich people. Yeah, they're very wealthy people to be able to afford fingers. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's a delic acy. Yeah, it is a delicacy. Yeah. And it hurt when you cut them off. Oh, yeah, it hurts more than anything. Anything other than when they grow back and you're forced to touch hot pots without with fetus fingers. Yeah, exactly with slimy.

Slimy. Zygote. Zygote. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

All right. Any other questions here before we know? All right. I'm going to close up the floor here. All right. Girard, how do you like to vote?

Absolutely. The beeps. The beeps. Yeah. Okay.

Yeah. And why is that? The radar for the bathroom.

Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm trying to use. I mean, in comparison, it's really, it's, I mean, I actually think it'd be kind of cool to have that insight, you know, and to be, and to be able to just, you know, walk up to a woman. And that's like a great icebreaker. If I hear what you say. Yes. Like, yeah, it's like, hey, I know something about you. But she, I know something about you. I know about you.

That's what it, that's what a woman likes to hear, right? As a pick up line. He's, he's the thing. He's the thing. You, first of all, if I, if I approach it like that, I don't need to hear what she says back to me because the only, you don't hear it. The only sound is going to be made is the sound of a panties driving.

Do you hear what I'm saying? Yeah. I'm praying it cherries and listening to this.

She doesn't, she doesn't listen to my words. She just manages. I say listeners, male listeners out there. A typical manager. Am I right? Am I right? No, no, no. Manager should write your material. In addition to listening to it, they should write it all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you're a male listener, or even a female listener out there and you're coming on to a woman out there this weekend, I'd love to hear you say, I know something about you. I know, I think that would be an amazing, like, here's the thing.

The benefit is that what you know is that they have to go to the bathroom right now. They don't know that. Follow it up with that, by the way. Followed up with that. If you're at a bar and you go up to approach a woman and say, hey, I know something about you. Hey. And they'll be intrigued and they say, what do you mean? You need to go to the bathroom. As a matter of fact, you could even shorten it. Just, you walk up, you smile and you say, I know. I know. And then, uh, y'all gotta go guys, you know, you're, you're down the line. If you break up, you can have a whisper. I knew something about you.

Yeah. I know. Yeah. Just know that I knew. All right. So, Gerard, you vote for the, uh, I vote for knowing. For knowing. Yeah. Yeah. Vote for knowledge. You have to word it like pro life.

I vote for knowing. That's deep. Yeah. All right. Marissa, how do you like to vote?

I'm going to go with the radar as well. I really have a very low tolerance for pain.

Another vote for knowledge. Yeah. Another vote for knowledge. Okay. Yeah. That's it.

And the fact that you have legs that you have to cut off, um, every day that regrow in a more painful way than the fingers and the other scenario where, wait, what do you mean the legs?

Well, you didn't never asked about it. What? But yeah, you have legs that you have to cut off every day in the radar scenario. Yeah. So that doesn't bother you. No, it does bother me.

I want every do. No, you can't do it. See, that's why I always wanted to go first.

I'm doing it. I'm doing it. You can't, you can't just sing the beginning.

Wait, yes, I can't. I'm gonna have to retake. I'm gonna have to retake the entire show.

Yeah. Hey, this is Scott. I'm gonna chop top. All right.

Man. Well now, I'm sorry, but you can't revote. Paul, how do you, uh, how do you like it? I'm gonna go with cutting off the fingers.

All right. And why is that? Uh, you know, I can't, I wouldn 't be able to stand those beeps, you know, because I, I already got to listen to beeps every day, you know, because of your favorite song. And that's enough. That's enough beeps.

Because you know, you get the beep, beep, beep of those Washington fat cats in your ear, one minute, and then the beep, beep, beep of corporate wh ores like Donald Trump beeping in your ear.

So I got enough beeps, man. I don't know if I follow that.

All right. Well, let's tally up the points. Marissa, you, uh, you started at negative 344. That 's not good. Um, did I make up any of those points? And then you voted, you wrote a hundred and 84 tweet. You're going to have 140, 280.

No, no, no. Oh man. Oh God. What? What? No, no, no. We're all.

Man. Fuck you, man. That's what I would say. If you do math . All right. So I'm not doing well.

So you're not doing well, but you did vote for the correct scenario. Oh, I did. It gives you 500 points. So that's why I'm up. You're up, but Gerard, you also voted for the correct scenario.

So you're up to 500 total. So which eclipses yours. And Paul, I'm sorry, you didn't vote for the correct scenario. So you're still at zero. So Gerard, you're our winner. Congratulations.

Thank you. Thank you very much. And that is, of course, how you play. Would you rather?

Well, I learned.

Oh, Gerard, I'm sorry. You laughed.

Derivative. You have to take your victory away from you.

Marissa, you're our winner. You serious? I'm a champ. Mar issa, congratulations.

Oh, I'm sorry, Gerard. You're not allowed to laugh on comedy podcast.

Just sorry, man. Sorry. All right. Let's shut it down here.

That's all we have time for, guys.

Congratulations. We just have our last thing, which is, of course, plugs.

Oh, it wasn't important. I just lost on my points. I just wanted to say, fuck everybody.

Oh, oh, great. Thanks. Thanks for that.

He was so nice at the beginning. Yeah. That's before you took my points away.

Oh, what do you want to plug? What do you got coming up, sir?

It's a great question, Scott. I'll be around you guys.

So I like to go and I bring my beats, you know, whatever, fresh beats that I've discovered. Not beeps. Not the beeping that, of course, like political fat cats. And that's it. That's it for me.
