♪♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ Oh, the men of the Lord who spoke before alive, stood the audience.

That's the show that should have done the WandaVision, was the men of the Lord.

Yeah, the men of the Lord.

The men of the Lord did it. Like those shows are both so bad.

Just swap premises.

Oh, come on. You don't like Mando?

No, they're both great. That was my little joke of that.

They're both bad, but they're both good shows.

My joke was that I thought one was bad and one was good.

Oh, okay. We're joking around.

We're joking around.

Guys, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Best of 2021, my God.

Here we are.

Say, Gosh, please.

I'm so sorry.

Were you raised with Gosh?

I'm so sorry that I said, God.

Were you raised with Gosh instead of God?

I was. I don't think that I could have ever said...

I probably could have said, God, you know, referring to...

Our Heavenly Father, of course.

I use that pronouns.

Pronouns...

God, get that.

But no, I could not have said, God, certainly not God damn.

Certainly not like, oh, my God.

I think I couldn't have said that either.

Yeah. What do we say?

We could say, oh, my God. We could not say Jesus Christ.

No, we couldn't do that either.

And even to the point where after my mother was not religious anymore, I said, Jesus Christ in front of her and she like started.

And she was like, I forgot. I'm not religious.

I was like, yeah, you don't care anymore, right?

She goes, no, I know, but it's still it.

Yeah.

My dad is taking a saying shit a lot recently, which is like sort of surprising.

An old man's indulgence.

You first detect it?

Then he says it.

That is, of course.

No, stop it.

We don't want to be mentioned.

That is, of course, the freedom reference.

Guys, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

If this is your first episode, you don't know what the hell is going on.

Can you imagine Scott?

Sorry, Scott.

I'm not.

Yes.

Do you know what scenario I'm going to pause?

Okay, go ahead.

Go ahead.

Can you imagine God making a rock so heavy that even he can lift it?

I fucking got him.

Damn it.

So suddenly I'm a robot that just explodes.

That ticker tape comes out.

What is love?

What is a ticker tape parade?

Okay.

So ticker tape is the tape, you know, and like, but why is it, is it because they used to throw the ticker tape?

That's exactly what it is.

Okay.

There, I figured it out.

Yeah.

I figured it out with the pen.

You can still get it out.

I figured it out.

And then I threw it out the window wasteful.

Only five cents.

What you're listening to, if this is your first episode, and if this is even not your first episode, this is the best of Comedy Bang Bang.

And what you're also listening to this, if it's your last episode.

Very well, good beat.

I know a lot of people who they say, you know what?

That's another year in the books.

I'm done.

You're saying they don't go this far?

No, they, they, they listen this far and then they go like, okay, I don't think I need this for another year.

I can only imagine.

This meaning us?

Yeah.

What we're doing right now?

Yeah.

No.

Yeah, they don't even tell me that.

I'm so sorry, but I believe it's the case.

This is someone's first episode, someone's last episode.

Every, every episode is that, I believe.

Wow.

That's really true.

Yeah.

That's really true.

Every day somebody is born and somebody dies.

And then you don't want to be either.

Yeah.

Don't be the big character.

You don't want to be either.

Don't be the person who's born today.

You're already alive.

You're finding up the system.

As everyone knows, every day on earth, one person is born and one person dies.

It evens out every day.

Every day.

So what you're listening to is the best of Comedy Bang Bang.

Now what is Comedy Bang Bang if you've never heard of it before?

It's not this, what we're doing.

It's not this though.

Yeah, that's true.

That's a good point.

My name is Scott Augerman.

I'm the host of Comedy Bang Bang.

I do it every single week.

And on these best of episodes, and I, okay, this is our 13th best of- Are you?

Fagang, Kenny May?

Now, I don't know if you've joined me all 13 years.

Did you?

I think, I feel like, was there a year?

It feels like it for sure.

Was the second year, I know we didn't even do like a countdown the second year.

We just did like random clips.

I don't know.

Who knows if you've been here all 13 years.

I don't keep track of things where I'm not involved.

So I don't know.

I'm not the guy to answer that question.

So were you here all 13 years?

Yes.

You were as far as I know.

But with me co-hosting, and in his own persona, and I'll explain that in a little bit, we have of course comedian extraordinaire, rock-on-tour extraordinaire, stand-up comedian, action pictures.

Excuse me.

Writer, what?

I'm not a stand-up comedian extraordinaire.

I was going to say all those things and then hit extraordinaire at the end.

So I didn't have to say it every single time.

It seemed like you dropped the extraordinaire right as we got to the stand-up comedian.

Ify.

No, out of way.

Here he comes.

Hey, ify.

What's up, dude?

Oh, he's got to go.

Hey, no Jarls lately.

We'll talk about that.

We'll talk about Jarls.

We have to talk about Jarls.

Stand-up comedian extraordinaire, actor extraordinaire, writer extraordinaire, voice actor extraordinaire, you think you're iffy on the writer, is that the least of your skills?

Yeah.

I'm going to say yes.

All right.

You know what?

It's the thing I enjoy the least.

I'll give you that, but I feel like it's maybe my strongest skill.

And I enjoy the least.

I think you're a very good writer, but it's so hard to do.

Do you know what I realized recently?

Is that?

And we'll get to my name in a second.

That's my line.

My problem with writing is typing.

I'm a bad typist.

And that makes it a frustrating experience.

It makes everything I have to go back and fix like all the shit that I got wrong.

You know what I don't like is writing.

I kind of like rewriting.

So what I've tried to do recently is just get through the writing part of it as quickly as possible.

And as poorly as possible, you know, just like make it shitty and just get it out in a day.

And then you pretend somebody else wrote it and you're like, what?

No, I got to fix this.

This fucking idiot.

Who is he doing?

Or just make a friend of mine right at the first draft.

And the Tom Sawyer strategy is sure is fun.

Why do I just draft for me?

Oh, that's being done.

Hollywood all the time.

Oh, yes.

But, and I will get to his name right now.

Paul of Tomkins is joining me.

Hi.

Well, hi.

I say like the little cat near the refrigerator.

I don't know this cat.

You're not familiar with this cat?

No.

He's a little.

He's a cat who says hello like a southern gentleman.

A camera.

It's a fun video.

Camera gums around a corner and sees this cat that's next to the refrigerator and the cat looks at the camera and says, well, hi.

I don't know.

Is this a video?

Is this a meme?

What is this?

It's a video.

I think maybe it could be a meme.

Okay.

I haven't seen it.

We're fine.

Where can I check this out?

Is this on YouTube?

The tube of the people.

YouTube.

We the people.

This tube is for you.

If you went on YouTube and there was a big like, you know how when you go on anyone's Twitter and there's a big we the people like in the Constitution Fund, you know that they're the worst person in the world.

Absolutely.

What if that was YouTube?

We the people.

YouTube.

We give you videos of people trying to scare someone and then getting punched.

If that was all YouTube was?

Great.

I would be on it every day.

Me too.

I think it's my favorite.

Sure, I could be on it every day and just watch that and it would be fine.

Absolutely.

I think it's my favorite genre of YouTube video.

God.

America's funny is home videos.

If all right, they should have started YouTube.

Don't you think they had all the videos?

They should have started YouTube.

And you know what?

At the very least they should have sued YouTube.

Yes.

Saying I think we invented like someone having a video and like displaying it.

They should sue YouTube.

We invented the concept of people watching videos of people they don't know.

YouTube.

Why did they drop the home?

Because they call it A-H-no, A-F-V.

A-V-N right?

No, no, A-F-A-F-V.

A-V-A-V-V-Tro-Fo-V-V-V-V-N.

Yes.

IV-N.

I don't know.

I call it A-V-N.

Well, it's too complicated to have it be I...

What is it?

No, I'm thinking of ideas.

I before A.

People for A.

America's Funniest Videos.

Oh, funny.

It's not favorite.

No.

They all have to be funniest.

They're funny, but people don't like them?

Oh, a lot of people don't like them.

The most of that show is...

America's least favorite funniest home video.

You don't like them, but you got them and they're funny.

Funny is funny.

But you hate them.

Yeah.

You hate to admit that they're funny.

America's funniest home videos.

Yes, that was the original title when my man Bob Sageth hosted.

That's right.

And they did all the voices.

And now it's just...

But didn't they call it A-V?

I don't know.

We're never...

If only Lorne Lapas were here.

They've shortened it to America's Funniest Videos.

They just call it America's Funniest Videos now.

So they get rid of the H because it's...

Yeah, I don't know why they got rid of the H.

But they still...

They still...

God, people are screaming at their...

Good.

Let them scream their throats out.

At their wives right now.

And husbands.

I hope...

People are screaming at their spouses right now.

I hate you.

Like I hate these videos.

Turn this off.

Let me explain what this is that you're listening to.

Okay.

So Comedy Bang Bang is a podcast.

It's been around for over 12 years.

12 and a half now, I wish.

12 and 7 months.

And we've been going since 2009.

I've hosted it from the beginning and I took a little time off along the way.

And Paul hosted one or two as I recall.

And Jimmy Pardo hosted a couple.

Jerry Minor hosted a few.

That's right.

But I've been here since the beginning for the most part.

The majority, the preponderance of the podcast.

Oh, fuck.

Preponderance doesn't sound positive to me.

Yeah.

What does it sound like?

You got like you...

It sounds like too much.

Oh, it's too much.

Like a preponderance.

A lot of people would agree with that.

He was there for the preponderance.

God.

I want to talk to those people and say, you shut up.

Okay.

Here's a platform for you.

This is my YouTube.

I want to tell everyone who has a problem with anything that happens here on this show ever.

This is a safe space.

This should be.

It's the safest of spaces.

I'm a little snowflake, short and stout.

And I want to tell you to shut up, shut up, shut your little pig mouth.

You little pig.

You get disgusting little pig.

You rude thoughtless little pig.

That's what it was.

I couldn't quite get the phrasing right.

You thoughtless little pig.

That's probably the most famous thing that he's known for.

Oh, the Ruth on this little pig guy?

Yes.

Let's hook it up too lately.

Anyway, so this is a podcast we've been doing since 2009.

That's why I keep presenting.

And basically what it is is here's the format of the show.

Oh, good.

We never talk about this unless we're on the best ups.

If you're listening to a normal episode, we never break down and explain what the show is.

Break down and explain what the show is.

We never do that because we just want you to be immersed in it and have a good experience and then forget about it the minute you've impressed.

We want you to be a bunch of Jeremy Strong's and be immersed in the show.

You think it's reality.

And this is a real question.

Would he be as popular if his name was Jeremy Week?

I gotta say no.

It's a real flex calling yourself Jeremy Strong.

Absolutely.

And is it his real name?

It's like Hugh Jackman.

I've talked about this before.

He gave himself the name, Huge Jacked Man.

And he took out a couple of letters and he's just like Hugh Jackman.

Right.

He didn't think he could get away with it.

But no, we know what he's doing.

We see you Hugh Jackman.

We see you.

We're doing the Robert De Niro pointing eyes.

But Jeremy Strong, it's like, dude, come on.

What if his real name is Joshua Littleman?

I mean, compared to Greg, he is a little bit.

But everyone is compared to Greg.

Well, everybody's so tall.

Oh my gosh.

Do you know what I heard?

What?

He's still growing.

No!

Greg, cousin Greg is still growing.

He's gonna get bigger than that.

Would this show be more popular if it were a succession recap podcast?

Undoubtedly.

With Jeremy Strong.

Oh, undoubtedly.

Do you think he ever will?

Jeremy Strong hosting the rock.

He's a success.

Hosted a succession recap podcast where he talks about what happened during each episode.

Who would be the person who's gonna host that podcast?

Greg definitely will.

But he'll have to team up with someone.

He'd be the likeliest candidate.

I'm gonna say it's somebody who was on a bunch of episodes, but not all of them.

Like the guy, the bald guy or the bald guy.

He's like one of the business leaders.

Not Fisher Stevens.

Okay.

Who considered him a bald guy?

Yeah, he's got the Charlie Brown like lines drawn on it.

He's got a still college.

Right.

No, I forget the character's name.

Frank, maybe?

I don't know.

But Greg definitely will.

Maybe.

Do they get Kieran involved?

No.

No, he doesn't know.

I think of all the main cast, I think Greg is the most likely candidate, but I can't say for sure that he would.

Yeah.

But I would say like- I think he does it within the year.

I would say maybe Jerry.

Jerry and Greg.

Jerry and David rash.

Yeah, David rash.

Yeah.

Of course, he's got the comedy background, sledgehammer.

Of course, sledgehammer.

Multiple episodes of DAG.

Yes.

Paul F. Tomkins from TV's DAG.

Probably where people know me from.

Yes, that's right.

I'm the character Sullivan Pope.

But this probably, I was saying it'll happen in 2022.

It happens by March.

The rate at which these podcasts are happening is increasing.

There's just leaving money on the table.

It's like the gremlins.

Logan Roy wouldn't leave money on the table.

That's right.

Fuck you.

You fuck off.

You have a dick the size of a tiny dick.

Are you writing for the show?

I love that when they're not sure what to do.

They just end the scene with fuck off.

Yeah, fuck off.

All great plays should just use that as a project.

All great plays.

One day's journey and tonight, you should just be like fuck off.

Very last line.

Curtin.

They truly were all my sons.

Fuck off.

They truly were.

Isn't that the last line of all my sons?

Something like that.

Who knows?

I think it was.

I think that can't be true.

That's one of the plays that I remember having the title of the play be the last line.

But I could be wrong.

But the last line can't be, they truly were all my sons.

I think it's something very close.

All right, we're going to have to look this up.

Do you know the plot of all my sons?

No.

Okay.

You seem to bear us to say that.

It's about basically a war profiteer who has like three of his own sons.

All of them?

And he's rich.

Like he's a rich guy.

I hope so.

He's a war profiteer.

But he, then it comes out throughout the show that he, it's a lot like succession in a way, but it comes out throughout the show that basically he sent off faulty parts for airplanes or something like that.

And a ton of, a ton of people died.

And then he realizes at the end that they were all his sons.

Like not, he was, he was trying to protect his sons, but, but all of these kids who died were his sons.

This guy sucks.

Yeah, this guy sucks.

And I think that, I mean, I don't think the, the play is hiding that fact.

Let me tell you something.

If you're going to be a war profiteer and I, God love you, do what you want.

Sure.

But it's free country.

Be good at it.

You know what I mean?

Does it, does it, does it, does it, what, how does it hurt your body?

Bottom line, if you're, if you're sending them, like parts that work instead of faulty parts.

It does hurt the bottom line.

That's why he did it.

You find that out.

But how much, how much?

Millions and millions of dollars.

Did he just get greedy?

Uh, no.

In fact, he says I wasn't greedy at all.

He, I wasn't greedy at all.

This is an interestingly written play.

I'm not greedy.

I've got to get.

It truly were all my studies.

That's the very last one.

Star Wars, by the way.

Okay.

So.

Star Wars, by the way.

Greedo.

He's the greediest character.

Do you think it's just an unfortunate coincidence?

You see, but also is he really greedy or is he just doing his job?

He gots apples, holo.

Well, that's the thing is is like, okay, why call him Greedo when he's really just, yeah, he is doing his job, but he's, he's not out there like cheating anyone.

No.

He's, he's, he's about to shoot Han Solo for money.

For money.

He's been hired to do a job by Jabba the Hutt.

That's the other thing.

So Jabba, they call, so, so what's his name?

Skywalker?

No, Lucas.

He, he.

Are we talking about the movie Lucas?

Yes.

Okay.

Good.

Were they clap at the end?

They do a slow clap.

Now do you call that the brew baker clap or the Lucas clap or something else?

I call it the brew baker.

Okay.

I call it the Lucas because I think that's when I was aware of it.

Exactly.

I'm a little older than you.

Yeah.

So of course it would be the brew baker for me.

It would also be the Janet Jackson microphone or the Madonna microphone.

Or the Howard, for me, it's the Howard Jones.

Exactly.

For another generation, the Britney Spears.

Sure, of course.

Does anyone know what we're talking about?

Do a leapa?

I don't know.

One.

So, so Grito, I don't think it's that greedy.

He's not that greedy.

He's just doing his job.

So did, did Lucas call him that in order for us to know that he's a bad guy immediately?

All the names seem like shorthand of like, you know, like, Grito, you're not going to like him, so we'll call him Grito.

Like they should just call him like, well go.

When you see him, you'll want to like him, of course.

Call him Butterface.

I'm Butterface.

With Star Wars, it wouldn't be that much different than what it is.

No.

If there was a character named Butterface.

Robert Butterface approaches.

Lord Butterface.

But he's got to be really handsome and have a terrible body.

No one talks about Butterbods, do they?

Butterbods.

Let's get it into the conversation.

Let's get that going.

The first thing you show is a real Butterbod.

It's a shame.

It's a shame when you see a Butterbod.

It really, really is.

Okay, so the format of this show.

But Jabba was a hut.

So they call him Jabba, like jabbering.

You're not going to like him because he's like talking a lot.

Like a Jabba.

The hut.

He's a hut.

A hut, I guess, is like, it's a shit.

It's shittier than a house.

So that's like a clue that you're not going to like him.

Like, oh, he lives in a hut.

But no, he doesn't live in a hut.

No, I know he doesn't, but what I'm saying is Luke has called these characters intentional names so that you don't like them.

So do you think hut is a slam on the race of huts?

Like they're not as good as a house?

Yes.

I don't consider houses to be different races.

Right.

Well, but I'm saying hut is a race.

That's just me.

Hut is a race.

Yes, a hut is a race in Star Wars.

But I mean, I mean...

Motherfucker, did you think I was trying to say that houses are different races?

Yes.

No.

Is that your sentence was structured?

Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

Now, who am I?

Me?

Yes.

Okay.

Anyway, enough about Star Wars.

We'll get back to it later.

It's definitely going to happen.

By the way, call me up a little later on the show the most exciting.

Signing.

Call me up a little later on the show.

Let me know how you think it's going and if I should quit.

No, call me up a little later on the show.

We have the most exciting moments in podcasting.

We have, we'll have a visit from the snowman.

Oh, he's here.

Mr. Police, we gave you all the clues.

And now we're going to find out who you choose.

But here's the format of the show.

Okay, so every week when you listen to it, I'm the host.

I'm playing myself or at least a version of myself.

This also happens when you don't listen to it.

Yes.

So don't worry.

It's still going on.

We're not trying to give you a lesson in object permanence, but the show is still happening when you don't listen.

I'm the host.

I'm playing myself or a version of myself, the most annoying aspects of myself.

Do you ever drop the act?

You know, that's funny that they don't turn it around on me because I'm the one who doesn't drop the act.

Those guys actually are pleasant.

Although I would never say that to their face.

Oh my God, no.

On my.

And we'll cut this part out.

Yes, of course.

Yeah.

Devin, cut this out.

Fuck off.

But so I myself and then we most times, but not always, will have a celebrity on who's coming on to plug their latest project.

Sometimes maybe they're not there to plug their latest project.

They're there to be uncomfortably confused.

Yes.

90% of the time they don't know what's going on.

But so they'll be themselves over the over the past year we've had many and you'll hear a lot of them on this best of episode.

But then we have very talented comedians and improvisers who are playing fake people.

They're playing characters, as we say in the trade.

That is an industry term for fake people.

Yes.

Yeah.

And one that I believe we coined.

I don't think anyone ever said the word character before the comedy bang bang podcast.

You should sue Netflix for having that movie that's a cast of characters at the end.

That movie that's a cast of characters.

Do you say cast of characters?

Last night we saw a trailer for the there's another Downton Abbey movie, which I never heard about.

Like they secretly did this movie.

No, no, I've been I've been clogging it.

It's yeah, it's definitely been on the on my radar.

But at the end of the trailer, instead of listing the actors, they listed the characters.

They're like, all your favorites are back.

Like, yeah, I know Lord Grantham or whatever.

But let's say you have no idea what that is.

What is that going to mean?

Well, if you have no idea, you'd be looking at that going, who's this movie star Lord Grantham?

Is this a documentary?

The Dowager Countess is in this.

I'm excited though.

Do you like those movies?

Do you like the show?

I mean, they're good.

I think that show is such.

It's just comfort food.

It's comfort food.

I love like that period visually for me is like it's a sweet feast.

It's a some to a feast.

It's a some to a feast for the I.

I came out of the last movie saying like they could just make one of these every two years and I'd be very happy.

Yeah, what else do they have to do?

Yeah, what else is anyone doing?

The only thing I need is Lord Grantham to do double duty and make a pattington three.

Yes, we need pattington three.

We need to be three.

I thought they were making a pattington three.

They fucking better be one and two.

Two the best one to punch of fake bear movies.

I saw two.

Yeah, because they never made a sequel to The Edge.

I saw those real bear.

That was fake.

That was real bear.

I saw we saw pattington two first and then eventually we were going to we're like we should watch pattington.

How was one hold up then if you've seen like two is it's still great?

Yes.

Two is two is a little more simple.

Absolutely.

Two is two is really something special but one is like a delightful movie.

Paul, this is not a movie podcast is it?

Because I feel like people are getting confused.

Oh, fine.

Are we not even allowed to talk about movies?

Are we alive?

Are we are we ourselves?

Am I dead?

So people play characters.

They come on the show and we improvise the show.

A lot of people say we've talked about over the years on the best.

Oh, yes.

There's not enough there's not enough confusion.

There's not any confusion anymore.

But there's just enough confusion.

People say like how much is planned out and I think 95 to 98 percent of the time nothing is planned out.

I think less and less as it goes on.

Yes, definitely.

I think earlier in the the early years because it was coming off of a live show.

Like 12 AD.

Sure.

Because it was based on a live show that I was producing at the UCB theater.

I knew people's acts really well and they would come on to the show that I was doing and they would play characters.

And so a lot of the times in the early years it was like, hey, do that bit that you've perfected on stage and I'll just set you up.

But these days it's all purely like sometimes the performer knows what they're going to do.

Sometimes they don't and we'll talk about that a little later.

Sometimes they just have a name and they're just find it in the moment.

Exactly.

But it's conversational improv.

We talk to these characters, we find out what their hopes, dreams, where they're going after they die.

Yeah, exactly.

That's a big part of the show.

Existence of God.

But now we talk to the characters and we just try to find out what their deal is.

That's essentially.

And that's the format of the show and it's been going for now over 12 years and that is what you're listening to and Paul is one of our most treasured guests.

One of the only four who have been on the show every single year of its existence.

Wow.

That's right.

And the number keeps dwindling.

I believe Lauren dropped off the list this year.

That's Sam.

Well, she had her baby.

Was she on in the first year?

I don't know.

Maybe she.

Yeah.

She couldn't have been on the list.

She was more.

But this was the first year since she started doing the show.

She was still a babysitter.

Yeah.

At that point.

And then suddenly she was a movie star.

That's right.

And got on this show.

Exactly.

That's a three to men's side.

It's the babysitter to comedy bag bag pipeline.

So many babysitters out there are dreaming of being on this show.

I know, but only.

They're not even interested in comedy.

Only three can make it.

No one even wants to be in comedy.

They're just out there.

If you're a babysitter, you probably will end up on comedy.

What if that was a reality show?

A reality competition where it's babysitters are competing to get on this show?

And what do they have to do?

Because they're still babysitters.

There's still babysitters.

So they can't be doing improv.

That would be a good, I mean, I would like that more than, because when you say like, oh, comedy bag do a reality show, like no one ever would.

But if they were to say it, it would be like, okay, yeah, we'll like have a competition with comedians.

I like it way better just taking like babysitters.

Absolutely.

And one babysitter.

And one or the winner gets to be on an episode of Comedy Bag Bang.

I love it.

I love it too.

Here's, they cannot be interested.

No.

Well, that's the one rule.

They won't be.

But we should put that in writing.

Yeah, they can't be.

They cannot be interested and in fact, may even not want to accept the prize.

What if there's a scandal and one is secretly interested?

Oh, yeah.

It's basically like on the Bachelorette when, you know, one of the guys comes on there, like you had a girlfriend when you came on, you just wanted to be on TV.

What?

You didn't know this happens, ball?

No.

People have secret boyfriends and girlfriend.

Happens more than once?

Yes, it happens all the time where people are like, and they always, this is how they react.

They're looking for love.

This is how they react every single time.

Oh, I mean, we'd like, you know, message each other a couple of times.

Every time.

We message each other because they know messages will come out.

And so that's their first line of defense of like, oh, we message each other.

But we're not like, I mean, we're not.

I mean, we said maybe we'd meet up.

Oh, I mean, yeah, we met up five times.

Well, we were, I mean, we got married.

Yeah, that's a photo of our families all standing together.

Toasting us at the altar.

Do you watch the show every year?

Yeah, I believe I've seen every episode, although I do fast forward through the dates.

Usually.

Why?

Because I'm not really that interested in whatever dumb shit.

You just want to see the dynamic of all these weirdos together.

Yeah.

That's what I'm interested in.

I don't really care.

But you want to see two idiots try to have a conversation.

Yes.

Especially because they've just like they always put down a plate of food in front of them.

But you know, they've just eaten.

Right.

And so they've just eaten and had a real probably interesting conversation, but because they don't want people eating on camera, then they're like, okay, now we're turning the cameras on.

You want some food, don't eat it.

Here's your beef stroganoff.

And then they have their fake TV conversation or whatever is.

Basically, it's whatever the person who is competing for love has whatever tragedy that person is under God that they feel like they need to say in order to make themselves seem deep.

Right.

And they do that on every date.

Every date.

That's the formula for every day.

So I don't know if you heard this yet, but my parents died in a mining accident.

You're the fifth date.

Blood demons.

I don't know how much you guys talk.

Blood.

They're trying to save some blood diamonds from blood diamond mine.

They were trying to save them like.

Yeah.

There's people.

You think they're people out there.

People out there batting blood diamonds out of people's hands.

Yeah.

Back into the mine.

Somebody's trying to.

Yeah.

So it's a necklace.

It's a smash.

It's a match.

Put that down.

Hey, look, if you're wearing blood diamonds right now, I'm mad at you.

Yeah.

Paul's mad.

He's doing on record saying that if you're wearing blood diamonds, he's a little peeved at you.

Yeah.

I'm mad.

Yeah.

Or at least annoyed.

Yeah.

I'm ticked off and you have to go a long way to make it up to me by giving you some blood diamonds.

I love them.

Okay.

You got me.

I love blood diamonds.

I want your blood diamonds.

If you have blood diamonds out there, send them care of comedy banging.

But if George Michael had sung, I want your blood diamonds instead of a rest of development.

Well, remember when it was funny that you could name a character in your thing after a famous person and go like, oh, I'm not the real one.

Michael Bolton.

Yeah.

That was funny.

That was his name.

That was really.

That was funny.

And it was funny on a rest of development.

And then every single script you received had it in there.

I kind of forgot about that on a rest of development.

Yeah.

I fell off.

You did.

And here's the proof.

You're explaining your computer.

You can use face.

Tell the whole story.

But did it come up?

Did they do it after the first season?

Call him his name?

No, did it like the idea of other people hearing his name and then?

Oh, I don't even know if it had if it was even pointed to in the first episode.

I think it was just like a thing.

It was just so funny that his name was George Michael.

I don't I think they just said and how George they just like you were in your in your to it after the first episode.

And the idea was like isn't it funny his name is I'm getting mad at this.

Okay.

Go ahead.

Say your speech.

Get it off your chest Paul.

By the way, this comes up a little later in one of I believe it's in one of our clips.

Is it okay to say get it off your chest these days?

Are you asking me or do you want to wait till we hear the clip?

Let's wait till we hear the clip.

Okay.

And it might be in one of our first.

I do have my answer though.

Okay.

Let me up a little later.

If you're going to tell me that you live in a world where office space already exists.

Yeah.

The famous Michael Bolton scene.

Change his name.

Very funny.

Good movie.

You then think not only are you going to name a character after a famous person in your TV show, a TV show not a movie.

This is going to go the if you if you like for multiple seasons and it did and it did and then they did something on Netflix.

Then and you're not even going to like address the fact that he has the thing.

Do you think the character should have turned to camera and said like by the way, we know this happened in office space?

That's exactly what they should have done.

But we're not going to address it and then back to the show.

I don't think they ever did it like off.

I think it was different.

I think it was executed differently where he had just his name was George Michael and no one ever said like oh like the singer or anything.

And it was supposed to be funny that his name was George Michael.

Yeah.

That's subtle.

So I don't know.

I don't know.

It's been quite a few years since I've seen that.

Was funny at the time, but I haven't revisited it.

Doubt I'll get to it again before I die.

That show was fat.

Funny at the time.

Let's get that going.

P H A T.

Oh, it can't be.

Funny.

We know.

Funny.

Um, have I explained the show?

Yeah.

Who cares?

Yeah.

There's nobody that is never listening to this that is still listening.

I mean, I don't know.

I don't think so.

I think a lot of people get into the show from the best.

We've talked about that earlier on the show.

So just take a creeper shot of me.

No, I'm pulling my notes.

God, what if that was what if like after I pass away everyone goes through my my phone and I'm just taking like it's filled with creeper shots apart.

Filled.

That's why you have me on this long day every year.

Yes.

More pictures.

By the way, we're taping all of these.

This is the first of four episodes.

I'm covering for Paul blowing his nose.

You're not hearing it.

But this is the first of four episodes we'll be doing.

One will cut.

You're listening to the one that came out today.

Another will come out this Thursday, another one week from today and another our final fourth episode a week from this Thursday.

We are going to be counting down.

How many episodes do you think we're counting down this year?

300.

No, we did not even.

It's actually lower.

299.

I'm not going to do that to you.

This is right me.

200.

100.

Lower.

99.

Now you're writing me.

No.

No, we're counting down 15 episodes this year, Paul.

Top 15.

We put out if I had to guess we put out 53 this.

No, no, no, no, no, 51 because then we also did the best.

So I think we put out 51 episodes, 51 regular episodes if I'm guessing correctly.

And we're counting the top 15.

And by the way, this is all based on you, the listeners votes.

We put up a poll around Thanksgiving and everyone chimed in and every single person in the world.

Great turnout.

It was crazy.

Better than the general election here in the United States.

It was insane.

And who's the general now?

I didn't need a general now.

Call it maybe Shacklehead to the phone.

Shock?

Shock.

Shock or shirt?

Shock.

Yeah, maybe Chacklehead to the phone.

I clearly said Shaq.

Oh, Shaq.

Oh, you said shock.

I said Shaq.

Thank you.

Devin, who pays your salary?

Not me.

I want to find out.

It's me.

Because I want them to fire you.

I do it.

What?

I'm paying Devin's salary this whole time.

I'm in this all time.

Yes.

How nice of you.

It's a Christmas miracle.

It by the way is today is the 20th of December.

And that's and by the way, wet weather, pelting the Southland today as we take this.

Torrential rain.

We got torrential rain coming down later on more of the same when we get our board.

I don't have an point to flat hand fist point flat and fist.

Go back about five years to hear us talking about five years.

That's a weird insult.

Why don't you tell me that?

Why don't you go back about five years?

Go pop yourself, you blister.

If you're out there, listen.

That was a West Side Story last night.

If you're out there listening, you got to sell it.

But say that to someone and see what they'll probably act like it was a mean insult.

Absolutely.

Because if you say it with, if you sell it, you got to say it with the right cadence.

Hey, why don't you go back about five years?

Let's try do it to me.

I'll say something that you don't like.

Okay.

Don't.

I'm not actually going to hurt your feelings.

I'm going to say, what are you going to do?

I'm just running it by me.

I'm going to say you were in a play and it didn't seem like you were well cast.

Who are you?

She's actually said this to me.

Pick something else.

Pick something.

Well, I know I'm not my mother because I would have told you that you spoke too fast.

And that would be your only review of the play.

Okay.

Let's say you got, let's say you're trying long hair.

Like you grew your hair out.

It's a little close to home.

God, you're never going to come a little close to home.

Okay.

Let's say you're wearing color contacts.

I might do that at some point.

So we should stay with you.

I'm going to show you with blue eyes everywhere.

It's color contacts.

That's a great song.

Is it a great song?

That's a great song.

At least a great song title.

Great song title.

But the song is terrible.

What a genre.

Do you think that song is?

What genre is there a genre of terrible songs with the best titles?

Can you think of one right now?

I know there are a bunch of morsey ones where I go like, oh man, that the song did not live up to like, let me look up this one right now.

But that's like all of his songs are like the titles are these big grand things and they can't always match up.

I think lifeguard sleeping girl drowning is a great song title.

It's like a Gary Larson cartoon.

Gary Larson, if you're out there, why don't you collaborate with morsey?

Gary, you should have done it.

That's like one of those.

That's like a play where they imagine these two people that never met getting together.

Right.

In the afterlife.

Well, there's some play now.

It's a musical that's about three famous people who did like acid therapy in the 60s.

All of them getting together for a weekend in Malibu and trimming home.

I'm doing more at Aldous Huxley, Carrie Grant and Claire Luce Booth.

Who's Claire Luce Booth?

I know.

A muse-boosh, is it that?

Claire, right?

She is an appetizer.

She is a living appetizer.

Okay.

Also, she's still alive.

No one's eaten her yet.

No, she was a playwright who became, did she become like an activist or something?

Hmm.

Yeah.

But this play, this musical, is like what if these people got together and tripped balls and musicals as well?

There's nothing more depressing than you're enjoying something like a song or I look, there's a lot more depressing than this.

Let me be honest.

Stick to your guns.

All right, there's nothing more depressing.

This is the most depressing thing.

Anyone can ever think of.

But you're listening to a song you're enjoying or you're seeing a performance in a movie you like and then you're like, wow, I'm just enraptured by this and you look them up on Wikipedia and find out they're a total piece of shit in real life.

Yeah, always go to controversy first.

Personal life in controversy.

Yeah.

I was enjoying a song.

I'm just thinking on Prince's Wikipedia page.

Yes.

Is there a controversy?

Is it all about the album?

It's just a link to a single.

No, but that wasn't the name of the album, right?

What was the name of the album?

It was.

I think it had like all the newspaper clips.

Yeah, yeah.

It was both a song and an album.

There we go.

One of his, let's see if we can list the song titles that were actual albums by Prince.

Oh shit.

Purple Rain.

Dirty Mind.

Oh.

Sino of the Times.

Around the world in a day.

Uh, Prince.

Batman was not.

It was bad dance.

Prince was not hit.

My name is Prince.

He did not call it.

Diamonds and pearls.

I'm Prince.

The big symbol.

No, he never did a song.

I never did a song.

I would love to hear him try to pronounce it.

Oh my God.

Prince come back to life for pronounce it.

He was a coward.

That's why he died.

Um, I forget why we were talking about this.

Anyway.

Oh, yeah.

I'll show we get to this.

Oh, it was the most depressing.

There's nothing more depressing.

Oh, yeah.

I was, I was, who was it?

I was, I was enjoying a song and I looked her up and it was like, she was a famous singer in the 50s who became an anti gay activist.

I was just like, Oh, fuck.

And you don't know, like it's, it's better to be in blissful ignorance.

Exactly.

Or maybe it's not.

Maybe it's better to know and say like, well, I don't know.

Well, you know, the problem with blissful ignorance is that you might go shooting your mouth off like this person's great.

That's true.

And then you're talking to someone whose life was destroyed.

Should, should, should you Wikipedia anyone you ever talk about?

For sure.

Yeah.

Definitely.

You like you get, I think you should be able to interrupt a conversation.

So you know what?

Before I say this, let me do a quickie search on my googoo glasses.

Googoo glasses.

On my googoo glasses.

I would wear them if they call them googoo glasses.

For sure.

They did it still around, right?

No, no, but I, but isn't face, I thought is meta, meta, metaverse face plan.

Yes.

That's what people would do when they wore their googoo glasses because they trip over there.

Exactly.

I'm going to say crack at the sidewalk and break them in the pack.

Break your fucking neck.

Anyway, let's get to it.

You ready to start this countdown?

You ready to go on this one last adventure?

Yes, I have a reputation.

Did you say one last adventure?

We're never doing this again?

No, we should do it one more time.

Yes.

One last adventure before the end of the year though, you have to agree on that.

Let's get to it.

Let's get to the first episode.

Let's get to the first episode that we're going to be listening to a clip.

By the way, we're listening to clips of the episode.

By the way, we're listening to clips of the episodes.

Let's get to it.

This is your episode 15.

Number one, five.

Okay, so this, this, by the way, this deserves a little explanation.

Yes.

Yeah.

In previous years, we have said, Paul, that you and I are going to rerecord these jingles that we've been using since the very first year.

Yeah.

I even proposed we get like a stable of, of comedy bang all stars, a stable of D.

Comedy bang bang all stars.

Who can sing?

Who can sing.

Yeah.

And we even one who can't.

One.

And we all just like glare at them.

Yeah.

After everyone.

It doesn't really hurt the thing.

But, and we record all the numbers.

We record like a bunch of numbers.

Little backgrounds, 13 years ago when we did the first one of these best ofs.

I really wanted the, you know, I was inspired by the radio countdowns that I grew up with in the, in the 1980s.

They were very inspiring.

Of, you know, every week you'd listen to the top 40 countdown and they'd have these jingles that they paid for number one and all that.

You just heard it.

So the engineer who was working with us at the time, we scoured the internet.

I believe I found these on a website that you could download.

And all it is is numbers one through 10.

And we couldn't find any that were like through 40.

And so, so when you're hearing this, it, we don't have the actual number 15.

So we have to do number one, five.

Whoever these people are, they could not predict a countdown going higher than 10.

So, but every year I know we talk about we're going to rerecord these and we ask for you to remind us about two months out, I believe.

Thank you.

You know what?

And a lot of people did.

I'm going to say three.

Oh, no, they did.

Yes.

A lot of people did.

We got, we got your messages.

A lot of people said, Hey, this is just to let you know that you need to record these.

And here's the other thing.

I did not ask Devin about it.

Devin's a musician, our producer Devin.

He's a musician.

He could have helped us.

Absolutely.

He's big nod from Devin.

Big nod.

I could have.

Devin is very agreeable in that way.

But the one time it was on my mind and I mentioned it, I happen to be over at our good friend engineer Brett's house recording a different show.

Let me pick up that name.

He just dropped.

Sorry.

I know he's very famous.

And I casually threw it out there hoping he would jump on it like, Oh, that's a cool idea.

He could not have been less disinterested in helping with that could not have been less disinterested.

So, so he was so very interested.

No, he was slightly more disinterested.

He was still way there on the disinterested scale, but he was slightly.

He was probably thinking, I'm not going to jump at this because I have plenty of shit to do already.

Yeah, probably.

But, you know, I mean, it's kind of fun.

Why do you why do any of this unless it's fun?

Here's why do anything.

Unless it's fun.

I remember that I went there was a guy that I watched one time, a comedian that I worked with who a segue back in the day.

It seemed very important to have segues for your comedy bits.

Yeah.

Like you couldn't just end one bit and then started another bit about something else.

Or else I guess the audience was kind of like screaming, clotherizing.

Well, you know, some people do it really artfully.

I was watching a special the other day for a guest that's coming up in our new year.

And it's me being a guy who kind of has seen a lot of stand up over the years.

I'm very interested in how people put things together.

Right.

What's your favorite special of mine?

Driving drunk?

What is it called?

Yeah, driving drunk.

Anyway, go ahead.

Driving drunk.

Well, what was it?

Driving while crying?

Crying and driving.

Okay.

That's a good thing.

It's a driving while crying and driving.

That's a great special.

If you have not seen Paul's specials, they're out there.

They're available now.

Absolutely.

But Paul, you have to admit I've seen all of your specials numerous times over the years in person, like not the actual taping.

Have you though?

Every bit you've ever done.

I believe I've seen every bit.

Come on.

I think I have.

Every stand a bit you've ever created.

You think you've seen all of them?

I believe I've seen all of them.

You know that when you used to do, because you would do 20 to 30 minutes at death ray every month or every six weeks at least.

Oh, time ago, dear.

Yeah, but...

Long ago.

We only stopped doing that in 10 years ago.

Yeah, 10 years ago this month.

10 years of the long time, honey.

And you've done stand up since then?

Maybe I haven't seen it.

No, but I've seen your variety shows and all that.

Anyway...

Test me.

I'm not going to...

I'm not going to complete any of your punch lines.

My punch lines.

Yeah, I'll do the punch line to any setup you give me.

But that's not my...

To my material.

Wait, so anyway, segues.

Knock knock.

Give me...

My punch.

Okay.

Give me one of your jokes.

Knock knock.

Because...

Who's there?

Is that it?

That's exactly right.

Are you not just a plastic man?

You know your shit.

I apologize.

I shouldn't have doubted you.

Super fan of me.

Anyway, so you saw...

I was working with this guy who had a segue in his act.

You're not talking about the segue segue.

Yeah, he was on a segue.

Has there been a segue comedian yet?

Probably.

And he has terrible segues.

Probably.

He refuses to do segues in between his jokes.

This guy was doing some bit about cats and then he said, why do people have cats?

This is the end of the cat bit.

After like the end.

He got the big laugh.

That's like the big question.

To launch your bit.

Why do people have cats?

Well, but that...

He already talked about how ridiculous cats are.

Right.

He gets the laughs and he's like, why do people have cats?

Why do people do anything?

Because of this.

I don't remember.

Why do people do anything?

It was about a completely different subject.

And it did not.

Like the segue didn't help.

Why do people do anything?

Anyway, so this one guy.

Oh, now we're in.

So for the audience, like you hear it.

And you're like, oh, okay, now we can go anywhere.

Good.

But it also makes them feel so depressed about their own lives of like, you're right.

Why do people do anything?

Why are we here?

Why am I watching this idiot?

Just slither throat.

He was a nice guy though.

I wonder if he's still alive.

Oh, I hope so.

I hope everyone's still alive.

He's ever been alive.

What a beautiful bitch.

Hey, if you're out there, I hope you're still alive.

And I hope that said don't be born again.

No, we've discussed this.

Yeah.

Although that being born again now has...

I'm going to say people should remind us in the summertime to record the numbers.

Okay, that's what we were talking about.

Remind us in the summertime.

We'll get it done next year.

I swear.

Next year we will have these done.

You will not have to hear these shitty...

I mean, I don't think it's...

No, shade on them.

No, shade on them, but I bet none of them are still alive.

No, they're dead for sure.

They're all dead.

They're dead for sure.

You're just listening to like a haunted jingle this entire time.

My God, we'll get it for that.

Because there's more to come.

All right, so this is episode 15, Paul.

Sure.

And as usual, I'm going to give you the episode number and the date in which it was released.

And then I'll give you a title and we'll see if it rings any bells.

Okay, so first I guess with just the date and the episode number.

Yeah.

And then I'll give you the title.

A little hint of the title, yes.

Okay, great.

Okay.

All right, this is episodes 716.

So it's in the 716s.

It's right on the money on that in that regard.

Right in the middle of 716s.

It's actually at the beginning of the 716s.

Oh, true.

So 716.000000000016.

16.000000002.

Okay.

July 26th of 2021.

Summertime.

About when in the year people should have been sending us reminders.

Yes.

So keep that in mind for next year.

And what am I guessing?

What episode this is?

This was that.

I know this one.

You had, it was a great lineup.

Everybody was laughing and having a great time.

Yes, you are right about that.

But I'm going to need you to be a little more specific.

All right, well, give me the title.

I'll give you the title.

Meemaw and them.

I know this one.

You know this one and Paul, tell us how you know this one.

Because I'm on this one.

You are on this one starting the countdown off strong.

This is an episode that features Paul of Tompkins.

Do you remember the other guests?

I think Susie Barrett?

No.

No, no, no.

I'm thinking of a different episode.

Katie.

Katie Rich.

And promoting her book.

Casey Wilson.

Yes.

People will know from Black Monday and the Shrink next door, which is out currently.

And fan of the Opera episode of the Comedy Banguine TV show.

Yes.

If you may have seen the three of us watching West Side Story last night, if you saw us last night.

If you saw us last night, that's what we were doing.

So don't bother telling our spouses.

They know.

And they were upset.

Yeah.

We're in trouble.

So this is from July this year actually.

And Casey was on talking about her book, which by the way, her book, a great memoir named the wreckage of my presence.

And it's a point of contention that I have not read it between the two of us.

Are you in the special things?

I may be.

She may have mentioned me in the book.

And I might be in the special things.

You're in the special things.

You haven't read it.

That is a sin.

But if you're not in there, fuck that.

That's true.

I'll look in the trash.

She was very upset that we went on vacation together recently.

And I actively read five books in front of her.

That's right.

One was not her.

So Casey was on talking about her book.

And I guess we'll talk about it after you hear the clip about why this all came to pass.

But now this is the aforementioned character.

Paul F.

What character are you playing?

JW Stillwater.

JW Stillwater, which is a character of your own creation.

Whom you premiered.

From the twisted mind of me.

You premiered live on stage at the riot festival here in Los Angeles many years ago.

In costume.

In costume in a great episode that had our friend Harris Whittles on it as well as Lauren I think was on that episode as well.

That was a great episode.

You can listen to that in the comedy bang bang archives exclusively at CBBworld.com.

And I didn't know anything about that character.

And it's just taken fire.

And become a fan favorite.

And there's a reason why he's on this episode.

I'll just let you listen to it.

This is what you voted on America and beyond.

Say it like that.

It's your fault.

That's what I meant.

Here we go.

Let's listen to it.

This is your episode 15.

Number one five.

Let's get to this concert and citizen.

I'm a citizen.

Welcome to the concerned citizen.

Hello.

Thank you for having me on your program.

It's my pleasure.

You're a concerned citizen or are you?

Yes, I'm very concerned.

Are you from around these parts?

No, sir.

I'm from coming back to county Florida.

And I have a concerned citizen.

There's something that is guiding America right now that people need to tell about.

Oh, okay.

Well, get a load off your chest here.

Can we still say that?

Get a load off your chest?

I don't know.

It sounds dicey to me.

I prefer you not mention chests.

Chests and loads on them.

I don't know.

I don't like it.

Not in today's world.

I don't like it either.

Is that what you're concerned about?

No.

Okay, I'm glad.

I'm putting that one in my back pocket because I heard about it later.

Well, please tell us what you're concerned about, sir.

Can I call you sir or do I?

My name is Eddie Lee Capers.

You may prefer to be Eddie Lee.

Eddie Lee Capers.

That's great.

Ringing some sort of a belfer.

Go ahead.

Where are you concerned about Eddie Lee?

I'm concerned about this motion picture coming out of Hollywood, cold, still water.

I am urging people not to see this movie.

Still water.

The movie is coming out this Friday.

Matt Damon is in this.

If you say so, sir.

You don't want to be concerned about it.

I don't keep tabs on Hollywood celebrities.

This is a movie.

It's not celebrity.

I've been concerned about the movie.

This is the product that the celebrity's made.

That's right.

So you don't keep tabs on that either?

I just keep tabs on the product.

I don't keep tabs on the people.

But it's coming out this Friday.

It's not a break.

Can we agree on that?

I don't want to disagree with that, sir.

You said if I say so.

But you know what's coming out this Friday.

I said if you say so about Matt Damon.

Okay.

So, man, I'm sorry.

You think it's misleading?

It's very misleading by the title.

It's called still water.

It's not about still water.

The most people assume it's about.

What do you talk about?

I can't believe I got to walk you through this.

But most people would assume it's about the vigilante superhero.

JW is still water from coming back to Canada, Florida.

Oh, that's right.

I forgot about that guy.

He's a hero and noble man.

And I do not want his name dispersed by this Hollywood nonsense.

Okay.

See, JW still, are you looking at JW still water?

Okay.

Yeah.

Are you all right, sir?

I'm not.

You're not sick, I hope.

No, I'm not fine.

You're not fine.

I'm fine.

I'm not sick.

I'm just talking about Dorals being a voice that I always talk about.

Look up JW still water.

Oh, okay.

I'm finding him because I too wasn't sure.

You didn't know who JW.

Well, it took him in it for me to even remember who it is.

I think you paid.

This is everybody knows JW still water is.

Okay.

So JW, John Wesley, still water, AKA Eddie Lee Capers, is a character.

Played by.

Wait a minute.

Cut that part out.

Okay.

Sorry.

Also cut that part out.

Wait, cut this part out?

Two parts need to be cut out.

Which one needs to be cut out?

Or one long part.

Maybe cut out to one long part.

No, I'm not cutting anything out.

Okay.

You're JW still water is a vigilante from Cumberbatch County, Florida vigilante hero who has a cape, which is the Florida state.

Beautiful cape.

That's Florida state flag.

That's Florida state.

What if states had.

Florida has you to decide on a cape.

There's five flags are the same thing.

No, they're not.

You may as well just design capes.

That's what I'm saying.

Yeah.

That's what I'm saying.

We're agreeing.

We are.

I know.

You went high.

We like each other.

I know we do.

Well, look, he is a vigilante who who hero sorry who is out there searching for a hammer that was stolen.

I think he's not just searching for a hammer.

He's also patrolling the not you wouldn't say streets of Cumberbatch County, but more of the marshes in the bog.

That's right.

That's because he's because the police say there's a corrupt.

He has a fan boat.

Is that right?

He does have a thing.

What do you do for a living, sir?

I'm a fan boat mechanic, sir.

And your name is Eddie Lee.

Eddie Lee capers.

That's correct, sir.

As I recall and I haven't talked to JW.

You still want.

Okay.

I haven't talked to JW still water in a long time, but as I were.

When you talk to, you're lucky.

I am lucky.

Not just for talking to him, but for the mostly for that.

Right.

But I wish I could talk to that guy.

As I recall, he had he he he had a secret identity that he kept mentioning.

You haven't nobody knows it.

He kept mentioning the name.

He'd probably try to throw you off the trail.

And I think it was something like Van Haele.

Like Eddie Van Haele.

Eddie Van Haele.

Wait a minute.

No.

It was Eddie Lee capers.

No.

You were staking.

Eddie Lee capers.

No.

Wrong.

Eddie Lee capers.

Did you?

You are JW still water.

You are the week he's late.

Goodbye.

It's a good reference.

Thank you.

Points for that.

Wow.

Okay.

Good night.

More and more complex.

This is Casey.

Okay.

I don't know if you know what's going on, but this guy.

This guy actually is JW still water defending himself.

Defending himself.

Defending him.

Clear your throat, sir.

Talking your natural voice.

Give me your throat.

Let me get rid of whatever's in there.

All right.

You happy?

I am happy.

This is my regular voice.

Wow.

Are you or are you not JW still water?

No, I'm Eddie Lee capers.

Fambo mechanic.

Put on that mass business next to you.

Well, there's one right here.

Sure.

All right.

And now who are you?

I'm JW still water.

Look, I'm here.

I'm taking the mask off.

Okay.

I'm here in my capacity as a concerned citizen.

I don't want people to see this movie because it's about what is it about?

It's about a Hollywood.

God goes to friends.

It's not about a Hollywood guy.

That could not be less about a JW still.

It's like an oil rig guy.

But a Hollywood person is playing.

Although that's not the prologue of the movie where it's like five minutes of Matt Damon getting into makeup and playing this guy.

I mean, it might as well be.

Now, do you like my movie?

Y'all ought to have in all your movies.

Y'all have the dinner where you talk about wanting to do the movie.

That you know, I mean, when you get to a movie theater early, like 45 minutes early, you know, because you want to save your seat and they're showing like three minutes.

They're the you you staff to, but and they show the trivia and all that kind of stuff.

Wouldn't it be better just to show like Matt Damon getting into makeup for 45 minutes?

Or saying like, I don't know.

I don't think I want to do this.

It doesn't feel like it's going the way I want it and the back of the whole.

Can we replace the director like all of that kind of stuff?

I'd rather see that.

The one move I ever saw there was a race between a sprite and Coca-Cola and sprite one.

You could knock me over with a feather.

You think Coca-Cola would one because I have caffeine in it.

Sure.

Well done.

Was that the movie you saw or you saw something after that?

I thought that was the movie.

You walked out after that?

I thought that was the movie.

Were you satisfied?

I mean, it was pretty good.

I was.

You felt like you got your name.

It's Brian one.

That was right down there.

Caffeine and it's the Coca-Cola seven up.

It is lemon lime though.

Am I right on that?

Great.

So what did you think you were going to see?

Do you recall?

I just thought it was a movie.

I would just it just said a movie out there on the market.

Yeah.

Someone said, I'll friend of mine.

I said, sure, I'll go with the movies.

I never been.

And we went to the movie and then we saw it and it was exciting.

Did your friend walk out to?

Sort of and you thought.

I don't know if my friend walked out because it was dark in there.

And then I got out there.

He wasn't out there and I never saw him again.

He was his friend.

Do you think something happened to him in the movie?

The movie paddles.

Hello fan boat.

Where did you know?

He sells canoes.

Okay.

He did.

Oh, oh.

Where did he go?

Did you have the adjoining business next to yours?

Or like on boat row or something?

I don't know.

So Eddie Lee, I'm sorry the movie's coming out, but I mean, I realize that you're boycotting it, but I am hereby boycotting this movie.

Even though I do not go to the movies and I've only seen the one where Coke versus Sprite.

I will not see this movie as I will not see any movie from now on.

Okay.

Well, let's make it equal to the Coke versus Sprite movie.

Is your anger targeted at Matt Damon at all?

Well, I mean, in so much as he is a Hollywood celebrity, yes, but I don't like someone like him being in a movie called Stillwater because from what I understand he's very popular.

People going to go see him and they're going to assume his name is Stillwater and they're going to see the characters name.

It's got to be.

Why would you call it that?

There's never been a Matt Damon movie where I've walked out of it saying, I don't know who Matt Damon is anymore.

I just know that guy.

Okay.

See, this is how dumb you think everybody outside of Hollywood is.

You thought I thought people was going to think that Matt Damon isn't Matt Damon anymore.

Yeah, that is.

That's not what I was going to say.

No, that he's going to make people think he is playing this character Stillwater.

He is, but no, that's not the real Stillwater is my point.

You're a frustrating man.

You can't copyright it.

I've only met you the one time, but you drive me crazy.

What if the Fast and Furious movies were about Coke versus Sprite?

I'd see them.

They'd be good, right?

Yeah, sure.

What are they about now?

They're about a kind of an air-sats family of street racers.

A war, apparently.

They're a family that they're not related by blood.

They're just like friends, but they consider themselves to be a family.

Just like you and me and Scott.

Yes.

Cool up.

Yes, exactly.

Yeah.

Currently, they race cars and they pull off heists and they...

I would love to see Sprite and Coke in a rematch.

The Fast and the Furious.

That's right.

The Fast and the Furious, they presented Hobbs and Shaw.

Maybe they could present Fast and Furious presents Coke versus Sprite.

Okay, I mean, I don't know what any of that is, but okay.

Why didn't they...

And this is what I was talking to another guest about this.

Why didn't Fast and the Furious present Fast 9?

It's a perfect opportunity, a perfect tie-in.

It's Fast 9.

It's F9.

Sorry, F9 the Furious saga.

What?

Never mind.

Can I ask one more thing?

So you...

Please!

You can ask me anything you like.

Sir, you keep saying that you're afraid that upon everyone seeing the movie Stillwater, they're going...

It's going to besmirch the name of a person's Stillwater, correct?

That's right.

That's correct.

Well, Matt Damon's name in the movie is Bill Baker.

No one is named Stillwater.

What?

It's like Stillwater.

They made a movie called Stillwater.

Nobody's even playing Stillwater?

Right.

Yeah.

This is even worse.

That's like making a movie called Jay Edgar and it's about some dipshit from Ohio.

Well Stillwater, starring Matt Damon is this guy Baker, Mr.

Baker.

Don't promote it!

In theaters this Friday.

You don't even care.

I don't care.

You're not in it.

But now I'm invested.

Oh, I wanted to.

I'm a part of the...

Tom, Marthi, and screenplay by him.

Yup.

Wonderful director.

We're at East-State July 30th.

Just people know and they don't see it.

Run, don't walk away from Stillwater the movie.

But you're probably running towards a different movie theater.

What?

Probably?

Yeah.

Any movie theater, probably in any direction away from it.

So, here's another movie direction.

In your mind, every similar business is right next to each other.

And right next to it.

And if you're running from a movie theater, you're running towards another movie.

Yes.

Why would they be...

They're not next to each other.

I'm saying...

Like when you run from your problems, you're just heading...

I'm saying just like Casey says.

You go to a city, right?

Yeah.

Don't drag Florida into it.

You go to Burbank...

That is your name, right?

You go to the Burbank 16, right?

And you start running away...

You got what?

Who?

You got to check it out.

No wonderful movie theater.

The Burbank 16.

Okay, so what is a wrap-around movie theater?

A wrap-around?

Yeah.

So, if you're running away from it, you're also running towards it.

No, you're not running towards it.

You're running towards a different movie theater.

If you start running away from the Burbank 16, you're just running towards the Universal City Walk Theater.

How close are they?

I mean, are you saying in the direction?

Yes.

Like energetically, directionally.

Okay.

So, I'll grant you that if you are running away from a movie theater, odds are somewhere in the world you are running towards another movie theater.

That is what I'm trying to say.

Thank you for granting it to me.

I grant you that.

Okay.

Good.

Good stuff.

But still run away from it.

Because you know why?

Because maybe that other theater you're running to is not showing still on it, but he's showing...

Go versus spread.

I would imagine it's in limited release.

So maybe that'll help.

Go versus spread?

No, still water, unfortunately.

Good.

If they're limited to show in hell.

Oh my God.

Oh wow.

You're fair.

He's more than concerned.

Number one, five.

Ah, yes.

Number 15.

People, by the way, they wonder if we're actively listening to the clips.

Yes.

Of course we are.

We spend 10 hours here.

We're sitting here just as long as you are sitting there.

And that will be true for the rest of your lives.

Yeah.

Whenever you sit, we'll be sitting.

When you sit, I sit, we sit.

All right.

So obviously the reason...

There was a big call to action if we need to get JW's so water in here.

Because the posters for these movies were up in LA.

We were like, we gotta do this.

People sent it to me so many times.

Yes.

Yeah.

Our friend, Chip Zadarski, who's a comic book writer and artist.

I think I see he's just a comic book.

He's a comic book.

You've heard of Spider-Man?

Yes.

Chip Zadarski.

He has a comic name still water.

That's right.

And so there's a lot of still waters out there that are running deep.

Yeah.

So, oh yeah.

So anyway, did you have fun doing that episode?

I did.

What was the first episode?

We didn't listen to Katie Rich who comes on after that clip that you just heard, but she was really funny on it.

She was hilarious.

She's been really good on the show this year and been enjoying her as a recent addition to our stable of improvisers.

And yeah, that was fun.

I mean, July...

The Dog Days of Summer, we can certainly agree on that.

A song by the Decemberists, times two, times three.

What was going on in July?

The Birth of our Nation, of course.

Sure, but this is a good 22 days, three weeks and one day after that.

Yeah, but I like to...

July, for me, it's a month-long celebration of America.

Good.

All right.

Great.

Well, that was fun.

I like to listen to that.

I did too.

I'm glad we listened to the clip as we always do.

As we always do.

All right, we need to take a break.

We are so deep into the show for our first break.

I apologize for that.

But although people are probably happy about it.

But let's take a break.

It's free.

Let's take a break.

We're counting down, by the way, on this episode, we're counting down 15, 14, 13, 12.

So we still have three more clips.

But your mother on the shelf, I will go to the apartment.

You will stay and be a heart man.

Good.

How many falls did you take down the stairs?

When we come back, we're going to be listening to what you've chosen as your episode 14.

And you're going to enjoy it.

So you, it was a look.

Just come on, baby.

It was your idea.

You wanted us to do this.

All right.

We'll be right back with more comedy, baby.

After this, comedy, baby.

Best of 2021.

That is my cadence.

I'm here with Paul.

Something like this.

And that is my cadence.

Oh, you're not wrong.

And boy, we've been talking so much.

We got to get to a clip.

We got a, we're going to just jam right into a clip.

Holy shit.

We're going to get to right into a C.

Yeah, here we go.

Let's go.

Let's do it.

This is your episode 14.

Number one, four.

All right, Paul.

Here we go.

Episode 14.

I'm going to get it this time.

This is episode 701.

So right in the 700s.

Pretty early on.

Pretty early.

The 700s.

Yeah.

Under 710.

Okay.

And what?

The date?

Yeah.

April 12th, 2021.

April.

So we have had April Fool's Day.

Everyone has not met at each other anymore.

Took about 11 days for them to calm down.

Yeah.

People have dried off.

From April 10th.

Yeah.

The wet day.

Yeah.

Wet day.

We should celebrate wet day.

Remember, every April 10th is wet day.

Remind us of this in March of, yeah, maybe February.

I need a heads up for wet day.

So remember in February, it's a wet day in April.

And remember in the summer in July, remind us about recording the countdown.

Also remind us on April 10th that it's wet day and maybe we'll post something about it.

Well, wish us a happy wet day.

Please, thank you.

All right.

Do you want the title?

Just title.

Here we go.

Promo code sports.

Mm.

This is a good one.

Yeah.

You don't know what it was.

Okay.

This has a comedian and television host, Jamie Lee.

Sure.

The main guest.

I remember this episode is very funny.

We also have the improvisers on it are Carl Tarte.

Sure.

Ego Wodum.

Sure.

John Gabris.

Sure.

And Ben Rogers.

I mean, there you go.

A stacked cast on the house.

This was a really fun episode.

This one was over zoom.

This was when the pandemic was still continuing, although raging.

I believe this is right about when I was on the other side of my second shot for vaccinations.

But we hadn't returned to the studio at this point because I feel like I got it a couple of weeks before everyone else I knew or something.

So we hadn't gone back to the studio.

This was still over zoom.

And Jamie came on to talk about her show, The Wedding Coach, which is on Netflix.

People can watch.

It's a fun show where she meets with people who are about to get married and she coaches them through what they should do with their wedding and she helps out.

And she always has a very funny comedian on who joins her and helps out.

And then the comedian every time or no different comedians.

Interesting.

Different comedians.

If you can fathom that.

Oh, I can fathom it.

If your tiny, pea-sized brain can comprehend.

Me?

Yeah.

Oh, wow.

Aren't you a dinosaur?

Not anymore.

That's surgery.

It was a combination of surgery at a magic spell, right?

Yes.

Here's what happened.

I'm a dinosaur, but I could still think and speak like a person.

Sure.

And we all know that.

And there was a doctor who said, I can perform a surgery that will get you 90% of the way there.

The rest is going to have to be magic.

And the 10% was like, what, your leg or a tail?

My face.

Your face.

The worst part.

Yeah.

You are like a real butter face.

Yes.

I was a total butter face.

And so, yeah, I knew a witch and I got them together.

I connected them.

Oh, okay.

So she was there during the actual surgery.

Yes, absolutely.

Oh, no, no.

It had to happen kind of at the same time.

Simultaneously.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Well, you're back to normal and I'm sorry for cursing you, by the way.

Yes, I got it.

That's okay.

I understand why you did it.

You sucked.

I sucked.

I flat out sucked.

All right.

So we're going to hear this clip with Carl and Eggo.

Now Carl and Eggo are two great comedians and they've gone back a ways and they worked together a lot.

Yes.

And it's always fun when they're on the show together.

Oh.

Eggo, you may know from Saturday Night Live, she's a current cast member on SNL.

And so one of the good things about the pandemic this year was the fact that she was able to do shows from New York.

Yeah.

Because she so seldom here in LA anymore.

She used to be a regular on the show and then she had to move to New York.

And so now we only see her occasionally, but she did a lot of episodes this year, which was great.

So she and Carl are going to be on, we're going to be hearing this clip with them.

Carl is going to be playing a Tallyono Jones who's a lawyer that he's portrayed before.

And then Eggo is playing probably her most enduring character, Entre P. Newer.

So let's listen to that.

This is your episode 14.

Number one, four.

Please welcome back to the show, a Tallyono Jones.

Scott, what is it?

Scott.

Your email was so urgent.

Scott, are you okay?

Have you been injured?

How much money will you pay me to fix it?

I flew all the way here from Italy to be with you, Scott, in case you are hurt.

Are you injured?

Are you hurt?

Have you been injured in a motorcycle truck accident?

Have you been injured in a boat plane crash?

I will fight for you.

I don't think I've ever been on a boat plane, little and crashing one.

So no, I never been on a boat plane.

It was the exact type of plane that Theodore Roosevelt would ride when he would travel by sea.

Have you ever?

Have you been injured in one?

Scott, what is the problem?

Your email was so urgent.

I think I was just asking you if you wanted to be on the show.

But welcome to the show.

It's great to see you.

Oh my gosh, I would love to be on the show.

Where does it start?

Well, Tallyono Jones, you, by the way, Jamie, Tallyono is a...

He mainly seems to specialize in car accidents, motorcycle accidents.

A big part of your business is motorcycle accidents.

Yes, it is the biggest part.

Motorcycles are death traps.

I mean, the fact that you're exposed to the elements and you don't have protective shielding around you, that would...

Yes, let's say that you are riding a motorcycle and it starts to rain.

And so you pull over to the side of the road, but somebody drives by and shoots you in the stomach with a gun.

I will fight for you.

Okay.

So has that ever happened to you, Jamie?

No, but last year I fell on roller blades.

Would that count?

You were wearing them and you fell down or you fell on to roller blades?

No, I was wearing them and then I fell down.

So that won't work.

Oh, that won't work.

You're the roller blade company for not providing, like, correct stability?

Yeah, the other way.

The other way would work.

Let's say you would work.

Let's say you were walking down the street and you fell on to a pair of roller blades.

And the man that was trying to help you up was the same white man from the Nigerian wedding and he told you a dirty joke, I will fight for you.

And have you had any interesting cases recently?

I mean, you're out there in Italy and, you know, the country has been shut down a couple of times.

Recently, I had to sue somebody Scott.

No, who?

Yes, come on with yourself.

Me, myself and Irene.

Somebody was trying to somebody was trying to take my crown as the tallest man in Italy.

Oh, that's right.

That's a little detail.

I've forgotten about you.

How tall are you?

Six foot five.

That's which is not incredibly tall, but I guess in Italy that's the tallest man in Italy, me, Italiano Jones.

It's a family name.

Right.

Who's family?

Yours or someone else's?

The Italianos.

Oh, okay, right.

Scott, how have you been?

Have you been injured at all?

No, you've asked me that.

I've been injured at all.

I mean, my knee is still a little, a little fucked up.

It hurts a little bit, but that's my own fault.

It's not anyone else's.

How did you fuck up your knee?

Just life.

Your knee, life fucked your knee up.

I will fight for you.

Where are you going to fight, God?

Did you know that the Vatican isn't Italy?

Yeah, it's pretty famously in Italy.

It's in Vatican City.

I just found that out.

How long have you lived there?

My whole life.

You never took that one left turn that got you there, right?

To the, what do they call it there?

Where are the poplives?

The Vatican.

Oh, that's right.

The Vatican.

Okay, well, I want Jamie and Italiano.

I want you here for our next guest because our next guest is a little bit of a handful.

Okay.

I'm trouble navigating their issues on this show.

They are not a small business owner, but I guess an inventor is more of a way to describe them.

They've been on the show many, many times.

Please welcome back to the show, Entre P. Newer.

Hi, welcome to me.

Hi.

You're welcome.

You're welcome to me as well.

Welcome.

Jamie and Italiano, I don't know if you've ever met Entre P.

Newer, but Entre basically comes on and pitches new ideas for inventions, that's safe to say.

The majority of them, 99% of them are rectangular.

Is that...

Scott, Scott, now you're talking about me like I'm not right here.

Hi, Jamie.

Hi.

Hello, Italiano.

Hello.

Pleasures and greetings to everybody involved.

Okay.

So, Scott, I do have some ideas I'd like to get off my chest today.

And I would love to get these off my chest because I don't have time.

The dibble and dabble with you and on your comedies right now.

Sure.

No, I apologize for taking so...

In the future when you're on the show, would you like me...

I don't know if I'm coming back, Scott.

The way this has been going so far, I don't know that I'll be back.

Well, you can't fire me because I quit.

Okay.

Well, so is this my show now?

This is my show now.

That backfired on me.

Yeah, exactly.

I am the most.

You want to be the host?

I want...

I would like to be the host of Comedy Bang Bang.

All right, take on me, Italiano.

Italiano.

I think I have to do is say a catchphrase.

So when after the theme song goes off, oh no.

And then I have to say, strap me up to the top of a van and make it loud.

Is Comedy Bang Bang.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, you're doing great.

Thank you.

Go ahead.

So I think, no, unfortunately, Italiano, I would like to have a positive relationship with you and that was with all due respect bad.

That wasn't good.

That was not...

You know, when people say all due respect and then they say the rudest thing possible, mere seconds afterwards.

Well, I don't want to cut you off, Scott, but Italiano.

Italiano, I got a question for you before I get into my inventions.

Now, baby, are you any relation to my Italiano?

That means goodbye, by the way, Italiano.

It doesn't mean go ahead.

Am I relation to who?

Michael Tyson.

Michael Tyson?

Yes.

Are the famous of Tyson chicken farms?

Yes.

And then that is...

And famous for other things, probably.

That's pretty low on the list.

And boxing as well.

Any relation, baby?

Yes.

That is a long-lost American cousin.

Okay.

You sound American love.

Okay.

Ciao.

Ciao, do I sound American?

Okay.

Okay, baby.

All right.

I need to get to my inventions.

I do have an event to do.

Okay.

In the future, if you ever are on the show, would you like me to say your name and then immediately say...

In the future, I'd like for you to respect my domain.

I work in the invention business.

Did you...

By the way, have you acquired the domains necessary for all of your inventions?

Do you have EntrePeneuer.com?

EntrePeneuer.com is my website.

I also have .org and .gov.

Should anyone try to get it from up under me?

Yes.

Okay.

Great.

Okay.

Good.

So, Scott, first things first.

I'm tired of taking...

I'm tired of...

How do you say...

Shit.

Well, you're the one trying to say it.

You want to say it?

Just go ahead and go out with it, EntrePeneuer.

Okay.

Okay, Scott, please let me talk on my platform.

Please.

You said you're giving me a platform and you seem to keep taking away.

I give you a platform, but the platform has conditions.

One of those conditions is when you start a sentence, you know how to finish it.

Well, Scott, you'd have to give me the opportunity to finish it, love.

Well, I mean, all the zithering and going back and forth, how do I say...

I mean, you know, you can't make your second sentence one that you have no idea what you're about to say.

I don't want to cut you off, but...

You didn't.

I don't want to cut...

I don't want to...

Well, Scott, I don't want to tell you to shut the hell up, but...

You better not, Entre.

What do you want to do?

We're going to have a problem.

We're going to have a problem, EntrePeneuer.

Are we going to have a problem?

Well, that's...

I'm in the business of problem solving, baby.

That's perfect.

What's our problem?

Our problem is you are going to tell me to shut the hell up.

So what's the solution?

Scott, shut the hell up.

What are you going to do?

Oh, okay.

What are you going to do?

Nothing, right?

Okay.

Exactly.

This one's going to be huge.

I am absolutely tired of shitting and peeing just anywhere.

Okay.

By the way, you've already tried to invent the toilet on a previous episode.

Oh, damn it.

Oh, and you know what a toilet is?

Oh, damn it.

No, no, I'm just looking at my notes here.

I'm looking at my notes here, baby.

No, no, no, baby.

I'm looking at...

Here's another problem, Entre.

Now you're just repeating yourself.

It's bad enough every time you come on the show, you do the exact same thing every single time.

You're reading previous episodes?

No, no, Scott.

Scott, Scott, it is Black History Month.

Please don't come back.

It's not Black History Month anymore.

It's still Black History Month.

We are one past Black History Month.

It's still Black History Month.

What is it in February through April then?

It's Black History.

Until we get our taxes.

Thank you.

Thank you, Caliano.

Okay.

I'll tell you what damn.

Okay, well, damn.

Well, damn.

I have something else.

I got something else for you.

I just have something else for you.

Since you want to tell me I haven't...

Yeah, yeah.

Maybe we could reverse engineer this.

Jamie, have you ever had a problem that you wish there were a solution for?

You wish there was some sort of invention maybe?

No, Jamie, maybe keep it basic now for me, okay?

Yeah.

Entre is a basic bitch.

Scott, it is Black History Month.

It's not Women's History Month anymore.

I can say bitch.

It's Black History Month.

It's Italian Black Women's History Month.

No, I'm not Italian.

Maybe I'm not Italian.

I take that.

Go ahead.

Jamie, please, what's your problem?

Um, okay.

I'm tired of spending money on makeup because I feel like there's so many different products.

Perfect.

Got you covered.

Love.

Okay.

Tired of spending money.

Bitcoin.

Have you heard of Bitcoin?

You stopped listening after the money?

I'm part of it.

Tired of spending money.

Bitcoin.

Love.

It's amazing.

You don't have to hold it.

You don't have to physically hand it to nobody.

Jamie, are you into crypto?

Is it like Apple?

Okay.

Sure, sure.

Yeah.

What about NFTs?

Where do you land on NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens?

Doesn't the band Kings of Leon have an album?

Yeah.

That is a wonderful one.

That's an NFT.

Yeah.

I mean, anything can be an NFT.

They're turning tweets into them.

They're turning stage diving at one particular concert is an NFT now.

And anyone can be a BAB basic ass bitch.

Okay.

If we do an NFTs.

How are you taking my jokes?

Is that what we do in Scott?

Because this is my show now, baby.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

But you are an inventor and you just saying Bitcoin isn't an invention.

And Jamie actually, she kept going and she said she's tired of buying makeup and that's truly her issue.

Okay.

Well, if that's your issue, the invention isn't don't wear it.

That's what I want.

Don't wear makeup.

You don't have to wear it.

You don't.

You could just let me just let me do it.

No, let me just let me.

You just I'd like to just I'd actually like to just you just first and then I'll just us.

Here's the deal.

Everybody is born.

Everybody.

Stop being nasty at delion.

Okay.

He said just station and you as you said, everyone is born.

Everyone is born.

Okay.

Every human is born with a rectangle on their neck.

Right?

Am I wrong?

Yes.

Are you talking about the actual neck as a rectangle or are you talking about the Adams apple or?

Well, no, a rectangle on your neck, Scott.

How do you mean?

Stop trying to erase.

You're trying to erase women, by the way, talking about everyone's born with an Adams apple.

No, I'm merely trying to figure out what you're saying.

Are you talking about a birthmark or a rectangle on your neck?

What could it be?

What is on your neck?

I think I don't.

Jamie, can you take the red?

It's alliano.

All right.

In Italy, we call it Adams apple and the wrong.

That's Spanish.

That's an orange.

And over.

Listen.

Listen, listen, what are you talking about?

Why is this so hard?

See, I shouldn't be pitching to, I shouldn't be pitching to fools.

Okay.

I think you're just talking about the neck.

Is that right?

I have an interview with Oprah after this.

Oprah is interviewing you or you're interviewing Oprah.

I'm interviewing Oprah.

Okay.

Well, that won't.

Oh, wouldn't you like to know love?

Okay.

So everybody, everybody here has a neck.

Yes.

Sure.

Everybody has a neck.

We protect it.

We respect it.

Yes.

Okay.

Protect the neck.

Love.

Okay.

On top of your neck.

Mm hmm.

What are you talking about?

Heads.

If that's what you call it, awesome.

You can't invent heads.

Who says I can't?

You did.

It took you all about 10 minutes to figure out what I was talking about.

Now you want to tell me.

So you want to come up with an easier head for everyone to remember?

No, I don't know.

No, but I do want, I do want people to be okay with the rectangles that are on their necks.

So you don't need to buy makeup.

Makeup is a waste of money.

You see where I'm going, Scott, because as much as you try to downplay my intelligence, Scott, I am very intelligent.

I got into Harvard three times.

You're very intelligent.

Yes.

You're great.

I'm very intelligent and smart.

See, Italy, we call coffee intelligentsia.

I don't think so.

This was exhausting.

This whole, this whole.

It truly was exhausting.

Today was exhausting.

I'm exhausted.

You're exhausted.

You're bombatid.

You're rude.

I'm exhausted.

You're rude.

I'm perfectly pleasant.

You're not smart.

I'm in what?

I don't say this all my guests, but you have been a pill ever since you come on this show years ago.

Why?

Because, Scott, how do you think, how do you think I feel I'm sitting up here and I listen to you describe me as difficult to describe.

And you're calling me a small business owner.

Nothing is small about my business, first of all.

I'm making things that change people's lives.

You're not even an entrepreneur like your name.

You're an inventor.

You came on as an entrepreneur named Andre Pannuer and then you just segued into inventing things.

What makes an entrepreneur?

Scott, fuck right off.

Scott, we allowed a cuss on this show.

Number one, four.

They did it again.

They certainly did it that one time.

I mean, they is us and we did it as we listened to the clip.

Thank you.

Anytime we do something, you always are like, they did it again.

You know we're doing something for them.

They did it again.

They are listening.

Make a pact with yourself that any time you have lunch, silently to yourself is fine.

At least think it.

Just think I did it again.

Every single time you have lunch.

My preference is until you die.

But silently is fine.

Silently is fine.

I hope that does become a thing for somebody.

They listen to this and now they can't get it out of their mind.

Yes, that they will always every time they have lunch.

I did it again.

Well, that was really fun.

Agreed.

Those guys are really funny together.

We didn't listen to the clip of Gaboris and Ben.

By the way, Ben Rogers has done some great episodes this year.

He has a character called The Night Wolf, which is very funny.

I'm not sure if we've ever talked about the origins of The Night Wolf.

But the character's not named The Night Wolf, right?

The character is a photographer.

No, no.

The character is a photographer.

We've talked about The Night Wolf a lot.

I don't think we've ever talked about it, but I had assumed it was a bit that Ben had worked on.

He auditioned for the Between Two Ferns movie and did this as his audition.

Did The Night Wolf as his audition because basically the parameters, we didn't have any parameters for the movie other than just like you can mail, female, whatever it is, we don't care.

You just come in with a take on your character, essentially.

Everything was still secret.

It was like you work at a local news outlet.

And so he came in and did The Night Wolf.

I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd seen.

Which, if people don't know, is he is a guy who talks about this vigilante hero called The Night Wolf a lot.

That he's photographed.

He's essentially like Peter Parker with Spider-Man.

Yes.

Clearly he is The Night Wolf.

He is The Night Wolf.

It's really, really funny.

We did the movie and obviously Ben didn't make it into the movie, but I was thinking about that bit forever.

I would like reach out to him.

I'm like, is that a bit you've done on other things?

He goes, no, I just created it for the audition.

I'm like, it's really funny you should do it.

So anyway, he's done several episodes on The Night Wolf.

That's a consolation prize.

And by the way, this is one of Gabers' first characters that he's performed.

Other than Chino.

Oh, I was going to say, what?

Wait, I don't remember what did he do on this episode?

He did the sports guys.

He did the podcast hosts Jeff and Jeff of the sports dude podcast.

Oh, that's right.

That's right.

Yeah.

We didn't listen to the clip because we just don't have time to listen to the entire episode.

But go back and listen to them doing it.

It's very funny.

I guess I forgot because the voice was so different from Gino.

You were lost in it.

Yes.

You didn't even know who you were listening to.

You were listening to Jeff of the sports dude podcast.

By the way, a little bit of trivia.

Did I talk about this last year?

I don't remember.

But okay, so during the pandemic, the learning curve, we had a Steve Steve learning curve on how to keep this show going.

When we first went into quarantine, I had about six weeks in the bank.

You were trapped in a bank for six weeks?

Trapped in the vault because I'd been robbing it.

And you survived on lollipops?

Yes.

Well, that's what I was robbing.

You fool.

But I had about six weeks in the canon.

I was also trapped in a bathroom.

You were in jail?

Two weeks ago.

And I remember saying to people, I was like, six weeks is probably enough, right?

Like we'll be back in the studio after six weeks is over.

And the one person who I talked to, Jason Mandzuga's over Zoom, he's like, no.

This is going to be a year, a year and a half.

And I was like, okay.

And he was right.

But so it was a very steep learning curve on how the show was put together.

The team here at Earwolf did just incredible work figuring out how to keep the show going whilst over Zoom and still make it have the feeling of live improv.

But every once in a while, there would be a mishap and where audio wasn't recorded.

And this was one of those episodes where Jamie, Jamie Lee, great comedian, about 15 minutes, I think, into the show, her audio cut out.

And so all we had was really terrible, super far away Zoom audio off of her computer mic, which wasn't even by her.

And she, I got to give a special shout out to Jamie.

We contacted her when we found out and she went back and rerecorded every single thing she said.

That's wild.

And Devon over here talked her through it and gave her the cues.

Devon, I believe didn't you transcribe everything she said first?

And then we sent it to her and she got in the moment and she did it because she was really, really wanted the show, the episode to be really good and wanted there to be no like weirdness where suddenly she sounds far away.

And so shout out to Jamie Lee for doing that.

That was she went above and beyond for that.

I picked up on your little passive aggressive intimation.

Oh good.

Yes, I will try harder.

You were fine.

I've rerecorded so many episodes and I never gotten this shout out.

I did one, not my parts.

Oh, you recorded other people's parts.

I have the we've never used it.

Because you haven't needed it, but if you needed it, I had it.

I had to rerecord my own audio.

Did I tell you in the last best ofs or I just told you personally?

I don't remember.

But I think you just told me personally.

There is an episode out there.

I don't want to say which one where I had to rerecord everything I said for one act of it for one whole segment.

So for about 20 minutes, so I had to do the same thing for an episode.

Because you were doing and I applaud you for trying something, but you were doing like a Dracula voice.

Yeah.

And then it did not sound good.

Didn't sound like Dracula.

It sounded offensive.

It was like an offensive stereo.

Exactly.

And you also didn't like say that you were going to do that?

No, it was very it was very uncomfortable.

And nothing I was saying was Dracula specific either.

Like if I thrown in a I want to suck your blood or something like that, maybe people would have gotten it.

But maybe.

Yeah.

Anyway, so I had to rerecord.

But yeah, so thank you to Jamie Lee and thank you to everyone in that episode.

That's a great episode number 14.

All right, let's take a break.

Okay.

Fine.

All right.

We did it.

We finally did it.

We did it again.

We had lunch.

All right, we'll be right back.

Comedy bang bang bang.

We're back.

Oh, feels good.

I feel good.

Do do do do do do do do do do.

Like I also knew that I would.

You know, they still haven't buried him.

Isn't that weird?

It's so strange.

He just feels too good.

He's still on a slab.

James Brown.

Yeah.

Do you remember that he didn't get buried for a long time because there was some dispute about his will.

So there's like, you know, what what?

Okay.

So there's a dispute about the will.

Oh, meaning how he wanted to be buried.

I think maybe that was part of it.

I can't remember why they couldn't bury him, but he was like on a table, essentially.

What was it?

Wasn't Casey Casey some being like traveled around the country?

For like a week after he did.

Well, people wanted to see his body.

Of course.

Remember the big FDR?

Casey Casey.

Absolutely put him on a train.

Train to have a train.

I did.

Coming up my death.

Oops.

Here it is.

I did it again.

He's he's one of the only people we got that from Casey Casey.

Yes, of course.

Legendary broadcaster, he would say that after every time he had anything, any meal, any meal, any even a snack.

Anytime he had gum, he would say.

Yeah, water.

Anything.

Weird guy.

We all agree.

It's a weird guy.

I know we're an oddball.

He would do that special every wet day.

Yep.

His wet taste special.

It's like Casey Casey.

Casey Casey's wet taste special.

Part of the part of the interesting thing of listening to these best of episodes is hearing us slowly go more and more insane as they continue.

It's too soon now.

This is bad.

We got ways to go.

All right, let's get to our next clip.

This is your episode 13.

Number one.

Three.

Ooh, unlucky.

All right.

Episode 13 scary the unlucky episode.

Yeah, this is this episode is cursed.

If you voted for this, yeah, cursed.

Anyone who voted for this, it's like a ring situation in your computer.

Yeah, you would think it's the people that didn't vote for it because they're the ones that are sort of responsible for it being number 13.

That's true because if they had just voted for it, it would have been 12.

Exactly.

So they're cursed too.

They're cursed too.

Anyone in the world is cursed.

Anyone associated with this episode is cursed.

Well, you're not going to like hearing that because I'll.

Oh shit.

I'll tell you who's in it.

Okay, this is episode 719.

It's in the seven 19.

From August 16th, 2021.

In the middle of August, we're in the six teens.

August summer hot, sweaty.

Temperatures of sometimes 100 even.

People are angry.

Baving suits though.

Dogs sweating through their tongues.

Yeah.

And sailboat.

A seagull.

The Iceman makes deliveries.

He comets.

I'm a fat one.

I'm a skinny one there trying to get the ice up a long set of stairs.

They're moving a piano as well.

Mr. Anderson.

Oh, okay.

This is an episode called Give It To Gilly.

Oh sure.

Give it to Gilly.

Now Paul, you are not involved in this one.

No, well, in my heart I was.

You were and in fact, you wanted to be there but couldn't at the last second.

What was it?

I can't remember.

That's a good question and I also can't remember.

I can't remember but I remember saying to Gilly and that you were going to be on the episode and then she arrived and you were not here and I had to explain it.

That's all I remember.

That's awkward.

I think I got some work.

Yeah, you got work at the last second.

Yeah.

This is, let me say who is on it.

This is our old friend Gilly and Jacobs.

Our old friend.

Our oldest friend.

Our oldest friend in terms of her age.

She's 71 years old.

Yeah.

She looks great.

Not really.

You know that for 71?

Oh, I thought you meant she looks great.

Oh, for 71?

Yeah.

No, she looks great.

I don't know what's happening.

I don't know.

No, of course we love Gilly and Jacobs.

We also have Will Hines.

We also have Dan Lipperts.

Shouldn't he have called himself Willian Hines for this?

Yeah, Willy.

Yeah.

Willian Hines and then Danian.

And Dan Yillian.

Dan Yillian.

Boy, I'd love a Dan Yillian dollars.

Oh, if I had a Dan Yillian dollars.

I wish I had a Dan Yillian dollars.

I'm not talking.

Oh, don't you're watching that this week?

This is a great episode, Gilly and...

Okay, I'm just going to say it.

This is one of those episodes where I had nothing.

I had no guests.

What?

I was behind the eight ball and I was like, you know, usually we get a lot of publicists and people like sending us guests that they want to have on the show.

And we're pretty selective about it.

But this is one of those weeks where it was just like, we need an episode.

I got nothing.

I wrote to Gilly and I was like, Gilly, I know you just did the show a few months ago.

But you have a Netflix movie.

We can promote that.

I don't know.

And she was like, yeah, I was just thinking I should do it.

I was just thinking I should do it.

Yeah, it was great.

And so she agreed to do it and then Will and Dan came.

And this turned out to be...

They agreed to do it.

Well, they came at least.

Well, but I mean, you can't take away their agency.

They also agreed to do it.

They did agree.

I didn't do it against their will.

Speaking of Will, Will Hines.

Against his will.

That's a good title for what is like his stand up hour.

He's been working on a stand up.

Yeah.

Against his will.

So he's got to write the material to that.

That would be a great hook for the special.

He doesn't want to do one.

Right.

He forces you at gunpoint.

Right.

Oh.

Are we in the special with the gun?

Yeah.

We share a gun.

We share a gun and we keep hanging it back before we...

We take turns.

No, you take.

This is getting heavy.

This is a really good episode.

Gillian's here talking about, of course, she has her podcast periodic talks.

Of course she has it.

That she does with Diona Reasonover.

And she has the Fear Street movie trilogy, which was on Netflix.

And then we're going to hear two clips.

We're going to hear first we're going to hear Will Hines portraying Will.

Comes in.

We'll talk about his process a little later, but he's a cartographer.

That's all I want to say.

And then we also have Dan is going to be playing Bill Walton, the NBA legend.

All right.

So let's hear it.

This is your episode 13.

Number one.

Free.

Welcome to the show Henry Sames.

So great to meet you.

Oh, yeah.

But I'm thrilled to be here.

Listen, I'm going to be real honest with you both.

If that's all right, I'm here.

No, I expect full candor from all of our guests.

Oh, please.

I'm not a good liar.

I have to be straight up.

I'm looking for business.

Oh, OK.

I'm a cartographer.

I make maps and as you might guess in recent decades, map making not as in demand as it was.

We've been everywhere, you know, we've been everywhere.

Everything's covered.

Yeah, most maps are for places once you mapped it once.

You don't need to do it again.

You really should have thought to be in a business where it has repeat business.

You know what I mean?

I didn't think that.

Hotcast Gillian and I.

Oh, it's perfect because we put out one a week.

One a week.

Doesn't tire us out at all.

No, it's energizing.

It is energizing to be here.

I've never heard of a podcast host getting tired or anybody getting tired of it.

So you guys were smart, but for you making a map, are you energetic the minute you you set down your pen and you're like, Matt, I love it.

I love it.

You say something like that map done.

Mm hmm.

Everyone has a closing phrase in the world of cryptography.

I don't.

I wish I had map done.

Mine is map.

Fonito.

Someone else had map done.

Another carton.

Yeah, map done was who gosh, who knows?

Matt, Magellan had that.

Matt done.

Yeah, of course.

Yeah.

Yeah, a man named Matt Dunne would have loved to have had it and probably doesn't.

It's a competitive world.

You got to say map finito.

Map finito.

And is anyone around to hear this or?

Never.

I'm alone in my room.

It's a lonely.

Well, it's your room.

Who else do you want in there?

Nobody.

You know what I mean?

You're playing lab out in an animal companion.

Okay, but what's the point of getting a room?

I do have an animal companion.

Thank you for asking.

Oh, what do you have?

Kitty cat.

Aw, cute.

I consider her a little familiar.

Oh, yes.

Like a witch is familiar.

Like a witch like an extension of a breed.

Fearstreaks.

1666.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Have you ever heard those words before?

Fearstreaks.

1666.

I haven't.

That'd be a great map.

You've never heard of any of those words.

No.

Fear?

Never.

You've never heard of fear.

Never.

What is that?

That's fear.

This.

Ah, I'm alone so much.

I've never startled.

My life is...

Not even your kitty cat jumping on you.

I know she's a sweetheart.

She's never a little sweetheart.

Yes, she never would.

She's my familiar.

She cares for me.

Henry, do you know that I actually in real life named my cat after a witch is familiar from the Scottish play?

I respect...

Oh, thank you very much.

Oh boy.

Don't want to say that around here.

Yeah, that's a superstition we have in the map making world too.

You're not allowed to say that particular play.

I'm talking about my baby.

No, don't!

It's gone!

I flew it!

I've been three times and spit over my shoulder.

Oh my god.

I've got a feeling again.

Twice in one day.

Have you heard of the melon Colle Dain?

Yes.

You're talking about... coming up with the date.

Yeah, when his brother stole all that money from him.

I can't believe I don't know any Danish people.

Map Beth.

Map Beth, yes.

Yes.

Not bad.

I'm going to write it down.

Is that your cat's name?

Yes, my kitty cat's name is Lulu.

Lulu.

After the British singer.

Two sir with love.

That's right.

She's my favorite.

Where do you live by the way?

What's your address?

Yeah, let's get more information on you.

Well, that's very personal to find out a map maker's address.

Well, I just... it ties into an earlier question.

So I'm wondering if you have an address.

If you could just say it.

We can bleep it if you want, but I just want to hear it.

You just want to know what my address is.

I just want to know what your address is.

I'm on 1000 Mill Plain Road.

Okay.

Danbury, Connecticut.

All right.

I'm going to talk about that word street.

Okay.

Good.

That's right.

Yeah.

Just want to see if I can catch you.

What if I was locked into one there?

Laid the trap.

Nope.

I've never heard of street.

Never heard of fear.

Never heard of 1666.

Okay.

Interesting.

What else?

I have a question for you.

We're still finding out a lot about space, which I know about because I've actually interviewed an astronaut for my podcast, Periodic Talks.

Wow.

What a brag.

Yeah.

Thank you.

I'm not sure what her knowing a lot about space.

Just having an astronaut on her podcast.

I guess.

No, I've had one astronaut on here.

Who's that?

I can't remember what his name was.

It was about a year and a half ago.

That's going to be a bummer for that person.

You're an astronaut and it's not enough to make people remember you.

Why don't you map space?

Yes.

Jeff Bezos went up there in a dang penis the other day.

No, we're all flying around in a flying dong.

I know.

He's like, let's throw out our trash up here.

You would be the first person to map it.

To map space.

I would love to.

There's no money in it.

Who wants to buy a map of space?

I'm broke.

I got to sell these maps.

Which maps do you have?

You have maps that people could buy right now.

What I've resorted to since most things are maps is I make personalized individualized maps.

So it is an area that technically they could find out an existing map, but I try to personalize it.

I like this.

Try to mark things.

If I were to make a map for you, I could theoretically map your route to work.

Sure.

And maybe mark things that are the first to you.

Like, oh, I like this restaurant.

Yeah, a restaurant you like.

This is the place where someone spit on me.

That would be a weird one to include, but it would be personal and individualized.

And then I could sell that to you.

And you might free that.

I like this.

This is a good business.

And it uses my map making skills, but it still has a hands-on.

Where would you get mapped if you could get a personalized map?

I like to do what if you did someone's whole life?

Yes.

Every step they've taken.

It could be.

We could start where you were born, for example, and into a place where you live currently.

We could mark things along there.

I bet there are babies who were born during iPhones with GPS that they know every single place that the baby has ever gone.

I can't wait.

I wish I could remember that.

For that generation, the individualized maps are going to be so accurate.

I can't wait for you guys.

Question.

I got a guess a little bit.

Is it important?

Is it important that a map is accurate?

Yes, that's a good point.

Interesting question.

I'm going to say yes.

Well, I've seen some exaggerated maps of the United States.

Sure.

Like a New Yorker's view of the world.

Yeah.

You know, it gets big and the rest of the country is small.

I love that cover of a marker.

Enraged me.

Those are inaccurate maps.

And their popularity baffles me.

Why anybody would like an inaccurate or purposefully distorted map?

I do not understand.

You liked them.

Sorry, you get so angry.

That's quite all right.

We are still like here.

You still like the passion.

We had the fear, yeah, on our end.

Yes.

I'm still in really 1666 now.

Are you accurate in the sense of your to scale, but everything is exact, exact, exact.

Do you do all the measurements yourself and everything?

Yes, yes.

It's got to be to the scale of the, whatever the map is.

What's the scale of a map usually?

My personally favorite, one to ten.

One to ten.

So only...

Only ten times as small.

These are big maps.

Hey, that's how I like it.

Most of my maps belong.

These are just maps to the neighbor.

These are giant maps.

They look great.

One to ten is really a...

Or they're small maps of a very small area.

Yeah, if it's like a molecule or something.

Ooh, yeah.

Or what about you can make placemats like little kids like to have placemats or maybe parents like educational placemats or their kids.

Yeah, exactly.

Gillian's pointing at me like I'm going to cosine.

So okay, yes.

Sure.

You know.

There's a placemats so the kid can be learning something while they're eating or whatever.

Like a map of their neighborhood maybe where they'll have to go or they're not allowed to go.

Do you like to learn things while you're eating?

Yeah.

Didn't you ever read cereal boxes growing up?

Cereal boxes.

Didn't they use fun facts on cereal boxes?

Maybe a little game.

Occasionally I would look at the Wheaties box and figure out who won the Olympics that year.

Guess I've always been more of an intellectual.

I suppose.

Maybe you are.

We weren't allowed to read the cereal boxes in my house growing up.

No.

I had a very religious family.

What does religion have to do with cereal boxes?

They just controlled my parents, controlled the information we were experiencing.

Anything that wasn't religious you weren't able to.

They didn't want to risk it.

They didn't know what was in the back of these things.

They didn't know what sort of information.

Yes, a woman in the corner.

Question, how do they then feel about you referring to your cat as a familiar?

It's caused a huge separation.

You drift with your family.

I had to basically agree to disagree and I'm not going to contact.

Are you interested in witchcraft?

Very much.

Yeah.

The dark arts.

Most of their dark arts when you practice them.

I only like the dark arts.

Oh.

Not the light ones.

Not the good ones.

Okay.

So maybe there's an area here where you could make a map of something related to your interest in witchcraft.

Done it already.

Oh.

Who would you sell it to himself?

Yes, the trouble, the trouble Gillian, and first of all, thank you for the suggestions.

I don't mean to be critical of them.

I'm not making podcasts for me to listen to.

I can't sell my dark arts.

I thought you were supposed to be your own first best audience.

Hard audience.

If you don't like it, who's gone off?

What I have tried to do is to map the evil in people's souls.

I like this.

Oh.

Okay.

I cast a spell of the dark arts with my familiar Lulu.

Lulu.

Perpetual kit.

Lulu, here, could we do the spell?

Could we practice it on Gillian over here?

I do happen to have Lulu here in my section.

A real Sioux Storm.

Yeah, that's right.

Yeah.

You should be Sioux Storm, by the way.

All right, I am.

I thought you read a Native American tsunami.

You mean the character from Fantastic Four?

Yes, I met the invisible woman.

How long have you been sitting on that?

Since we were talking about it early?

Well, not it for a little while.

Okay, good.

Good to know.

So you have...

Oh, here's Lulu.

Yes, I have Lulu right here in my section.

Lulu.

Now, Lulu was a kitten, but I have cast a spell to keep her in the kitten-like state forever.

That was Gilly, by the way.

The cat has been making noises, but then Gilly just went right on.

Yeah, and he's a little like...

Yeah, Scott would never make a cat noise beneath him.

Yes.

Scott's too cool.

Gillian, not at all.

That's my brand.

Yeah, this is Lulu.

She's a perpetual kitten.

She's frozen in this age by unnatural means.

And I don't know what any of that means.

I'm like, Fierce 12, 1666.

Yo, I have no idea.

You don't know what it means.

No, I've heard the words before, but I don't know what they mean to you.

I've frozen this kitten in her current age for the last 20 years.

What?

She is in the state of being six months old for the last 20 years.

Oh, you haven't literally frozen her in your icebox.

No, I didn't like...

You didn't steal her.

Oh, okay.

Two competing.

Ted Williams.

Disney properties though.

Oh, yeah.

So we're on the same way.

Same continuity of freezing characters.

No, no, I have used the dark arts to keep her at the same age.

Oh, okay.

Boy, I would love to do that.

What age would you be if you could stay at any age?

Oh, God.

Under 30, please.

Under 30?

You know.

I don't know.

Because sometimes you look back at old pictures of yourself and you're like, I'm like, I'm like, oh, I look way too young.

Boy, I was just a baby or whatever.

But if no one ever knows you get older, then people love it.

Love you at that age.

I don't know what I'm trying to say.

You feel like you have an answer to this question.

Which age would you like to have been frozen ass?

When was I the best?

I had 27.

27?

Yeah, that's when I was at my pick.

That's an athlete.

Two years ago.

Two.

Two years ago.

I knew you at your peak, I can say.

Probably.

Just certainly did.

Julian, what year would you pick?

Four.

Four interesting.

Four years ago.

You would stay four years old.

Your life is a very interesting choice.

You have the ability to speak.

You can probably read.

I was reading in three.

I don't know when you were reading.

I was in Montessori School, which I really enjoyed.

Your brain still continues.

So you would be able to do anything.

You'd be having adult conversations.

Your body would stay at four.

But you would be that creepy kid who talks like an adult.

I was that kid.

You're telling me.

You're still that kid.

Hello.

Now, using this kitten.

Have we gotten too off track?

It's never happened to me before.

Okay.

He's always on the map.

I never get off track.

I will now map the evil in both of your souls.

Both of our...

I'm so excited about this.

So this could reveal sides of yourself that you might not be ready to learn.

I'm going to be an open book.

Anything in my life is...

I'm perfectly fine with Gillian and the listeners seeing.

Okay.

I admire it.

I don't know if you feel that way, Gillian, but...

I do as well.

This will not reveal secrets or gossip.

This will just be your...

No gossip.

I'm afraid not.

No, dish.

Exo, exo.

But it will...

It should be her.

I fucking give it to Chris and Bell again.

She did it already.

It's her gig.

That's her gig.

Give it to Gillie.

Great hash ad.

We need to start to give it to Gillie campaign.

All right.

We've got to focus.

Come on.

Which one do you want me to have?

I want you to have Sue Storm.

All right.

Definitely.

Okay.

We need a series from Fear Street.

Great.

Give it to Gillie.

We need a love reboot.

Okay.

Someone replacing Paul.

A Scott Ochreman.

Maybe a Scott Ochreman type.

Okay.

But who better, really, when you think about it?

Give it to Gillie.

I like this one.

Okay.

Hash ad.

Give it to Gillie.

All right.

Go ahead.

Henry.

Here we go.

I'm now going to Lulu come here please and I'm going to lay out this parchment here.

Sorry.

I have some parchment.

I'm going to get some paper.

I'm going to give you a date because this is going to maybe throw you off, throw off your calibrations.

Oh, well, you're welcome to try November 1st of 2021.

Ah, fuck.

A mere month and a half ago.

I can't remember what happened.

Pretty early in the November's.

Can't remember what happened that recently.

My memory is very clear up to October.

Yeah, you have a very strong long-term memory and short-term memory up to October.

Exactly.

I will remember October and November and December by March.

You have delayed short-term memory.

I've told everyone should know.

It's a tragedy.

It's a lot like, you see that documentary?

Very good documentary.

I haven't seen it.

Oh, it's really good.

What is it again?

How do you mend a broken heart?

The BG's documentary.

Oh, I have seen the BG's documentary.

Stop pointing it.

I've thought about it.

I have seen the BG's documentary.

I thought there was a documentary called tragedy.

Oh.

I had not seen.

About what would it be about?

A tragedy, a presume.

And it would have that song.

Tragedy.

It would be about my ice cream coat falling off the ground.

Oh, no.

Tragedy.

Did that happen?

Did that really happen?

Was that one of your tragedy?

It's hilarious.

Comedy.

They should have done a follow-up song.

Yeah, right.

One mask is singing, one's on, one mask is singing the other song.

All right.

This is an episode called Nut Shell Yourself.

Nut Shell Yourself.

Sounds familiar, but I can't place it.

Can't place it.

It is the participants involved are Jason Mensuchus and Andy Daly.

Oh, sure.

Now we're talking about Crazy Town.

Yes.

This is where it gets bonoodles.

It truly does.

This is a Zoom episode.

Jason has not returned to the studio.

This is a Zoom episode, but we have been doing episodes back in the studio, but not everyone is completely comfortable with that.

Occasionally we'll do episodes outside.

We'll do episodes over Zoom.

This was an episode over Zoom with Jason and Andy.

And what can we say about this episode?

First of all, I should tell you whom Andy is playing.

Please.

Andy is playing Byron Deniston.

And he is following up on some threads from a previous episode which might be coming up on our countdown.

So Byron Deniston is a royal watcher.

He's a royal watcher.

And it's basically Andy came up with a character who's a royal watcher who essentially that term means something in England of people who follow the comings and goings and adventures of the royals.

He took it very quite literally.

Quite literally.

Yes, they have great adventures, do they not?

He took that quite literally where he is a royal watcher who hides in their trees and spies on them.

So Byron's been on the show for several years at this point, if not a decade.

Oh gosh, I guess so.

And what else should you know about him?

He wants Sean on a...

Did he want Sean on a...

We go through this in the episode.

I believe Hot Dog wanted that.

Hot Dog wants...

Okay, so Hot Dog is another character that Andy does.

He's a big water skier and a fan of Sean Ona.

He's the first person to ever water ski upon meat.

And he wants to be in the water ski Hall of Fame, but more importantly, we'll leave than that.

He is a big Sean Ona fan and he wants Sean Ona inducted into the Hall of Fame.

And...

The rock and roll.

The rock and roll are skiing Hall of Fame.

Yes, of course.

And when that happens, he believes that the apocalypse will occur.

And so we decided to do this episode because the...

We had been talking in a previous episode about the rock and roll Hall of Fame coming up and the rock and roll Hall of Fame ceremony occurred and we felt like we needed to follow up on the threats.

Exactly.

So that's what you're going to hear.

You're going to hear Andy portraying at least Byron Deniston, if not more.

That's right.

So let's listen to it.

This is what you voted on to be episode 12.

Well, Byron, great to see you.

Of course, we're certainly not going to say the phrase the pays, which is, of course, what's up hot dog.

Do do do do do do.

Oh, no.

Oh, hot dog.

What's up, you guys?

It's me, hot dog.

Hey, hot dog.

You guys conjured me.

All right.

I've always had to be conjured.

Now you, I suspect, have had a pretty impactful 24 to 48 hours.

It's even been longer than that, man.

It's been crazy.

My life has been crazy lately.

Really?

When you were before we conjured you, where were you?

Well, I was at the Sean and I house as a matter of fact.

Oh, the compound.

Yeah.

And I was just taking a world of shit.

As a matter of fact, I was just a man.

They were just taking turns.

Jibalushi sized world of shit.

I was taking a jibalushi sized world of shit, man.

It was bad.

Those guys are real mad at me, man.

Real mad.

What happened?

Because the last time we saw you, essentially, if I could nutshell it, your goal is to get Shana Na, the band, the 50s, Airsats 50s tribute band, Shana Na, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

They've been eligible for now for decades at least.

It's been a long time.

And you know they invented the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Shana Na invented the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in a song that they wrote.

They wrote a song in 1977 called The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Oh, that's the first time anybody ever heard about a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The ultimate indignity, of course.

So you think that's what you think Jan Wener heard that song and was like, yeah, we're doing it.

Yes, of course.

And not only that, but they predicted the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in that song.

And therefore, it's a prophecy.

Right.

Oh, that's right.

You believe that all of their song lyrics are prophecies.

Oh, I know that they are.

And if that prophecy comes true, then they will all come true.

And there will be teenagers.

And we will find out who wrote the book of love.

And everybody will get a job.

Slaves, of course.

And the book of love is the fiery book that God has written of all of the course of human events.

Yeah.

I'm not saying it's going to be fun, but it's...

It's the Rapture, essentially, is what we're...

It's the Rapture, man.

It's the end times.

And all that has to happen to trigger it is for Jan and I to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is the prophecy dictates, man.

And so your plan was, if I recall, and please tell me if I'm getting any part of this incorrect was...

You know, I will.

You had the members of Shana and Ah, legally changed their name to Tina Turner.

Well, I don't want...

As a band.

Yeah, exactly.

The individual members kept their own names, but the name of the band changed from Shana to Tina Turner.

And you had found some sort of loophole where Tina Turner had not copyrighted her name?

Is that what it was?

Not as a band name.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

She...

That was a real loophole in there.

She's only protected as an individual.

Exactly.

Any band could call themselves Tina Turner.

She really fucked up.

And Tina Turner, conversely, could call herself any band.

If Tina Turner wanted to change her name to Rush, she could do it.

Rush Limbaugh?

She probably could do that.

Why not?

He's not using it anymore.

Well, so the first sign of trouble came when the...

Shana and I did their gig at the Wild Rose Casino in Emmitsburg, Iowa, and they were billed for the first time ever as Tina Turner.

Legally, you had to.

Yeah.

Well, because that was...

And it was a mistake that I made.

I had them legally change their name to Tina Turner as a band, not realizing that they had this gig right before the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Oh, boy.

And so...

Did people show up expecting to hear Proud Mary and what's love got to do with it?

The theater at the Wild Rose Casino in Emmitsburg, Iowa, holds 1,200 people and they had 20,000 people sure.

And they were furious that the people that took the stage was not Tina Turner.

You know, the Tina Turner they expected and it didn't help that I...

Because at some point they were like, get out there and do something.

I got on there and was like, this is Tina Turner.

You are seeing Tina Turner.

Check the paperwork, man.

That was the first thing.

Did that tip off the first Tina Turner?

Tina Turner Mark 1.

It made the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Tina Turner's camp kind of aware that something was going on and so they had this...

They had put on their radar.

Heightened level of vigilance and this part of the story is crazy but we had...

I don't know if you remember this cowboy.

He's a cowboy.

Oh, the author.

Oh, Dalton Wilkopf.

Dalton Wilkopf.

You're thinking of Dalton Wilkopf, the podcast host.

The podcast host.

He's a cowboy?

He is a cowboy, yeah.

Yeah, he's a cowboy.

He's a podcast host.

He had come to be in in cahoots with us.

I'm not sure how.

But he said he had come to be in cahoots with our plan.

You'd have to ask him how that came about.

But anyway, so he was a really important guy because he was the guy who was going to prevent Tina Turner from getting to the stage.

Oh.

How was...

Yeah, how was he going to do that?

I thought he wasn't on your side.

I know.

He wasn't but then he came to be.

Huh.

He came to be.

You might want to ask him about it.

I don't know if there's a way to summon Dalton Wilkopf.

I don't remember.

Is there?

You're going to have to help me with that one.

If you text him, he might just come by.

Oh, here's what I will say.

I feel like he's...

I know him to be in the area because he's, I think, signing books.

Probably.

And I was listening to a podcast recently.

It was an Andy Richter's backyard.

So at least I know he's in LA.

I texted Dalton and asked him to show up if he can.

So I don't know if he's going to.

But I definitely texted him.

He probably won't.

Yeah, I got it.

What about the one?

It's hard getting ahold of him.

It's the last minute.

Yeah, he's been busy typing his own podcast, Bonanas for Bonanza, the confusingly titled show.

I don't know.

That title makes sense to me.

Does that make sense to you, Byron?

I love the titles.

It's very hard.

It would be very hard to just hear it said and then try and find it.

No, I think it's great.

I think it's great.

I think almost anyone would try every vowel after the B.

Yeah, that's right.

Well, if the first one didn't work, you'd go there.

I have to say, by the way, I guess I also forgot to unlock this door.

I mean, we just conjured you, hot dog, and you just appeared.

So let me unlock the door over here and see if that's...

You should also...

You should unlock the gates as well.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Because I'm almost positive you locked them around.

That is podcast etiquette.

Always unlock the gates.

All right, so here we go.

Let me just come over here, unlock the door.

Hey, goddamn it.

I'm waiting out here behind your damn door.

How long?

What do you do in texting somebody and then keeping your door locked when they show up to respond to you?

You say, come on over here real fast.

We need your help understanding something and not so.

I'm sorry.

I got that locked door.

I apologize, Dalton.

I know in the old West they didn't even have door locks.

No, they didn't.

Doors would swing both ways.

It's saloon doors.

Everything was saloon doors.

That right.

The only door in the old West was the saloon door.

Everybody knows that.

That's what I'm used to.

I pushed on it and it didn't move.

I beg your pardon.

Dalton, thank you so much for coming.

By the way, Hot Dog is here and Byron Deniston over here.

Oh, yeah.

What's up, you guys?

Oh, good.

Hello, Dalton.

So tell me, Dalton, what happened the other night?

Because we're hearing this.

I don't know if you've ever seen the movie, Rashomon, but there's got to be a Western equivalent of it.

Yeah, there is.

Somebody will tell me.

Okay.

What happened the other night at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

First of all, Rock and Roll, I don't know if you're even interested in that style of music because it's maybe akin to country in Western.

Oh, no, I have no interest.

I've just took that and bastardized it.

Yeah, I have no interest whatsoever in rock and roll music.

I think it's just about it tried to murder country music, in my opinion, but it failed.

Country music lives on.

So what were you doing there?

Because you were trying to help Hot Dog?

We're trying to get what happened the other night.

I've had a hard time figuring it out myself.

So last time we was talking about this, or maybe the time before last, I had gone to murder Hot Dog.

Right.

No offense Hot Dog.

Done taking, man.

With the with the Hot Dog gun made by that guy in Germany.

Yeah, that's right.

And no, he made the bullet.

He made both.

It was a bun gun and a hot dog bullet.

Okay.

Got it.

Yes, Scott.

So come on.

I tried to shoot him the one time shooting him in the heart, but his, that was a decoy heart and his real heart was down in his thigh.

And so I had gone another time to shoot him in the thigh where the heart was.

And I did shoot him in the thigh, but somehow that wasn't in his heart.

And that part I still don't understand anyway.

So I shot him and I thought I'd killed him, right?

And then all of a sudden I remember you guys saying, don't look out behind you.

And then that was the end of that episode.

Do you remember that?

I remember like something happened where the tape cut off or yeah, it was, it was crazy.

But and then we never asked about it again, right?

That's true.

We never inquired.

Never followed up on it.

Which had you on the show since then with that's so crazy.

I know that is weird, but it was it.

It's fine because it was just some little old man there with a sweater tied around his shoulders and a little cap.

And he was, he said, I'm going to hypnotize you, but that, but I felt that he had failed to hypnotize me.

But then next thing I know, I come out of a trance and I have killed 38 people backstage at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse in Cleveland, Ohio.

Oh my gosh.

Wow.

Yeah.

And it was a, I was being restrained and I barely escaped with my life and my freedoms from there.

So this, this little old man, he's wearing a cap.

What are you saying, a sweater over his shoulders?

Was he, did he give you a business card at all or?

Did he have an accent of any kind?

He seemed to be a city slicker.

I was a city slicker for sure.

Right.

Was he, did he, was he, did he ever mention the words, theatrical or producer?

Director.

I don't know about that, but when I asked him, who the hell are you?

He told me his name and then he followed it with the words theatrical director.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

But I don't remember.

We've talked to this guy.

It's Dom, Dom Herrera.

No, Dom, who's in those Fast and Furious movies?

Don de Lillo.

The author.

Don de Lillo.

Don de Lillo does machines.

Oh, that sounds right.

Yeah.

That sounds like what he told me.

Something like that.

Yeah.

So, so you're saying, Dalton, that someone was successfully able to turn you into a Manchurian candidate style like, that's, that's almost like you're a monster.

I will watch it.

This is, this is not good for you.

Oh, no.

Well, I, I, I gone to get myself reprogrammed by an Indian shaman out there in the desert.

Oh, I'm fine now.

Good, good, good.

But for, I, but man, I was mad and I was confused because he said, all I know is he says he, I'm going to hypnotize you.

And I says, who the hell are you?

And he told me, Donna telefixes machines, uh, theatrical director or whatever it was.

And then, hey, I was like, I laughed at him and I went about the rest of my business.

And then all of a sudden I'll wake up backstage at the, at the Cleveland thing and I'm laying on my, how much time is missing because you even remember your last appearance on this show where you hypnotize it during that?

I guess I must have been and I know it.

I'm in a fog for, for months at this point.

It's been months of fog, but I'm out of it now because I done had some peyote and, uh, it's all that.

Oh, good.

Good.

I mean, people doesn't look so good on the old CV.

Well, that's not the most people I've killed at one time, but I mean, hang on, let me correct myself.

I've never killed a person.

I've only killed monsters.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Very important distinction.

So these 30 some odd people were backstage in Cleveland where I have to assume they were.

I don't have a specific memory of killing them, but I think there must have been a cabal of creatures from the black lagoon.

They travel in cabals.

I've noticed.

Yeah.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hadge, Frankenstein monsters and doctors, Jekylls and Mr.'s hides.

Yup, exactly.

And a lot of them was probably invisible.

So, and you know, you've got to assume that if there are Frankenstein's there, then their brides must be as well.

Oh, sure.

You got to take care of them brides too.

You don't think that plus one.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Don't think I'll leave the bride alone.

Every monster has a plus one, don't they?

Uh, well, they, a lot of monsters is trying to find their plus one.

So for instance, creature from the black lagoon, he's trying to drag a plus one down into the lagoon.

Make her a minus one up on that.

But he doesn't understand.

He thinks she can breed down there.

Adi it.

Oh man.

You know what, Dalton, what might be a great way to, for you to, and I know you're not out there hunting monsters.

They just, you're, they, you're just noticing that you're out in these streets going to be a bit.

But if you were to create a dating app for monsters, they would sign up to her.

And you could, yes, yes, it's a honey pie.

You could, you could lure them into a scenario where they could call it like the monster app.

Yeah.

Or something like that.

What do you mean?

It's like a, what is it?

The monster app.

It's a graveyard app.

You know, something like that.

I hate that song.

I'm looking.

I hate that song.

You hate that song?

That song makes me mad.

Yeah.

Matter of fact, I've written a response poem to it.

I don't know if you want to talk about that.

Wait, you've written a response poem to the monster?

Yes, I have, goddamn it.

Oh, wait.

So this is because I haven't heard of response poems before.

You never heard response poem?

Occasionally there'll be a response song like Danny A. A. L.

O.'s Papa Just Wants The Best For You that he sang to Madonna.

Oh my God.

But Jesus Christ.

But a response poem is something that I've never quite heard of.

Oh, it's a big thing in cowboy poetry.

You'll have an evening of cowboy poetry.

It'll be one person does a new poem and then the whole rest of the night is just responses to it that have been quickly written.

People rebutting stage.

All of that.

Hasterly written response poem.

Yeah.

So you've had a busy couple of nights and hot dog, how do you feel about the fact that Chana Nod didn't make it?

I mean, you know, it's another year where Chana Nod is not making the prophecies come true and bringing about the rapture.

I'm furious, man.

It's terrible.

And I feel like I don't know what to do now because I tried the Dubu brothers scheme and the Tina Turner scheme and I feel like I'm almost running out of ideas.

Can I just stop you for one second hot dog?

Yeah.

All right.

Because something has just occurred to me.

All right.

The band Chana Nod is now currently called Tina Turner.

Yes, it is.

So you could start the band Chana Nod.

Oh my God.

Wait a minute.

Why do you read all these other guys?

Currently, Chana Nod is an open band name.

Oh my God.

It's an open assignment.

But you know what I could do?

I could make Chana Nod full of people who the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is dying to induct.

Yes.

Well, you could just hire people they've already inducted so you could hire Paul McCartney for this.

Oh my God.

You could, you know, I can put together a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame supergroup and call them Chana Nod.

And the minute that you finally get the last person, they're already in the Rock of Hall of Fame and Chana Nod is already in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Yes.

Here's what's, here's what's hard about this.

And this is where it's going to come down to a really difficult personal decision.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

If you want, if you want to be in Chana Nod, you're the only person who won't have been in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will not be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

So if your personal dream comes true, the prophecy will not.

But if you are self-sacrificing, the prophecy will come true.

Guys, this is literally the hardest decision anybody has ever been presented with.

This is impossible.

I can assemble a group of Hall, Rock Hall, inductees and the prophecy will immediately come true and the heavens will open up and the end times will begin.

The hardest decision since Meryl Streep decided whether or not she's going to star in Sophie's choice.

I heard she deliberated over that for a long time.

In a very long hot shower.

Her agent said no and her manager said yes and her accountant said yes and her loyal said no.

Oh, man.

It was wild.

So wow.

I mean, but I think the band would be so great hot dog you would get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

That's probably what you want to go.

Wow.

So you're saying I put myself in the group along with who Paul McCartney.

Ringo.

Oh, man.

You know, Danny Moore of the Doobie Brothers that you want, whoever.

And I'm in the group too and we are so good.

But then we'd have to wait 25 years.

Yeah, that's true.

It might be worth it, man.

You know, I mean, like listen, it's up to you, man.

All right, guys.

Dalton, we end up with you.

Are you ready to, I guess, read this poem, response poem or sing this song?

I'm not quite sure what you're going to do.

I think I'll sing it.

And then you guys could come in on the course if you figured out what to or but if it's too confusing, don't bother.

Here we go.

This is a response poem called Monster Trash.

This is the title, Monster Trash, a response poem to Monster Mash, which can be sung to the tune of Monster Mash by Dalton Wilcox, meaning that this song poem is by Dalton Wilcox, not Monster Mash, which is by some other son of a bitch.

Leo Carpazzi.

Leo Carpazzi by Dalton Wilcox.

Here we go.

And so you have to imagine the bubbles in the door creaking.

Well, right, all right.

First of all, you started off your song by admitting that you made a monster.

That's wrong.

You're singing about it, but you ought to be ashamed.

Just think of all the cowboys that could end up getting maimed.

Your song is trash.

Your song is monster trash.

It's monster trash and it curls my mustache.

It's monster trash.

It's like a bad saddle rash.

It's monster trash.

Your song is monster trash.

Your second verse really made me fume.

You let vampires feast in your master bedroom.

They're feasting on cowboys.

You son of a bitch.

I'd like to shoot you in the liver and leave you in a ditch.

Your song is trash.

Your song is monster trash.

It's monster trash and it curls my mustache.

It's monster trash.

It's like a bad saddle rash.

It's monster trash.

Your song is monster trash.

Then you talk about Dracula and his son.

And that is when I more or less came all the way undone.

If the goddamn vampires are learning how to breed, then the cowboys of the west are fucked, guaranteed.

And a vampire only mate with one of his kind or are they coming for our women, which would make me lose my mind.

You don't address that matter.

I guess you didn't have the chance.

Cause all you want to talk about is how the monsters dance.

Your song is trash.

Your song is monster trash.

It's monster trash and it curls my mustache.

It's monster trash.

It's like a bad saddle rash.

It's monster trash.

So here comes a backlash.

Now everything's cool.

I'm not really that mad.

I'm up here and about the fun all them monsters have.

Hell stop on by the ranch.

I'll lay out a party spread.

We'll dance around and drink some punch and then you'll all be dead.

Your song is trash.

Your song is monster trash.

It's monster trash.

And here's my weapons cash.

It's monster trash.

How about a wooden steak gas?

It's monster trash.

Your song is monster trash.

And that's the end.

Oh wow.

Bravo.

Number one, two.

Oh boy.

Ah.

Buh.

Wait, I can do a Dracula.

What did he ever say?

When did he say, Buh.

Buh.

He never said that.

Although that is the Dracula.

I know.

Buh.

I don't think it should have been accepted.

Was that making fun of him?

Buh.

I've all done good blood.

It's weird.

You never said that either.

It's weird when an impression of someone is basically like someone making fun of you.

Like if you were to make fun of me and go do it.

And that became the accepted imitation of...

I never do that.

Hey, wait a minute.

My eyes are darting around for a separate reason.

Wait a minute.

You know you make me blood.

In the 80s, did you ever go to dances and that was played at every dance?

Every single time.

Because it was the time when everyone would get out there on the floor and do the whole stuff together.

Yeah.

And then they'd all crouch.

I wonder if people still do that.

I remember thinking it was fun.

Now when you think about it, it's fucking stupid.

Also bending over?

Not my favorite thing to do.

Bending over.

You know, crouching.

Yeah, we would crouch.

Crouching bending over.

Two different things dear.

Oh, I was bending.

I was just doing a full on yoga.

You're touching toes.

You're still higher than everybody else.

Why is he doing that?

You think my butt is higher than everyone else?

If everyone else is crouched on the ground, yes.

I do have a high butt.

You're right.

Yeah, I have a high butt.

Why are you playing like this?

You're being fake and phony.

I know, but I do have a high butt.

That's awesome.

Happy.

You got that in there?

So that was a fun episode.

And that was our most recent episode with those guys.

But we may, I don't want to spoil it, but we may be hearing some earlier episodes from them.

Intristado.

Later on in the countdown.

And speaking of later on in the countdown, we have three more episodes of this to go.

We have one this Thursday where we'll be counting down episodes 11, 10, 9, and 8.

We have one a week from today on Monday, December the 27th, where we are counting down episodes 7, 6, 5, and 4.

And then our final part four will be on December 30th, where we have the top three episodes of the year.

This is, we're not with the episodes don't fall on the holidays this year.

They do not.

It's fun when they fall on the holidays.

They do not this year, but they are so close.

I mean, they're just.

They're so close.

A hair's breadth away from these holidays.

Just an FCH.

And listen, we're going to close out the episode.

Let's not, let's, let's do it the next episode.

I don't, I want them to do, do you want to do it all four times?

I want to do it all four times.

All right.

This is the most exciting moment in podcasting.

This is of course.

The snowman game.

That's right.

The snowman game.

Now explain this, Paul.

What happened to this?

There's this, there's this battery operated snowman.

And you replace the batteries.

Do we know if the batteries are good?

Oh my God.

Oh.

And you press this little fat hand.

And what happens is he sings a song and he slowly, he rotates a few times during the song.

If he rotates, he, he, he not only dances about and, but he then rotates, goes, does he only go clockwise or does he go?

I don't remember.

No, he goes one direction.

He goes one direction.

And he, he, he, he, he, so he, he was your favorite one direction member.

Probably Harry Styles.

Why?

Because he's an eternal one.

I know.

Okay.

What about Zane?

Oh, I forgot about Zane.

Nowadays, everybody.

So, I forgot about Zane.

He, he will sing and then he'll rotate a little bit and then he'll stop right there, sing some more and then he'll rotate again.

Sometimes he'll do big rotations.

He'll do small ones.

Yes.

But when he, if he stops and is facing you.

At the end.

It is a thrilling, at the very end.

It's a thrilling feeling.

It's thrilling for the participants involved.

Even if he's not facing.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But it's even more thrilling for the listener.

I'm going to start him looking at Devin.

Okay.

And then we'll see where he goes.

All right.

We'll see where he goes.

Here we go.

There's a most, do we need to put a mic on him?

All right.

Here we go.

This is the snowman game part one.

He's dancing.

He's just moving on.

Oh, okay.

He's turning.

He's done a counterclockwise for three.

He's very close to Devin.

He's now looking very close to Devin.

Now he's doing one, two, three.

Oh, he's looking right at me, but he's not stopped.

This is it.

One, two, three turns.

He's looking right at Devin.

Devin, this is the final one.

This is the final one.

Here he goes.

One, two.

Oh, no.

He's off.

Very close.

He did look directly at Devin and directly at Scott.

But no.

I didn't win this time.

He ends.

He's looking at nothing.

Looking at nothing.

Why do anything?

With that, we leave you.

Goodbye.

All right.

We'll see you on Thursday for best of part two.

Thanks for listening.

Bye.
