♪♪♪ Pop the bubbly and play the booblay. The holiday season is upon us. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

That's right. The holiday season is upon us. Thank you so much to Jizzysnizzy. Oh boy.

That catchphrase submission. An audible groan from our guest who had the mic down by his belly button.

Did you think that your mouth was down there? I thought what if you can hear I was hungry?

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Yes, that's right. That's your personal welcome to our guest.

It's that. And now welcome to all of the listeners who make up the grand sum of the people listening to this show. The grand sum. I'm sorry. Welcome. The grandson of the people listening to this show.

Thank you for making up the grandson. One of my favorite stories. What have people fucked during this episode and then their kid fucked and then a grandson was born?

Like within the span of the episode? Sure. Well, no. That seems unreasonable.

I don't. Look, it may be a lot to expect but come on listeners. We'll never know if you don't try.

That's right. Please give us a grand son. We've been waiting. Oh, and I want a grandson.

I don't want to die before I have a grandson from this show.

I don't want to die during a grand son happening. I don't want to die. I'm going to go over there. I want to live.

Light up this guy. Do live. Do live. Oh, also Hanukkah.

Also Hanukkah. That's a holiday.

Also Hanukkah. By the way, and we'll introduce you in a second and myself, is Hanukkah still going on at this point? I admit that not ever having celebrated in 2017. No, I mean, today is, of course, Christmas day. Is Hanukkah still is the festival of lights. Yes. We in the midst of it.

It's eight crazy nights, right? It's eight crazy nights. So I believe it might be over by now, right? It might be. Engineer Cody Ryan, could you look up what day Hanukkah begins and ends 2017? That would be a bummer if Hanukkah were over by Christmas and everyone's celebrating Christmas. And then you're like, well, I don't get to celebrate anything today.

Isn't it nice though? Isn't it nice? That's not even a song.

It's not even a nice.

Oh, yes. It is. It's in the clouds. Are we a clown? Are you in a pair?

Isn't it rich, right? Yeah. But so what? Is it cool? I wonder if isn't a nice, isn't a lyric in it?

Also, engineer Cody Ryan, look up, isn't it nice and send him the clowns?

Isn't it nice lyrics? So do you have it? Yes. So here's what I'm saying. You have your Hanukkah celebration. Hanukkah. It's in the clear of Christmas. No overlap, so it's more special.

No overlap. No overlap. Then you still get one day off.

Is that one of the new Star Wars characters? No overlap.

Lord, no overlap. Lord, no overlap. Did you read that article?

The Popeye Road? Did you read that? I got that. I got that.

I got that. I got that. I got that.

I bet you know, the nutritional properties. That's all he ever writes about. Oh my god.

You have another subject. Popeye Ryan, what do you have?

Did you read the article about when's Hanukkah beginning and boy, so you've been living with those levels. Hanukkah this year is Tuesday, December 12th to Wednesday, December 20th. So it's over. It's over.

Hopio had a great Hanukkah. Hopio had Hanukkah. I hope the one good gift was really good, and I hope the seven practical gifts were useful. We're very useful. I'm assuming underwear.

That's what I would get every year. Socks. Underwear and socks. It's like, mom, dad, buy me the underwear and socks during the year.

You're saying you'd give that a year for Hanukkah? Yes, that's the one Hanukkah gift I would get.

You didn't know I didn't celebrate it.

Basically, I think they were trying to say change your underwear once in a while.

We used to get pajamas every year. Really? That's very nice.

My ex-girlfriend, Coolop, got me pajamas this year, matching pajamas between me, her and our dog, Georgia. What kind of pajamas? What do they look like?

I didn't look at them. I kind of went, oh, and gave her a little nod and then went about my business.

I just customary in our house. Have you been visited by those ghosts yet?

I hope to. I have been visited by those UFOs. We've seen them for the sky.

That's right. Three UFOs that teach you the true meaning of space.

We look at them and say, wait, how is it moving like that?

That's not like a normal jet fighter, the three o'clock. What I was going to ask is, did you read that article about the two characters in the recent Star Wars films named after Beastie Boys songs?

No, I did not. Apparently, JGL, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is in the new Star Wars film.

Apparently, everyone has a cameo in this. Remember when they used to just be populated with classy British actors or whatever? No, it's like every jerk who is friends with the director against being this. It's also robbing extras of the coolest thing they would ever do.

No, instead, Justin Thoreau gets to be in this. Oh, great.

It was him. I knew it.

Just JGL is playing the voice of the fish-like character who complains about the ship that landed, which sicks the police on... Oh boy, this spoiler territory, by the way.

These are not important plot points, but he plays a character in...

He plays a whiny fishman. He plays a whiny fishman.

And instead of having that be his name, whiny fishman, he is called Slow and Low.

Slow and Low, which is named after a Beastie Boys song, which the previous film apparently has a Beastie Boys named character of the same race. Are they races or are they...

When you'd say different alien, do you call it a race? I do.

Oh, I do.

Yo, is this racist? Anyway, I find that sneaking Beastie Boy illusions into Star Wars. You know what, Scott, I don't mind it. I think it's fun.

Do you know what I mean? Where do you draw the line? Like, you know, M&M references?

Yeah, that's exactly where I draw the line. That'd be exactly right.

I don't want any aliens. They stand.

In the new Star Wars, there was just an alien named Stan.

And another alien named The Moment.

Here's Han Solo. Here's Chewbacca. Hey, Stan, get over here.

He's a bokeh, he's a bokeh, he's a bokeh, he's a bokeh, he's a bokeh.

That's Stan. You should be in these Star Wars films.

Scott, that's what I'm saying.

You know what I mean?

I could have been in there for somewhat Edgar Wright's in there. He's not even an actual...

Daniel Craig. Daniel Craig is in there. And it doesn't mean anything because he's wearing a helmet.

That's right.

Just stick someone else in there. I can't believe it. That Bill Cosby in the latest film.

Bill Cosby is in the land. It's like, I haven't we...

In Hollywood turned our backs on him yet? He gets ready in Star Controversy.

He's playing a stormtrooper. He comes in and says, you see Captain Fails...

Fails... We got chocolate cake for breakfast for these prisoners coming up.

Four slices, shom, shom, shom, shom, shom.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

The very special, by the way, this is episode one, not like Star Wars episode one, the fans of Menace. That's right.

This is episode one of the best of 2017 episode one. We are doing four episodes comprising the best of 2017. Should we give these episodes subtitles?

I suppose we should, much like a fan to Menace? Yes.

Okay, now should they be Star Wars themed or should they just be subtitled just whatever we think?

I think just whatever we think.

Okay, so do we decide on these now or do we decide on them at the end?

I think we decide on them now because it could be aspirational.

We can live up to it.

Hey, Scott, you read my mind.

Okay, and should we do these together at the same time or should we come up with one word at a time?

Do you mean like a countdown three, two, one and then we blur it out?

Three notes one.

Three notes, three notes.

Forgive me. Don't you know what program you're on, my dear boy?

The callbacks to the early episodes are the best. By the way, we have not, and in this climate, we have not sung Jeremy Piven in a long time.

It's very true.

You know, it's very true.

That by the way, for recent listeners of the show, that came about in the early 100 episodes, I believe, when Paul in character, I believe, said does he sing Jeremy Piven?

Zach Delphinac.

Does he sing Jeremy Pivenac?

Sing Jeremy Piven, meaning does Jeremy Piven sing?

Yeah.

Because we had mentioned him singing something.

That's right.

And then you and I said, does he sing Jeremy Piven?

Yeah, and then we started to sing Jeremy Piven.

Yeah, and then we sang Jeremy Piven.

Jeremy Piven.

God.

Jeremy Piven to you.

Which now, though, can we sing Jeremy Piven anymore?

What's so funny is, of all the...

Of all the sexual abuse allegations that have come out, Jeremy Piven's was like just a blip.

They were like, yeah, yeah, we did it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay, lock him up.

Oh, I figured.

Yeah, I saw it.

I saw it.

I saw it on a garage.

Yeah, we did it.

Yeah, I just assumed.

When are all the other entourageers going down?

Exactly.

Who do you think...

Do you think turtle is innocent?

Turtle seems like a nice guy.

All of those guys.

Turtle seems like the nicer fellow.

Although, who knows?

I mean, turtle maybe seems like Justin actor who got put into this thing.

Who's Justin actor?

Justin actor?

Does he sing Justin actor?

What a great name.

Justin actor.

I'm Justin actor.

Hi, I'm auditioning for the new star wars.

I'm waiting for the role of Stan.

Risha Bockelhakha.

Oh my God, that was amazing.

We normally don't do this in the room, but you've got the part.

Can I?

Hmm.

Oh wait, you can't do it.

I was gonna request one more.

No, we don't.

Okay, but if you want to do one more, I would love it.

I mean, you're Justin actor.

Okay, let me do one more.

I'm Justin actor.

Actor, written for the part of the snap.

Greece Amaba.

Oh, oh no.

I've lost it.

Okay.

Do I still have the part?

And this is why we don't do it in the room.

Oh.

Ah, we really need to sleep on this.

Ah.

Personally, Justin, sorry.

Let me put on the mask.

Yeah, please go ahead.

Okay, that is just a George W. Bush mask.

That's right.

Is that?

I don't know why you were.

George W. Bush is canonically not part of the Star Wars universe.

He was in Game of Thrones.

That's true.

He got me there.

So can I?

Yeah, go ahead.

Okay.

Hit us.

Justin actor, written for the purpose.

Greece Amaba.

That's how far?

Oh, see.

Now it just sounds like George W.

Yeah, I know.

You're doing an actual impression.

I know.

How about a George H.W. Bush?

Can you do one of those?

Greece Amaba.

Are you going to do it?

Nah, God.

Oh, who knows?

Who knows the characters name was Naga.

Naga.

Perfect.

Why don't they do that?

Naga.

No.

I'm a princess.

Sold us an L sketch.

Yes.

Dana Carvey gets to be in it.

Naga.

Duh.

Lousy House, Pat.

Shop in Bracala.

Shop.

That's a perfect Star Wars name.

Uh, Dana, you know, he's back with Secret Life of Pets.

He could be in a Star Wars film.

I would love it.

I would like, and if he had Wayne's World hair.

I like that him being in the Secret Life of Pets is his entree into being in Star Wars.

Yeah, how I got it.

Hey, he's proven that he's working a viable commodity.

At this point, why not?

By the way, my name is Scott Ocherman.

I am the host of this show and...

Oh, by the way.

Mm-mm-mm.

And we're doing the best ofs where this year we're counting down the top 16 episodes of 2017.

Is 16 the most episodes you've done a countdown for?

No, that's an interesting question.

I was looking up a lot of stats last time, but uh, you really are.

Hey, boy, I never realized how interesting Paul was.

Fascinating person.

By the way, speaking of interesting, this is, if you've never listened to the show before, this is the show where we talk to interesting people.

And I believe our countdown will really prove that to be true.

Because a lot of interesting people have passed through these halls and have won.

A lot of boring people, too.

Yeah, I mean, honestly, we're doing a top 16 out of what?

60 episodes?

Yeah.

That's only like a quarter of them.

Yeah.

For rest of it.

We're horrible.

Here's what people should know.

If these episodes that we're going to countdown, clearly the best episodes.

Clearly.

The other ones?

Not bother.

Not worth your time.

Not got a star wars story.

By the way, this is episode one, not got a star wars story.

There it is.

Whompe there it is.

Um, or that's not bad either.

Episode one, Whompe there it is.

How about episode one, Whompe let the dogs out?

Whompe let the dogs out.

Let history be the judge.

Episode one.

Whompe let the dogs out.

Let history be the judge.

Great.

A star wars story.

Um, we, uh, by the way, did you see?

Oh, yes.

You went to the premiere of the new Star Wars.

Oh, did I?

Yes, I suppose I did.

Yeah.

Paul F. Tonkins is a famous actor and comedian and internet personality.

This is yours.

Uh, Rachon tour.

Rachon tour.

He was in the Rachon tours.

That's right.

Um, and playing Jack White.

Jack White was too busy.

He had too many projects going on.

So Paul was like, we're on that crazy mustache.

Hey.

That's what I'm assuming that's what I got.

I know.

This is just my regular mustache.

Did you always want to grow a mustache?

Yeah, I did.

Really?

Yeah.

Ever since you were a little kid?

When I was a little kid, I, mustaches were common when I was a little kid and I thought they were very cool.

As common as the Grammys won by the rapper Common.

That's a, that's a bang bang television show.

Line, I have to admit.

Did it make it to air?

It did make it to air.

Sorry, viewers.

Sorry.

And then, uh, but as I was growing, as I was, you know, able to grow facial hair, it was not a common thing.

When you were able to, yes.

Yes.

No one had mustaches anymore.

So we're talking by the ladies, the late 80s.

That's right by the ladies.

Hey ladies.

Ladies.

What about that for a Beastie Boys reference in Star Wars?

This is Admiral Halades.

It's actually not bad.

And a rep hole, uh, place out.

Halades in the place.

We're calling out to you.

They fit that line of dial.

Admiral Halades in the place.

We're calling out to you.

As you could see, the plans for the Death Star are coming.

You sound really, you should be in one of these films.

I'm telling you.

You went to the premiere at everything, where you like tried out some of these lines on Ryan.

Yeah, it's during the movie.

People were mad.

I bet.

Yeah.

So you wanted to- Daisy Ridley pinched my leg really hard to make me stop.

Really?

Like we were in church.

That's sexual harassment.

Well, she didn't debate it in a sexual way.

Oh, okay.

Still, there's a power dynamic there.

I was the star of the movie.

Now you know my fondness for her.

And I walked past her at one point.

And I was very excited.

Because I had two, um- We talked about this on a previous best of you.

Yes.

Foul proud for her.

Yes.

I love that character.

You love the character.

I, you know, uh- I was watching- I watched the first one the night before.

I watched the night before, first of all.

How was it?

It was a lot of- A lot of disgusting toes.

I have to admit.

What?

But more than 10 or- No, about 10.

Right about 10.

Yeah, right on the money, I believe.

Um, no, I watched the first one the night before.

And then I- That I watched this new one.

And uh- Yeah, boy, that- It's such a- How amazing.

I remember when I was young.

Star Wars was something all the little boys liked.

And I dressed up like Luke Skywalker.

I dressed up like Han Solo.

Uh, and uh, for Halloween.

And uh, then that is our personality.

Oh, it's right there.

Not for Halloween.

Oh, really?

I just did it.

You're sort of dressed up like Han Solo right now.

You're wearing a vest.

You got a white shirt and a vest.

Yeah.

I- My mom made me a costume.

Made me a Han Solo vest.

And I wore, I think, a white turtleneck.

Ah.

Why, you wanted to cover up the old Adam's apple?

Or- Yeah.

Is that the only white girl in the- I wanted to be able to think I was a woman pretending to be a man.

So- It was a whole- Very progressive of you.

It was in Victor Victoria.

Right.

So, um, I- And I had a like a plastic- It's like a Caesar Romero mustache joker thing.

Yeah, exactly.

And I had a, um, I had a, uh, ray gun, you know.

Mm-hmm.

Um, Ronnie ray gun.

Will- Oh no.

Nancy.

And I remember of Nat De- Viva- Yeah.

Uh, what?

He's demotating the other guy?

He- he told George H.W.

George H.W. Bush was- that's where he got it from.

Do you think Reagan thought that impression was hilarious?

Like when he saw Dana Carvey, obviously Ray- I bet- Yes, obviously.

Well, he had nothing else to do.

Yeah.

He's retired.

He's losing his mind.

He's like- Well flip on the old YouTube.

Anyway, so- What?

Musical guest.

So I was trick-or-treating as Han Solo.

And I remember a lady asking me who I was supposed to be.

And I said- Are you a vest guy?

I said Han Solo, and she said, Well, where's Gretel?

Ah, what a dumb old lady.

She's a stupid old lady!

And you still remember her now?

I hope she's dead.

She's decked to see her mind in my home- Oh, oh!

Dead and I hope her children are dead and I hope- Their children are dead!

Guess what they are?

Oh, shit.

I took care of it.

Oh, bruh.

I never forget and I never forgive.

Kill shot.

Straight to the head.

Um- And I have to blame.

So- But what I was gonna say is, when I was- When I was young, it seemed like exclusively little boys like Star Wars.

Do you remember any little girls like in Star- And that's- And that's not me- I don't.

That's not me trying to say like, you could only like Star Wars as a boy.

But it just seemed like it was kind of a guy thing, presumably in the 70s, of where like guys like Star Wars.

But here's what I would say.

Please don't!

I think that- Too late I said it!

Okay.

It's on the record.

Um- I'm backgrounding- I think that like all kids must have been captivated by it, but because your- Your friends are probably a little boys.

Right.

And so- Maybe that's- Maybe you're talking about it with them.

I- It just- I never- But I had friends who were little girls.

That sounds weird.

Um, I- Oh boy.

No, I just don't recall ever hearing like any of my fellow female classmates ever getting excited and saying like, let's talk about Star Wars or whatever.

And- and mainly what I'm trying to say is it- I don't know that there were any characters that they could be excited about- Yes.

portraying on Halloween or- There was one female character.

Yeah.

The whole thing.

Yeah.

I guess, you know, the one interesting thing about Princess Leia and the first one, and certainly is her hairstyle, where you could kind of go- Yeah.

Oh that would be cool.

Star Wars is popular.

I could do my hair in those cinnamon buns.

Okay.

Yeah.

I'll do that for Halloween.

Yeah, yeah.

But it's not like she ever did any- I mean, she had- well, she had a gun.

I don't know.

She kissed Luke- Yeah.

For luck.

She hugged Chewbacca.

After the Death Star was blown up.

But my point is, and this is all coming out like I'm a terrible person probably- He's not like a monster.

To people who were like, I was- I was seven when Star Wars came out, and I loved it.

But I just- I really enjoy seeing Daisy Ridley up there on the screen.

Yeah.

Because she's like doing these amazing lightsaber battles, and she's jumping around- She's fantastic.

She's awesome.

She's fantastic in it.

And it- when I went to Disneyland last year, there were so many girls dressed as her.

Yeah.

Who went to Disneyland dressed as her, because there's Star Wars land, and you get to meet the Stormtroopers and all that.

And I had just never seen that growing up.

It was very much like, wow, this is awesome.

And then I also, in watching the new Star Wars film, I watched it with my ex-girlfriend, my current wife, Coolop.

Sure.

And the former comedy bang bang actress, Kelly Marie Tran, is- That's right.

What is she like, chip?

What is her name?

Yeah, chip.

Chocolate chip?

What is it?

She plays chocolate chip.

No, really.

What is it?

I don't remember- Our bros.

Bros.

Bros before bros.

Yes.

That's a great subtitle for the next Star Wars.

It's Rose.

Yeah. Rose before Bros.

Yeah.

A Star Wars story.

Episode two.

But there were so many great Asian characters in it, and Kelly Marie Tran, which by the way, and I've mentioned this to you, every day for my Google alert for comedy bang bang, there's a new story about Kelly Marie Tran, and it's one of her only credits was comedy bang bang before getting Star Wars.

Right.

And I've told this story to you, but we really liked her on Star Wars.

No, we really liked- No, we really liked her.

No, we really liked her.

We liked her on comedy bang bang.

She was in the- Brody South Dakota episode.

Brody South Dakota episode.

And we really liked her, so we asked her back to be in a different role, and her agent was like, oh, sorry, she's in England doing a movie.

And Neil Campbell laughed and said, ha, it's probably the new Star Wars film.

And we laughed like, ha, that would be funny.

Can you imagine?

Not that she was untalented enough.

There's no way.

But just like how weird that would be if we're- Yeah.

If like doing, you know, and out of anything you could do in England, doing the new Star Wars film would be like, one in a million shots.

Well, it's also even us being in show business and living here, that is still because it's the thing we grew up with.

It's impossible- It's impossible to get into- It's impossible to get into- No, it's like those things that meant a lot to you as a child, and it's like when the first person that I knew who became like an SNL cast member, Yeah.

You know, or these things that just seem out of reach to you, like that'll never happen to anyone, I know.

Yeah.

But it was crazy when it was announced that she was going to be in the new Star Wars.

But my point being that my current wife, Koolop, is an Asian person.

And I saw her getting into Rose and her sister's story and being touched by it in a way that I think that maybe she hadn't even been in Star Wars.

Yeah.

You know, when you read those, the stories about Rogue One and the people who- How I believe Diego Luna's is that his name?

See?

How he has an accent and people with accents were thrilled by that.

And anyway, so it's a wonderful time to be a Star Wars fan, I think, unless you're a jerk on the internet.

Yeah.

Did you enjoy the movie?

I did.

Yeah.

I thought it was very weird.

I thought it was so much fun.

But I don't want to spoil any of it.

I think it's an oddly written movie.

But I did enjoy it.

And speaking of really enjoying it, apparently with the Comedy Bang Bang podcast, people really enjoyed this year because this is the most competitive year.

Is it really?

It has ever been.

Most votes?

Most votes we had close to 40,000 votes, which is- It is insane.

It is insane.

Why are 40,000 people doing this?

I don't understand.

Have I introduced you yet, though?

No.

Aha!

You felt it, right?

I did.

There was a disturbance in the force.

Yes, I'm going to get the marks.

Across from me is a person who has been on the show quite often, and he is always joining me here for these end of the year episodes as himself.

He usually portrays several different characters on the show.

Wow, can we be told?

But on these end of the year best ofs, he is himself, and it is my pleasure to be across the aisle from him once again.

Please welcome Paul F. Tompkins.

Tisha Markoff, Ruth Walkerbund!

You gotta be in one of these films!

You gotta be in one of these films.

You're amazing.

There's hardly any left.

Well, I mean, out of the main ones, don't you think after nine, they're going to be like, Hey, guess what?

10, 11, 12 coming up.

Well, not- I don't know.

I think they will.

I mean, they can.

What's stopping them?

Maybe, I don't know, like George Lucas with- I don't think so, right?

I mean, if they want to remain true to the idea that George Lucas lied about and said was his idea all along.

Right, he did lie about it by the way.

That's no way that he- I remember, in fact, that when pressed on those details- and we're talking a lot about Star Wars on this episode- Sure.

But when pressed on those details, I remember the original trilogy, one, two, and three, was supposed to be exclusively about R2D2 and C3PO.

Yes.

Well, I don't remember- It was going to be like hundreds of years beforehand.

I don't remember that it was supposed to be about them, but that they were the- I remember the- I remember those were the only- Characters that were going to be in all of them.

In all of them, yes.

And that just was thrown out the window.

It was like, I'm really interested in how Darth Vader became evil.

Oh, really?

Oh.

I'm interested in the grain policies.

Oh, boy.

What if that were the episodes 10, 11, 12?

They get back to the grain.

Back to the grain.

Let's get back to these grain policies.

I bet they do do do do do.

There's a character.

Admiral Doodoo.

Actually, isn't it just going to get to like, Bleeplop and Fleetflip?

I don't think it'll ever get to Fleetflip.

I think it will get to Bleepblop, but I don't think it'll ever get as far as Fleetflip.

I just had a hot tea string in my mouth and could not answer with any degree of quickness.

Hello. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Paul of Tomkins is my name.

Paul of Tomkins is here and we're going to be counting down the top 16.

I don't know whether that is the most we've ever done, but what's interesting is in 2015, no, sorry, 2016 we counted down the top 15.

And now in 2017, we're counting down the top 16.

At what point will we catch up?

Well, at this rate never.

That's true.

I doubt we'll be doing 18 episodes next year.

If past is prologue, then there's just no way.

There's absolutely no way we'll ever do it.

So at this point, we'll never catch up.

We may as well not try, but this year we're counting down the top 16.

And this is very exciting.

16 episodes to choose from.

And now Paul, it should be said that you were in a lot of episodes this year.

I actually counted them up.

You were in 11 episodes out of our 60 or so.

And you do not know what episodes made the countdown.

These are always a surprise when I reveal this year.

Always a surprise.

Sometimes hurtful.

Last year may have been especially hurtful to you.

Didn't like it last year.

Right.

Didn't like it.

You were in a few of the episodes.

A few.

But you were not in the top episode.

No.

You did not claim the top spots.

That was a kid detectives too, I believe.

No.

Not a fan.

I get it.

I get why people like it.

It's just so easy.

So you have no idea if you are even in any of these episodes.

I have no idea.

You know what?

My expectations have been lowered.

They have been lowered.

Because of last year.

Good.

So now we can just have fun this year.

Maybe I'm in one.

Sure.

Whatever they happen to be, they happen to be.

I'll still be mad.

Yeah.

This is not a pleasant experience for you to undergo.

Is that right?

No, no.

It's not totally unpleasant.

There's pleasant parts to it.

Okay.

Like when I forget why we're here.

And we're just goofing.

It's fun.

Goof it around.

Well, let's get back to goofing then.

Well, let's not talk about the countdown yet.

Right.

Tell me about your 20.

Is this 20?

It's 2017.

Yes.

2017.

Tell me about your 2017.

How was it this year?

What a year.

Simultaneously went on forever and also flew by at a breakneck pace.

Didn't it?

Doesn't it seem like it just seems like no time has elapsed and yet it's been excruciating?

Yeah.

It flew by, but yet I felt every second of every minute of every hour of this year.

Yeah.

This year, this has been a very odd year.

I think for me, not a lot has been going on.

In terms of professionally, I've been doing the podcast, obviously.

And then we released at the beginning of the year, I was doing the Michael Bolton special for Netflix, which is still on.

You can people can watch it for Christmas.

It has Santa in it.

That's right.

Michael Bolton's big sexy valentine's day.

And we released that in February.

And then I've been working on a lot of stuff behind the scenes that has not come out.

TTS.

And so it's felt like I haven't had much of anything going on career-wise, even though there's been a lot happening behind the scenes, as I said.

And but then personally, I believe just the state of the world every day, it seems like you wake up to new news of political policies that are oppressive to your friends.

And it's, but more than that, it seems like we're living in, they say it as a curse to live in interesting times.

That's right.

It's a Chinese curse.

They'll sign these.

They'll make you live in interesting times.

Man, they knew how to do it.

They sure did.

Remember those gypsy curses that were just like thinner?

Yeah.

But then the Chinese, they knew how to do it.

That's because the thinner you had to touch somebody.

Right.

Yeah.

They like stroke their face.

That was a big part of that movie, thinner.

Yeah.

She's just like casually.

The inner, my dear boy.

But the Chinese curse, you could do it.

You could do it over email.

Yeah.

Re-colon.

Yeah.

Curse.

They live in interesting times.

You could text somebody.

You are?

Curse.

They live in interesting times.

But as a, in the United States here, if you live here, but I know we have plenty of fans out there in Norway, the Canada.

The Germany.

The Germany, the Australia.

But in the US here, it's almost like we've been in this soap opera of, you know, you and I were probably too young to really clock watergate as it was happening.

Yes.

Didn't really understand what was going on.

I remember it sort of hearing about it.

Like people would talk about it and go, Hi, yeah, right.

And you knew it was maybe a scandal.

But then didn't really know exactly what it was about until maybe high school or something like that.

This feels like we're in the, like, I don't, I feel like Aerosmith, I don't want to miss a thing.

Every day I'm just like fascinated by what's going on because, you know, it could be the destruction of the very idea of the presidency.

And much like Aerosmith, I feel like I'm honking on Bobo.

Great point.

And I'm glad we got to it.

But how about you, Paul, for this year?

Personally, been, been.

Personally, a wonderful year.

My wonderful wife and I have a very nice life.

And I got to see a lot of friends.

I stayed home more than I usually do it in travel as much.

That's right. Last year we were out gallivanting across the globe.

That's right.

And this year we did not do a tour.

Homebodies.

Just pure homebodies.

And it was nice.

It was, I made more of an effort to hang out with people and see people.

And it was, I was originally rewarded by that tactic.

I did get to work on some unusual things.

I did an episode of NPC's Blind Spot, which is right.

It was just on a couple of weeks ago.

That's right.

And my sister-in-law texted me very excited about it.

Oh, that's very nice to hear.

I did an episode of Black-ish.

I did that show Life in Pieces that are friend Colin Hanks.

That's right.

Yeah, that's a great show.

All characters were, characters were welcome.

People said all characters were welcome.

But on every show people were like, oh, we got to bring this character back.

And it's like, that won't happen.

Anytime I've guessed it on a show, they've said that.

It's never happened.

I told you about Brooklyn Nine-Nine, where they, where we did Cool Up and I, as well as Eugene Cordaro.

We all did the season finale of season four.

And I caught up with Dangor in the break in between seasons.

And he was like, we've been breaking story here in the writers room.

There is literally no way we can do the season premiere without bringing your characters back.

We have not been able to figure out a way to not have you guys back.

It's not a promise, but I mean, literally, we have to have you back.

Right.

Last I ever heard from it.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

The best was I appeared on the Sarah Silverman program every once in a while.

As a policeman.

As a policeman, Jay Johnston's partner.

And every time I would be there, Harris Whittles, would tell me about all the ideas they had for my character.

Right.

And then none of which ever happened.

Never happened.

Right.

How many episodes did that did you do?

Oh, not that many.

Maybe four?

Maybe not even four.

Really.

I did.

I played two different characters on it.

I was one of my few friends who's put me on their show.

Good old Sarah.

Her show, I love you, America, is out there right now.

A little bit of a plug for her.

It's out there.

It's just like the truth.

Look out your window.

What if that was the way that you had to watch TV?

You had to look out your window.

Yeah, like everyone, for some reason, people were, when the TV was first invented, people were like, let's put these things outside.

But you stay inside.

You stay inside and you have to look out the window.

Can you go outside to watch your only work to do?

It's just not customary.

It's just not what people do.

It's not traditional.

The very first person who put up a TV was like, this is going to look great in the yard.

I feel like it would be difficult because of all the natural light around.

It'd be difficult to see the picture.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You also would probably be tempted to look at the beauty of nature rather than...

Well, that's the thing.

You're thinking, well, I should be out there frolicking around.

Sometimes when I get home and I just come home after a long day, I plop down on the couch, I turn on the TV, sometimes I look just slightly to my left and see like, nature's wonder and we have like a wonderful view.

You do.

And I'll be like, why aren't I looking at that?

Well, you know, we have a missing wall in our home.

So a lot of times...

Have you ever found it, by the way?

No.

A lot of times...

I can't remember if the house is like...

It was there when you bought it.

I think it was there when you bought it because I remember...

I feel like we wouldn't have bought the house if it had a missing wall.

Yeah.

No, I remember going over there and going, I love that wall.

Okay, so you remember seeing it?

Yeah, I remember seeing the wall.

Yeah, and then the last time I was there, I was like, what happened to that wall?

Yeah, the wall's gone.

And so I'll be watching TV and sometimes, you know, like a straight dog will come into the house.

And I think...

I should be out there with that dog running around.

Right, yeah.

I certainly shouldn't be in here with him.

He's terrifying.

He's covered in grease and he's snarling at me.

Why is he covered in grease?

He's been sleeping under cars and stuff.

Hanging out with John Dravolta and Olivia Newton-John.

Don't worry, in grease.

You can just tell he's been watching grease a lot.

Yeah, just covered in it.

All right, so this is what this is.

Paul and I are going to talk, we're going to chat, we're going to count down.

Have fun.

We're going to have fun, we're going to talk about the best of 2017.

Oh, the mood is turning.

Sorry, Paul.

I'm remembering why we're here.

Can I bring the mood back?

What would bring the mood back if you could...

I guess hearing a funny clip.

Hearing a funny clip?

Okay, well, why don't we get to it?

Let's get to, by the way, these are all voted on by you, the listeners, 40,000 votes.

And the eligibility period is Thanksgiving of 2016 to Thanksgiving of 2017.

That gives us a little time to compile the clips and tally up the votes.

Exactly.

So this is your top 16.

Let's get to episode 16.

All right, episode 16.

And you would be interested in hearing a funny clip.

Is that correct, Paul?

Yeah, I like that.

I like funny clips.

All right, well, this episode is...

The one that kicks off our countdown is definitely a funny clip.

Count down, kick off!

Yes, we got a countdown KO.

This is episode 474.

And this is from March 6.

And this is an episode called Liquid Mealsphere.

This sounds familiar to me.

It should sound familiar to you, Paul, because Paul, you are in this episode.

Oh!

Is that the Lion King?

What is that?

No, that's like, it's soccer.

Oh, is that a soccer thing?

I've never watched the game.

I don't even know how it's played.

It's like a soccer chant.

How do you play that game?

I would imagine you pick up the ball and you throw it around.

I don't...

When do you pick up the ball and soccer?

I'm trying to think.

I know there's a hands thing.

I think it's like...

You have to...

There's like a thing you have to say in order to be allowed to pick it up with your hands.

Like, handsy!

Yep.

And then the character of Hansy shows up.

Hey!

Hey, I'm Hansy!

Hits a jukebox.

Yeah, grabs your ass.

Hits a jukebox, which then magically your ass is grabbed.

Like, Hansy.

All right, this is episode 474, the 16th episode on our countdown.

Liquid Mealsphere's, and this episode has Gillian Jacobs.

I was going to say, speaking of sorry.

This episode has Gillie.

She comes on, but once a year, lately.

That's true.

As a matter of fact, I tried to text her about a party I was having about a month ago and never received a text back.

I believe it bounced back.

I think she's changed all of her information.

Oh, dear.

I don't know what's going on.

So we'll have to find that out before love.

She is one of the stars of love on Netflix, and we all remember her from Burt Wonderstone and Community.

And she has been coming on to promote love every year, around the same time every year, and this year she came with the other star and co-creator of Love, Paul Rust.

Rust.

Rust, as we call him.

And Paul was on here, and I don't recall whether this is the regular comedy bang bang debut of this character.

You debuted this character in Portland, I believe, in a live episode.

I don't remember if this is the first time you were on the regular show, but this is Big Chunky Bubbles.

Paul is playing Big Chunky Bubbles.

Big C. B.

Now tell us about Big Chunky Bubbles.

Big Chunky Bubbles is a children's entertainer.

He makes bubbles.

He's a bubble artist, and he makes bubbles.

But with some out of soap.

What?

I don't have soap.

What?

Out of soap?

I'm shaking to my very core.

Out of soups and stews.

He makes big chunky bubbles.

Right.

And he's not a successful children's entertainer in the weeks.

No, he's not.

Well his act is terrible and a little dangerous.

And how?

He's a very unpleasant person.

Because I believe this may be the first time he's ever been on the countdown.

Describe how you came up with this character.

We were on tour in Portland.

By the way, it should be said that if you're listening to comedy bang bang for the first time, and this may be Merry Christmas, this may be some people just got iPods or iPads, and are trying to figure out what a podcast is.

And we were, by the way, very blessed to have been one of the most downloaded podcasts on iTunes this year.

And so maybe you're looking at popular podcasts.

And the show's format is I am the host, Scott Ocherman.

And we have guests on the program.

Some of them are real people.

Some of them are celebrities.

And some of them are comedians playing fake people.

And that's normally what Paul does.

Paul comes on as a fake person.

And this is one of your characters.

This is a character that I made up when we were in Portland.

On that tour, we were doing a city a day for almost a month.

And so we were doing established characters, all of us that were doing characters.

And then after a while.

Lauren Lapkis was also on the tour.

And you were both tracking not only your own characters and what you would do in each city.

And you, Paul, had been tracking it from the two previous tours as well.

Yes. Because you don't like to repeat a character.

I try to repeat as little as possible.

Because if someone say in Chicago has come to see comedy, bang bang, and they love a certain character that you do and you haven't done it, you hope to at some point hit that character for them.

Well, if they're in another city and we've been there before and they say, well, I saw these guys live once before and he did the exact same character.

He did the exact same character.

Yeah. That's something you want.

I would like to mix it up.

Right.

So you were at Google Doc where we were keeping track of what characters we were going to do and we discussed it every day.

Because we wanted to make sure that there would be at least like an old favorite.

Yeah. Because between the two of you, you would sometimes want to try new characters or characters that weren't as established.

But you wanted to make sure that the other person was playing the favorite.

Yeah. And then towards the end, we didn't care anymore.

Right.

But in Portland, which was towards the end.

Paul F. Thompson story.

Towards the end, I didn't care anymore.

That's every project you've ever done.

A Star Wars story.

We were at a restaurant and it was the me, you, Lauren, and Tim Balz was there.

Yes. Tim Balz, my camfer was there as well.

Yes. Tim Balz came on towards the end of the tour for the last few days as we were running out of steam and needed some fresh energy.

And he really helped.

He really helped a lot.

He did.

And so we were at a restaurant and I didn't know what to do.

I was really felt like, oh, I feel like I've done everything so many times.

And we had two shows that night as well.

Yeah.

And this was the most tired we ever were.

Yes. I remember being on stage in the second Portland show.

And this is one, by the way, that Lauren had to, oh, turn that phone off.

What do you say?

Hey.

Thank you.

This was one that Lauren had to leave in the middle of the show because she had an audition the next day in California that she had to get up at four in the morning to fly back to California and then fly back to Seattle to meet us back on the tour.

So I remember being on stage on that second Portland episode.

And was that the one that you were doing Andrew Lloyd Webber on or something?

Yes.

And literally falling asleep.

Me too.

And I've never been in that stage.

No, it was crazy.

It was crazy.

Anytime I wasn't talking, I would start to stop.

I would not have enough.

Yeah.

I've never.

And I think we talked about this when we did commentary on the best of the tour.

That you and I, without talking about it, that second show, we were trying to like, just create energy.

So we were like running around and stuff.

We were trying to role play and like, I think we were like, let's reenact when you got nighted.

That'll get us on our feet and try to get some adrenaline going.

So we were, it was, it was the, it was, we only had a couple of days left on a long, long tour.

We had been away a long time and you were looking for things to do.

And we were at this restaurant and what happened?

There was a description in the menu of something.

It must have been a super issue.

It must have been.

You know, it, I mean, it couldn't have been a charred meat that would have like.

Yeah.

And it was described as having big chunky bubbles.

Which is not appetizing.

No.

And the phrase really leapt out at me.

By the way, I wish we could remember this restaurant so they could put up a plaque or something as the, the genesis of this character.

Absolutely.

But I remember you saying big chunky bubbles.

And I forget if it was your idea or our idea, but we said that should be a character that you do tonight and we dared you to do that as a character.

And you had to come up with this character out of whole cloth.

Yeah.

And it became a huge hit.

It was, that first time was so much fun.

It was a really unpleasant character and a lot of weird stuff came out because I didn't have that much planned for it.

So in the course of the, the interview portion, we learned a lot about him.

Now we set up a lot of your characters, by the way, are very antagonistic towards me.

That's true.

Mainly because that's a fun dynamic to play on stage.

Yes.

And a lot of these have been born out of on stage things.

Yes.

And it's, it's not fun on stage for two people to agree.

You know what I mean?

That's true.

But I have to say that big chunky bubbles really takes the cake in unpleasantness towards me.

He's the most unpleasant.

And I think, I think by the end of a tour where we were doing this once or twice a night, all of your characters being so mean to me started to really wear on me.

I started actually getting insulted by the end.

Well, now here's the thing.

A lot of the characters don't start out unpleasant to you, but they become very frustrated with you.

That's right.

And because of what I'm doing in- It takes two to tango.

I'm doing it intentionally.

Yes.

So I have only myself to blame.

Big chunky bubbles, however, comes pre unpleasant.

He really does.

Out of the box, he's unpleasant.

So we're going to hear some of this episode.

We're going to start off first with Paul Russ doing a little bit of his signature comedy bang bang segment, which he has done throughout the years on the show.

It's always wonderful to have him back doing this.

A little something that he calls new no-no's, which is based on Bill Maher's new rules.

Oh, yes.

And then we're going to then segue into big chunky bubbles coming onto the scene.

This is Liquid Mealsphere's This Is Your Episode 16.

Number one, six.

Well, look, it's safe to say there are things that I don't know how else to say this, but they irk you.

Erk?

How about cheese off?

Oh, okay.

Okay.

How about rattle?

Okay.

How about mint?

Oh boy.

Hey, is there anything you want to say retroactively?

Like start the clock.

Okay.

Keep that clock going.

The clock is started and it shall continue.

So what are we doing here?

What is this?

New no-no's.

Oh, yes.

All right.

Let's see if you remember how to do these guys sit down.

You don't even know it at home.

Uh, new no-no's are eat everybody's got those things that sticks in their crop.

Uh, I set up rules.

New rules.

But they're not- I do some new rules.

No, no, no, they're not new rules though.

I call them new do-do's, but they are new rules.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

Where- Where I, uh, it's my idea of hey, if I ran the world, Scott.

Yeah.

And God save us if you did.

Yeah.

Oh boy.

I would- that what a weird world that would be, right?

Yeah, from the twisted mind of Paul Rust.

Tom's planet Earth.

I've already felt like I've been living in the twisted mind of Danny DeVito.

You know, watching movies like throw mama from the train.

Love it.

Wait, so this is something women like- Women love throw mama.

Don't throw mama.

Throw mama.

Is it don't throw mama Earth?

Don't throw- Throw mama.

They want to throw mama from the train.

But then they don't later on.

Spoiler alert.

Well, throw where my mom will jump.

On the train.

So, noon no no.

Yeah, let's have a Louie.

It's a cousin Louie.

So this is something you're making fun of him for imitating Gandhi in UHF.

And you're imitating- I didn't make fun.

Debatable.

All right.

Back to the new no no's.

You want to- Start the clock.

Restart that clock.

Dude.

Fuck.

No no no.

You guys had to deal with quicksand.

Everywhere I go there's a pile of quicksand.

Look out.

There's some quicksand.

I'm sorry.

Last time I checked that sound wasn't- That sound- Sand.

That sound- That sand wasn't quick.

It moves very slow.

You get sucked down at a slow pace.

How about quicksand is fast sand so you die quicker?

New no no.

Fast sand.

Okay.

New no no.

Bricks.

This is hot.

People always complaining.

Why is a brick gotta be square?

Why is it gotta be a little right to the shape of a rectangle?

Okay, closer.

Well for all those winers and complainers.

I got an idea.

Bricks that are circles.

New no no circle bricks.

Is this just an idea for a product?

New no no.

Okay.

Is anybody else had enough to hear with fire hydrants?

Oh yeah.

Yeah.

Every corner I turn, every street I'm on, I gotta go look at a fire hydrant.

And guess who only gets to use them?

Firemen, right?

Yeah.

Well uh I got a little idea.

I got a little notion.

I got a little hair up my tiny little asshole.

I think in addition to firemen using fire hydrants.

Firemen's kids should.

You know no.

The kids run the hydrants now.

I like that one.

So what big chunky bubbles?

What are you up to now?

I mean obviously I haven't seen you in a few months.

Have you been out there entertaining the children?

Or you're always an innovator.

You always have things going on.

It's been a really foul appearance for old big chunky bubbles.

Yeah.

I haven't had any gig.

Kids not having birthdays in these months?

They seem to be having birthdays, but I don't seem to be hired to entertain them.

What's your website like what's your online presence?

Do you have a landing page?

I do have a landing page thanks to Squarespace.

Sure.

I didn't even know what it was or what it did, but it came for free.

And I was like all right good.

Free with the service.

So yeah what's it like though?

Do you have is your phone number there?

Is there a way to contact you?

I mean I tried to do something artistic with it.

And so my website my official home page is basically it's a treasure map.

To the information.

That's the treasure at the end of the trail.

Okay and how do people solve this?

Stroke that treasure.

How do you keep saying stroke?

Because treasure trail I just thought of dicks.

I don't know.

Are you constantly thinking of dicks?

Not always, but sometimes.

So how do you solve the treasure map?

What I mean is it.

There's a list of three dozen instructions.

Oh boy.

That's way too much.

I advise people to print it up.

People don't want to print up a website in order to solve a well they don't want to contact me.

Well they don't and see you were seeing what's happening.

Your business is just lying fallow.

I'm an artist and I try to make everything I do artistic.

Well something shouldn't be artistic.

Something should be simple right?

What?

Me one thing that shouldn't be artistic.

Sometimes soup.

Sometimes this most simple of soups.

A broth.

What do we think of broths?

Broths is like the precursor to a soup.

Boom.

It's like what a soup could be but you have to put a bunch of stuff.

It's just you know water.

Basically it's chicken flavored water or whatever.

At what point does something become a soup from a broth?

When you put one thing in it?

Like a stone.

Yeah anything like well if you put some chicken in it is it then is it a soup?

If you put one piece of chicken is it a chicken soup?

No.

How many multiple pieces of chicken?

That's a garnish of it's just one piece of chicken.

So two pieces of chicken.

Minimum five.

You know your soups.

I have to admit.

I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit.

I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit I have to admit.

Wait I'm having an idea here.

Uh oh.

When I was a child.

Someone hired a clown for my class seats birthday party.

Eww how original.

But hear me out.

At the end of the party he revealed to the birthday girl's grandmother that he was also a stripper.

So I was thinking maybe you could have this as a true story.

Hold on.

Did in front of the children he revealed this?

I heard it.

And how did this come up to say oh BTW.

I also could end the day by stripping right now if you were to pay me extra.

Granny yes.

Okay and did we call her granny?

Did she take him up on it or?

You don't know.

I don't know.

I went home.

Okay.

I kind of thought that he was going to end up stripping at this party.

That's extra.

He was going to be instantly engaged in a second capacity.

I met that guy before.

That clown.

Really?

Yeah.

And I was like how do you figure it out?

Like you got to do two different things.

Seems like it's complicated.

There must be a lot of paperwork.

And he said no it's very easy.

I just go you want the bozo or the blow Joe.

He would be the one receiving the blow Joe.

So not a lot of paperwork then.

Zero.

So begillie why were you?

Why did you bring this up?

Well I think that you should really expand your notions of your operation here.

Well for your information miss.

I'm not only a bubble artist that is my primary art it's true.

But at the end of every party I let any grandmothers know.

By the way I also can sculpt things out of meat.

Sculpt out of meat.

Yeah.

That's great.

I'm not trying to stand in the way of your meat sculptures.

Good because you can.

I would simply suggest that in addition to offering soup bubbles at parties you have a clown there.

He could really.

Wait you want to find this clown who's a stripper is that what I'm getting at?

You're just looking for this clown that's a stripper that excited you so much when you were a kid.

Yes.

You've been searching for this clown ever since.

Been thinking about it non-stop.

Okay look no I want to hear about the.

I want to hear about the meat sculptures.

You make meat sculptures.

I take the biggest hunk of me I can find.

How big are these hunks of meat that you're usually find like a rack of ribs or what are you doing?

Oh like a side of beef.

Side a full side of beef.

If I can get my hands on one sure but it's expensive.

Right so you're bringing these you're not saying hey what what meat do you have around the house.

Well they don't always want the meat sculpture so it'd be foolish for me to bring my own meat there every time. Right so I usually ask if you happen to have a side of beef I'd be happy to make a sculpture for you.

And what kind of thinking you make out of a side of beef?

You ever seen the Eiffel Tower?

I have let me see I went to Paris.

I stayed right there in the middle of Paris.

Scott I forget it.

Forget it.

Why Paris?

Oh Paris great.

Was that a play on the famous movie everyone knows?

You're on fire Paul.

Everyone's favorite Billy Crystal Deborah winger movie.

I really wondered what it would look like.

I was told we all will always have Paris that's just the saying.

All right Eiffel Tower you saw the Eiffel Tower.

I did see the I'm remembering now I saw the Eiffel Tower.

It was an Eiffel.

Is there a Gazzle?

He came here.

Oh what's going on right now?

So happy.

Like a virus it's spread to Gillian.

So look so you make you make the Eiffel Tower.

Yes I would be reset everything I ever say.

What you all you said was you ever heard of it.

We go up down this laughing taffy road and then you come back to me and you're like what are you all about again?

That's the whole show.

Every time.

Yes.

Would listen to them.

What if you had a dog that also made bubbles but they were fart bubbles?

Getting back to my earlier point.

Are you looking for ideas?

Is that what this is?

He's not how many words.

Is this like shark tank we're supposed to be pitching you things?

Why are you mad at me?

I thought that you came in here wanting to talk about something.

I did and then this one keeps telling me first she's going to be my competition.

She's pitching me ideas.

I got everybody involved all these other people and animals.

Do you have a dog by the way?

I used to have a dog.

Oh what happened?

Can you take a guess?

I died.

Wait but from soup?

Yeah.

Oh no.

Dogs love meat soups.

They love it.

Yeah they love nothing more than meat.

It gets them crazy.

And they love.

They love.

They love some vegetables too sometimes.

Yeah sometimes I mean some dogs just eat anything you put in front of them.

Yeah.

And so what happened?

Well I was practicing a new bubble.

Oh the bubbles are in shapes of things that exist already or just in strange oblong shapes that look cool.

There's only so many shapes you can make a bubble go into.

Well you could do like a Mickey Mouse where it's like one big bubble and two bubbles on top.

I've done it.

Yeah right right.

Do you get sued by the Walt Disney Corporation if you do a Mickey Mouse soup bubble?

They've tried but I say here's the thing.

I always say oh it's just a coincidence that wasn't supposed to look like that.

It's their fault for Mickey.

Mickey looks like something.

That's right.

I say why how come nature is not suing you for Mickey Mouse looking like three bubbles together?

But no mouse looks like Mickey Mouse so nature can't sue Walt Disney Corporation.

Exactly and that's why they don't probably.

So you're making a new bubble and it exploded on your.

It looked like a cat head.

Oh no that's.

I made as close as I could two triangular bubbles on top of a spherical bubble.

Wow.

My little dog.

Just chased after it.

Damocles he went crazy for it.

Damocles he landed right in the vat of soup.

Oh no.

He's terrible.

It smelled delicious.

You didn't eat the soup.

Of course not.

Okay he never eats soup Scott.

Okay.

There are two reasons not to.

I don't like soup and also my dog was in there.

Oh.

Oh boy what an epi.

What an epi.

What an epi pen.

Someone say epi.

Oh my gosh he's classic Charles.

I thought I heard the name of the sword being mentioned.

Oh my god we hardly ever get to see you anymore Charles.

You came on about a month ago for the new listeners.

Charles has been wondering the hallways here for years.

I can't find my way out.

And he can't find his way out and he just comes.

He's an ezept.

And he has a very small throat.

That's right the opening to my throat is very small so it takes a lot of effort to bush words out.

Is your throat big but the opening is small?

My throat's regular size.

Regular size.

Yeah.

You've measured it and it's all.

I'm measuring every day to see if it gets bigger or smaller.

Right but it stayed the same.

Stay the same.

And eventually at some point are you not going to be able to breathe anymore or you just turn blue?

You'll just turn blue.

That's what you know that's in fruit Charles.

And do you want us to like have a spare ballpoint pen at the ready so we can stab you in the throat or something to try to clear the airway?

From mash?

Yeah sure.

That one episode where Father Mulkey has to do the tracheotomy.

Why would he do it?

He was out.

Seems like a Hawkeye thing to me.

They weren't together.

It was just Father Mulkey in this wounded soldier.

Remember when Hawkeye before he joined the Avengers he was on mash?

Yeah.

Anyway Charles what are you doing here today?

Oh don't get out of here.

Oh okay it's so good to see you.

That's a good sound of a door slamming.

Wow that sure is.

You were stunned speechless by that Paul.

I've never seen such a person.

He comes by every once in a while I think we've seen him six times or so.

What was the last time you were there?

I've never seen.

I feel like he was here when Sarah Silverman was on a few weeks back.

Yes yes that's right.

I gave her a chance to check her phone.

Which she then did quite frequently throughout the episode.

Although she was into it it's just some people you got to check your phone.

There's a lot of business.

Some people you got to check your phone.

No honestly we are so grateful to have anyone who decides to come on this show.

A lot of people say like hey why don't you have this person on more?

Or why did you do this episode without this person or what have you?

The way the show is booked it's very difficult to book because it's an hour and a half of someone's time.

Sarah Silverman she's in the middle of production on her show.

I love the America.

She had to check emails because you can't be out of commission for that long.

There's people saying like what do you think of these drapes for the set?

Exactly.

What do you think of this couch cushion?

So we're just anyone any episode that you listen to is just merely because those were the people who were available.

They're all like 10th choice.

Look we have to take a break.

That was a fun funny bit of business.

You liked it.

Big chunky bubbles always great.

Gillian a wonderful addition to the Bang Bang universe.

Think about her making it's going to be soon her final appearance on the show.

That's right because it will be the final episode of love and we will never have her back.

We'll never see her again.

She's retiring after that right?

From us I think.

Okay good.

All right look let's take a break.

When we come back we're going to have episode 15 and we will have the debut the comedy Bang Bang debut of a very popular character.

So that's very interesting.

So we'll be right back with more comedy Bang Bang after this.

Comedy Bang Bang we are back best of 2017 part one.

What was that?

Naga da.

Let history be the judge a Star Wars story.

I'm here with Paul F. Tomkins.

And well that's pretty good.

So in the top 16 you're in one episode.

That's pretty good.

You're calling it right now?

You're not in any any more.

Is that true?

No of course that's not true.

Honestly you don't know.

You were in 11.

That is very true.

You were in 11 episodes.

You know you're in one at least.

How many out of the top 16 of your 11 do you think that you?

How many let's let's just take a shot.

No come on just take a guess.

It's embarrassing no matter what.

Just take a guess.

Two.

It's more than two.

We're not going to do prices right though.

Naga da.

Let's get to the next episode on our countdown and this is episode 15.

All right episode 15.

This is interestingly enough the last episode Liquid Mealsphere's was from March 6th.

This is from the 6th of the previous month just four weeks earlier, February 6th.

This is Quiz Knows what Quiz did episode 469 up top.

Do you still get to do 69 jokes when there's a 469?

I don't think so.

No really it just has to be 69 proper.

It's got to be just 69 proper.

Goddamn it.

I know.

It's even fair.

I know.

It's like what that's why people.

Well because then what of it was like 690 you know what I mean?

I mean honestly.

It's not it's not pure.

Then you'd have 690, 691, 692.

Like all the 69 jokes that could be made.

By the way how did that ever become like the greatest sex joke of all time?

Like I mean it's pleasurable, 60, but it's more trouble than it's worth.

It's pleasurable certainly.

We've all done it a bunch.

What was the last time and this is a serious question.

What was the last time you 60 nights?

Oh it's been a long time.

Been a long time.

All right this is Quiz knows what Quiz did.

Let me run down your participants on this episode.

This is John Hodgman.

John Hodgman.

Jay Ho.

Jay Ho is that what his friends call him?

Yeah sure.

And that's what the public can call him if you can catch him on the streets.

And if you do you get his gold.

John Hodgman made the first of two appearances that he made on this program in a calendar year.

That's the most he's ever done in a year right?

I believe so.

Yeah usually we get him once every other year or something but he I don't even know why he was here in the beginning of the year.

The second episode he was on he was promoting his new book.

I bet he was first promoting his tour.

Oh possibly yes.

Where he's performing what would become the book.

Right now he is in my opinion of the guests who are themselves just celebrity guests who play along.

He is the quintessential good comedy bang bang guest.

Oh interesting.

He plays along very well.

He adds to the fun a lot.

He is very funny himself and can set up others to be funny.

Always a pleasure to have him on the show and this one by the way.

This was I've been tracking the voting I believe voting was up for maybe a month or so.

Well I've been tracking Santa.

Oh really you on your Santa tracker?

Very close.

He was supposed to come last night.

Oh shit.

Did he forget?

Did you when you were opening presents this morning was anything there?

Maybe this thing is broken.

Oh shit you got to fix your Santa.

This says he's over China.

Oh wait did he text you a curse from China?

Oh let me see here what do you say?

Oh Santa.

Why would he do it?

You rap scallion.

Is it rapscallion or scallion?

Rapscallion.

Rapscallion so it is scallions are part of this.

Yeah why are scallions in in an insult?

They're the only vegetable that can rap.

What was some of their famous raps?

Well my name is on unanimous here to say it's fun to rap in a scallion way.

That's right.

Yes that's right.

Okay so John Hodgman is on this show.

We also have Zeke Nicholson.

Zeke Nicholson is playing Dr. Green.

Now Dr. Green is a character who is a medical doctor out on the Venice boardwalk whom everyone thinks must be a weed seller because of his name and because he's from Jamaica.

He insists that he is not.

He insists he is not.

He's just a regular he's a psychiatrist.

But he's very frustrated by the situation.

And this is the debut of Carl Tarte as chief.

Oh wow this episode is the debut of chief.

And this was a very late I've been tracking the voting as I said.

And this got a late surge of voting.

I think a lot of people in the last two weeks were voting for this episode.

They were reminded how good it was.

And they shot up and frankly it caused some of the ones at the bottom of our countdown to go down.

Never to be heard from again.

Oh damn.

You can talk about that.

You took them off the feed right?

Yeah.

We will.

No one will ever listen to these.

So we're going to hear the debut of this character.

Both of the Zeke and Carl have been superstars for the show this year.

Yeah.

What are you doing it right next to the mic?

What are you talking about?

You're doing this intentionally.

What the fuck with me?

I'm doing it.

Why would you say that?

I don't like it.

Zeke and Carl, great guys.

Great guys.

They're wonderful improvisers from the UCB theater here in Los Angeles.

They're on an improv team called White Women.

And they're great guys and they did the show a lot this year, including our live show that we just did at the PCAST Blast.

That was so much fun.

They were really fun to do it with.

And this is the first episode.

Carl just kind of came in with this idea.

He was like, oh, I'm going to play chief from the Carmen Sandiego show.

I didn't really know what it was.

But it has captured America's heart and imaginations.

So let's hear it.

This is your episode 15.

Number one, five.

Well, we have to get to our next guest.

She is a business woman.

And I'm always interested in talking to business.

I wonder if it's a small business woman or a large business.

I'm always interested when someone has the gumption to start thing.

I mean, Dr. Green, you're a businessman.

So I mean, you'll have a lot to talk about here.

Please welcome chief.

Greetings and salutations, Gumshoe.

Oh, hi.

Hi.

Hi chief.

Very nice to meet you.

This is Dr. Green.

This is John Hodgman.

Hello, Gumshoes.

What's that word that you keep saying?

Gumshoe.

Gumshoe?

Yes.

It's a kind of a detective like Johnny Hunchman.

Okay.

Yeah.

I know what a Gumshoe.

Maybe you're just talking to Johnny Hunchman over there.

No, I'm talking to all of you Gumshoes.

Okay.

Well, I don't know that I'm.

You are now a part of Acme Industries.

That is the business that I am in solely based on finding Carmen Sandiego.

International thief.

Right about right amok.

Common Sandiego.

Gumshoe.

Okay.

Wow.

Okay.

We've been enlisted.

I guess so.

Yeah.

Carmen Sandiego.

That name is ringing a bell for me.

Although I can't quite place it.

She's a thief.

She's been all around the world and I need you all to find her.

Okay.

Gumshoes.

Okay.

Acme Industries, you say?

Yes.

Is that a private detective agency?

It is.

Okay.

Gumshoe.

Got it.

Great.

You're already on the cake.

Not a governmental arm.

Not a member of the intelligence community.

No.

If we actually have a caught Carmen Sandiego, we'd be arrested.

What?

Hey, I don't want to catch her then.

Yeah, I don't want to.

Toulate.

I don't, you're all in Gumshoes.

I don't have a lot of motivation at this point to do my job all that well.

What if I showed you this picture of her?

Oh, that would be helpful because I recognize the name from something.

I can't remember what it is.

I'll show you a picture of the international thief, Swindler, Swindlant, Carmen Sandiego.

Swindlant.

Do you mean Dingbat?

Or...

No, Swindlant.

She loves playing baseball on the island of Cuba.

Oh, that's my name.

That's my name.

No, it's not.

You're a good company next to our name.

I don't think so, Gumshoe.

Try again.

Oh, wait a minute.

Oh, that's your chance.

Yeah, wearing a red, a sort of fedora, a red fedora, and a red jack- French coat.

But under that red jacket, I too supple breast that I had not found.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

What is your motive exactly for trying to find...

Chief, is that your name?

Yes.

That's your Christian name.

Yes.

Do you have a surname?

Or is that your surname?

That is it.

That's it.

That's all we have.

Just chief.

That is all my name is.

It's chief.

It's like a chair.

Because I'm the chief of Aqme Industries.

Is it chief like chair or the chief like the edge?

Jot chief.

All right.

Okay.

And you say it's chief because you are the chief of Aqme Industries.

What was your name previous to that?

Chief Junior.

Okay.

Did you inherit your title?

Yes.

From your mother?

My mother.

Who is a single mom?

Aww.

Found in Aqme Industries.

For me to catch the worldwide common thief, Carmen Sandiego.

Oh, Torius, swing that.

Mm-hm.

And your mother wanted you to catch Carmen Sandiego, but it seems your motivation is to take off her jacket.

She'd be looking for them.

Sub-all movies.

Sub-all breasts of a thief.

I don't know where she stole them from.

Maybe from God above.

By that beautiful...

I never really thought about that.

I guess our body is sort of our stolen thing.

God, when it was in a pool looking up and me got inspired by God, I was like, oh, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, sometimes boomers.

I like the theological implications that we have stolen our bodies from God.

I do like that.

And God wants them back and that's why we die.

God wants them back and that's why we die.

And he finally catches us.

Right.

And God, by the way, is a terrible detective.

Yeah.

Because even though he's omnipotent and omniscient, he can't be like, I don't know where those guys are.

Either that or babies who die are very clumsy at hiding their tracks.

Now, me and Mel was not a clumsy baby.

That's a shirt.

Babies who die are clumsy at hiding their tracks.

Agree that.

So wait a minute.

You like her boobs because she's a thief?

That's not the point of this.

She's a thief.

She has gone around the world.

It seems like it's the point of this.

She's gone around the world shaking that beautiful round bottle.

Oh, okay.

But what exactly has she stolen?

I mean, if you want me to find her, Johnny Huntsman World's Greatest Detective.

Millions of world artifacts, Gamshoo.

I'm glad you asked, Johnny.

All right.

I think you're going to be my star pupil of this round of Gamshoo's.

Wait, there's rounds?

Yes, of course.

She's always stealing something else and we can never seem to catch her.

This seems like an exercise in futility.

What?

Nothing.

So she steals world artifacts?

Yes.

Like what are some of these artifacts like the Statue of Liberty?

Recently, Commons San Diego was spotted on the Mississippi River stealing the Grand Arch of St. Louis, the gateway to the west.

Whoa.

That's quite a height.

She always has helpers in every town she goes in.

Ah, west of that, we call it vibrate.

Let me just say that if she is capable of mobilizing a team of helpers to steal the San Diego, excuse me, the San Diego.

The San Diego.

You're mistaking the gateway to the west, her surname for what she stole.

If she has a legion of helpers that she can mobilize to steal the St. Louis Arch, that's she, I don't think three guys on a podcast are going to be able to catch her.

Oh, but you're wrong, Mr. Hoffman.

She can be caught and she will be caught because she leaves a trail everywhere she goes.

For example, in St. Louis when she stole the gateway to the west, the big arch of St. Louis.

We know it.

She left a pair of nice, victorious, secret thong panties.

Gross.

I don't, I'm really wondering why.

I'll get her.

Why, do you have any authority to catch her?

Why, I mean, it sounds like you're just like attracted to this woman and you want to date her.

I am authorized by Acme Industries LLC.

You started that.

Once again, a private company, not, not a member of the law enforcement of any kind.

A citizen's arrest of some sort.

It's a citizen's harassment.

Yeah.

Ask your quick question.

Please.

Some remember a while back that Cameron Sanke Diego, she moved beyond just traveling around the world, stealing stuff.

She moved to traveling in time and stealing stuff.

In time, really?

We're in time as Cameron Sankego.

Not my jurisdiction.

Not, there's a different- I know this time cop.

I am not a time cop.

I only stay in this realm and run my company, Acme Industries Gumshoe, but great, inquisitorate question.

Okay.

I love those types of questions.

But what if Cameron Sankego, you'll be looking for her on this, in this realm?

And she'll be in a different time period.

Oh, she'll be here.

She'll be here.

I smell her when I go to sleep at night.

I have a bag of her hair.

Where did you get that?

I almost- Someone would have had you shaved her.

She shaves herself.

And she leaves the trampoline.

Where's that hat?

That's one of the clues she left.

She shaves the side of her head like a modern day millennial girl.

She's cool.

You know, she went ahead.

Her long hair is just connected to the hat.

Oh, okay.

It's fake hair.

Oh, all right.

How did you know that?

How did you know that, Gumshoe?

Are you holding out?

Are you one of her minions?

I knew it from the beautiful island of Jamaica, where she has been caught on a Bobsled team in the 1988 world, Winter Olympics.

Yeah, that's right.

Carmen Sandiega was- It was inspired the John Candy character.

Yes, she was the coach.

How did you know that?

Oh, Gumshoe, we're getting so much closer to finding this woman.

What are you going to do when you catch her?

I'm going to lock her up in our basement and suddenly kiss her golden thighs.

Oh, no.

Wait, can I ask you something, Chief?

What about women?

You know, what about women that are acquaintances already of yours?

Or maybe dating sites?

What are you inferring?

I'm implying something.

I don't know what I'm inferring.

I'll tell you what I'm inferring is that you're in love with Carmen Sandiega.

I'm no lesbians, God, Hockerman.

You're not.

No.

Why?

Then why?

I can't- I have no time for a sexual relationship with anyone.

So your a- My job totally surrounds me catching Carmen Sandiega, Gumshoe.

So your asexual like Jughead?

Yes, like just like Jughead.

Do you know Jughead, by the way?

It was the movie about the Marines.

Starting Jug-Jill and Hock.

Ah, yes.

So good.

So, so good.

Very funny.

Lots of laughs.

Lots of L.L.

Lots of laughs.

Yes, absolutely.

Absolutely.

Good guys.

I'm glad that they're on the countdowns.

Yes.

Zeke and Carl.

Absolutely.

I'm glad they're represented.

They were hilarious this year and there's so much fun to play with.

And yeah, it was so much fun to do that live show with them with Carl doing Chief and Zeke doing the movie.

Oh, grief.

Yes, that's a different character that Zeke does that they play together really well.

And you know, as the show progresses, we've been doing it now eight and a half years.

The people who used to do it all the time at the beginning, they get too busy.

And so we all...

Not me.

Nope, you're still around.

I always seem to have plenty of time.

Hey, you did a blackish this year, though.

And wait, was Bajillion, by the way, was it all filmed prior to the beginning of the calendar year?

Or did you have a...

Yeah.

I think...

Oh, I don't even know.

Yeah.

So...

No, there was... We did talking head stuff because I had a fake beard.

Oh, right.

Yeah.

So that was after the holidays, yeah.

Season four, hopefully, will be out there at some point.

But seasons one through three, available on iTunes.

There you go.

It's right now.

We're too late.

But it's always great to have new people coming in and being big hits with the listeners because then...

I don't know, people enjoy the show.

I don't know where I was going with that.

It keeps the show young.

Keeps the show young.

You make me feel so young.

All right. Let's take a break.

When we come back, we are going to have your episode 14.

And this episode is...

This episode has a personal connection to me.

A very personal connection to me.

Are you on it?

I am on it.

Yes, that's what I'm trying to say.

Actually, yeah.

All of these episodes have a personal connection to me.

All right.

We're going to be right back with your episode 14.

This is Comedy Bang Bang.

Comedy Bang Bang.

We are back.

Best of part one.

By the way, if you're wondering about our schedule for the rest of the year, part one is today, Christmas Day.

And then part two will be this Thursday.

Part three will be on New Year's Day.

And then part four will be...

Oh, yes, day!

That's right.

Bono has come by with the studio.

It's so good to see him.

What a pleasure it is to be here.

Simultaneously a good Irish accent and not really sounding like Bono.

Oh, here's the expert.

Ha ha ha, Mork.

So the following Thursday will be part four.

And then we're back to next year on the...

What would that be?

The eighth?

We're back to our regular schedule.

Yeah.

Yes, the eighth.

All right.

So we have gotten to that point in the countdown where we go to the next episode.

It happens in every countdown, let's be honest.

But this is that time.

This is your episode 14.

All right, episode 14.

This is episode 489.

Do you know which episode this is?

No, of course you don't.

Why are you keep asking me?

This is from May 29th.

Does that give you any?

It sure doesn't, Scott.

It sure doesn't.

Do you remember anything that happened in right after May 29th that may give you a clue?

Well, let's see.

No.

Okay, well, let me clue you in because I believe at the beginning of June, a little...

Thank you very much, my dear boy.

A little television program called Bajillion Dollar Properties premiered season three.

Oh, shit.

And this is the episode called The Bajillion Dollar Properties Elevator Pitch.

Yes.

And Paul, this is your second episode.

I'm very excited.

This is one of my favorite times here in this studio.

Really?

Tell us about that.

Now, okay, first let me talk about the participants.

You have Paul here playing Orph Bergen track.

And we have the cast, most of the cast, all but Ryan Goll, who was off shooting something, I believe.

Most of the cast of Bajillion Dollar Properties who have all become wonderful superstars on this podcast.

Tim Bolts, Dan Adou, Drew Tarver, Mandelmond, Tani Newsom, Eugene Cordaro, and I mentioned the episode was personal to be my ex-girlfriend, Kullap Vee Lysok, who is also on this episode.

The creator of Bajillion Dollar Properties.

Yes.

And tell me about this episode.

We, of course, invited everyone to do it, and everyone but Ryan could do it, which is a lot of people.

Yeah.

And this is one of your favorites.

Tell me about it.

I knew that we were all going to be doing it, and so I texted everyone.

There's an extensive Bajillion Dollar Properties text thread.

Now this has been going on since the first season, right?

Yes.

You guys all got your numbers, and I've seen some of it from Kullap.

There's a very long, years-long text thread between nine people.

Yeah, and we text each other frequently.

Quite frequently.

It's really, it's a delight.

And I am not, although I was executive producer, was, I've never been invited to this text chain.

No, and we never thought to.

And so I texted everyone and said, do you want to do like a group thing where we could all, rather than have other than characters, yeah?

I introduced a lot of times when we have a lot of people on the show, everyone will be playing separate characters, and they will be introduced individually one by one.

Yeah.

So this gave everyone a chance to participate equally, but not have to go through like the so much laying of pipe of who are you, and what's your deal.

Right.

So we could all be a family, and then we could each have our individual quirks.

Individual quirks.

And you are playing the Bergen track family familial band.

That's right.

Which is a based sort of on the Tractenberg.

That's right.

Slideshow players.

Yeah.

Sort of a partridge family type thing as well.

It's a family that is very generous.

That is all in a musical combination.

Yeah, it was a mom and dad and a little girl, and they had these slides that were from an old like, Oh, sorry.

Yes.

Oh.

This is the Tractenberg.

This is what it's based on.

Yeah.

And they were.

Oh, I see why you said very generous.

I was talking about the Bergen track.

Oh, yes.

I see.

Yes.

Okay, got it.

So they showed these slides that were from, I think like a McDonald's corporate thing.

They would, as the lore goes, I believe they would find people selling slides in garage sales.

Like these carousels of the slides, and they would buy them, and then write songs to the slides that they would find.

Yeah, and the little girl played drums.

Right.

And then it was forced to play drums.

It's for what it seemed like.

And it was an adorable thing.

I never saw them before.

I saw them live once.

I saw them at the very end of their show at Bumbershoot one year.

Whereas I, because I meant to see them, because I'd heard so much about them.

And then somebody said, Oh, they're on right now.

And he's like, What?

And I ran to the theater.

I was on chase by ghost.

I ran to the theater and got there in time for like the very last notes.

Mountain trip to Japan.

Yeah, exactly.

And people went nuts.

And I was like, well, I guess I missed that.

The lead singer was sort of a Fred Armisen character type.

Yes.

And the little girl, who knows if she grew up well adjusted and enjoyed playing drums?

I think she's arrested for murder.

Really?

Who's murder?

Yes.

Okay.

Keely Smith.

Nicole Brown Simpson.

She's the real killer.

Whoa.

Did OJ catch her?

No.

It's the too busy playing golf.

It's the great it happened right before he got paroled.

Oh man.

Was he on the case though?

Woody of Codders?

He was on the case as much as he could be from prison.

Right.

Yeah.

Amazing.

So she murdered Nicole Brown Simpson.

Yeah, that's why they were just a little bit of a joke.

So that's the backstory of that's what you pitched to the group of, hey, what if we were to all do this?

Yeah.

This is a busy chaotic episode.

A lot of people talking.

But a very popular episode.

This was consistently voted on from the beginning of voting being open to the end.

I'm very glad to hear that because I love these guys and it was so much fun to do this together.

They really make me laugh and we have such a great time when we're all together and this was a ball to do.

This was a literal ball.

Yeah.

You were all literally.

We were in a ball.

In a ball.

Yeah.

Well, you do.

It's very hard to mic you guys up.

Yeah.

It was like a big hamster ball.

And we were all in it.

We were all in it.

It's made of hard plastic.

We bumped into the walls.

Is there soft plastic?

Yeah.

All right. Let's hear it. Let's hear your episode 14.

This is the bajillion dollar properties elevator pitch episode 14.

Number one.

Four.

The group is the Bergen track family familial band.

That's right.

And please welcome Orfe Bergen track.

Hey, thanks for having us on the show.

It's my pleasure to meet you.

Thank you. It's nice to meet you as well.

You know, we don't get asked to do a lot of this stuff.

Do you need to clear your throat before we continue?

No, just did it.

That's it. That's the only one you're ever going to do.

Well, I can't promise that.

Why do you throw it's get?

Why do we need to re-clear them?

Is this a science show?

This is not a science show.

This is not professor blast off.

I'm not preparing to answer science questions.

Orfe.

That's what an interesting name.

Orfe for Orfeus.

Orfeus like Orfeus descending.

Sure. I don't know.

You don't know.

It's a mythology thing.

Okay.

It's like the guy that blew out the sun or whatever.

He blew out the sun.

Why is the sun still there?

If he blew out.

I don't know.

Look, I didn't expect to be answering a lot of questions.

Well, I mean, it's your name.

This is like- You didn't expect to be answering questions?

Well, like these kinds of questions.

This is like your jeopardy, you know?

I see.

Well, I mean, some would think that it's your name and you would know a little bit about the history of it.

But I- Well, my parents died when I was very young.

How young?

Well, they both died in my childbirth.

So when you were a new person.

Yeah.

They died.

So your mother- My mother was dying a child birth.

My father saw where this was going and he just took himself out.

Really?

Yeah.

Like with a- I mean, this is probably painful for you.

I don't want to- Yeah, it's fine.

I mean, I never met these people.

So what do I care?

I mean, you probably met them once.

Not that I recall.

I mean, I'm assured that we have met.

Right, right.

You know.

But they probably mean as much to you as the doctor or who slapped your bare little butt.

Yeah.

That guy still keep the touch right.

Oh, really?

He's one of the name of your face.

What's his name?

His name is Orpheus.

His name, you have to- Really?

Yeah.

The exact same name.

Yep.

Okay, are you a junior or I guess you can't be because you're- No, I have my parents' last name.

Okay.

What is their- Bergen track.

Bergen track.

Okay, and what's the doctor's last name?

His last name is Gishel.

Gishel?

Gishel.

Orpheus Gishel.

Gishel.

What an interesting name.

What is his- Is there a tage?

I think it is.

It's not when you hear a lot.

What's his heritage?

I know he's from Maine.

You keep in touch with this man for the past 62 years.

Yeah.

And you sort of- We mostly talk- No, he's from Maine.

Yeah, we mostly talk about baseball.

Or it.

Okay, well, who do you like this year?

I mean, the Yankees are in first place right now.

I love the Yankees, America's team.

So we're a band.

We're multimedia.

We sing songs and we show slides of cave paintings.

And the idea is- We talk about how the lives of the cavemen would be today in modern times.

I see.

And these are old cave paintings?

No, the brand name.

So new cave paintings about old cavemen?

No, about new cavemen.

About new cavemen.

I didn't realize there were new cavemen.

Wait, we're not talking about the guy- We- Here's the thing.

Here's the thing.

Yeah.

Cards on the table?

Okay, please put them all down.

Don't keep them close to the chest.

We live in a cave.

You guys live in a cave?

Yeah, in Central Park.

So- In Central Park?

Yeah.

Okay.

Please don't tell anybody.

I- Look, I mean, I'm not- It's a miracle we haven't been discovered in there.

So I didn't realize there were caves in Central Park.

Yeah, there's one.

Wow.

Keep out.

So here's the band.

It's my whole family.

First we have- This is the entirety of your family.

There are no other members.

There is one other member who's not in the band more on that later.

I thought you were calling me a moron.

Sorry.

Continue.

Night is still young.

Right here we got- This is grandma.

Grandma is- The manager.

And grandma of the band.

This is my mother-in-law.

This is your mother-in-law.

Yes, everyone calls her mama.

What?

Mama, I'm introducing you.

What?

She's- She doesn't hear so good.

Okay, yeah.

Obvious.

We're at a sweet touch.

Okay, all right.

I'll put in the order.

She manages all the concessions and stuff like that that we sell at the show.

She manages them, but you put in the orders.

Look, she's- I need a sour.

She's getting on in years, right?

She's not- You know, she's not young anymore.

How old is she?

I can't tell.

She's in the mid-90s.

Oh gosh.

Okay.

She looks pretty good.

She looks- Yeah, well, you know, I mean- We look the same age.

How old people, once you're past a certain age, you all look the same.

You'll see.

So, uh, mama?

How long have you been with the band since the beginning?

Yeah.

He says you've been in the band since the beginning.

Oh, she heard me.

Oh, she makes that noise when she acknowledges something.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

Now, I was married to mama's daughter.

Okay.

And all the kids are my kids with my previous wife.

With your previous wife?

Yes.

Okay.

And is your previous wife with us?

No, she's not here.

No, thank God she is not here.

So, she's the member of the family who is not here?

Yes, exactly.

And this is my other ex-wife.

Oh, you know, I don't like that word.

This- I know my former wife.

Okay.

I'm no ex-wife.

I'm a Z-wife, baby, because I may not have been the first, but I definitely was the Omega.

Oh.

She's- She's something else still.

Yeah.

This is Kim Bega.

Kim Bega.

Yes.

Okay, so you don't have the name- And a Bergen track.

Nate Bergen track.

Yes, indeed.

Formerly Bergen track.

Okay, go ahead.

That's who I was.

But we're still on good terms, so I'm still in the band.

We're still on good terms.

I still have your name on my debit card.

It gets me a lot of places.

She flashes that debit card around.

And doors open.

I'm just saying it helps to have a white-sounded name sometimes.

You know what I'm saying?

Bega, people don't know where you're from.

They don't want to give you a line of credit.

Are you- what is your background?

What is your- Oh, arts and fine dining, baby.

Okay, that doesn't give me any clue.

She's very cosmopolitan.

She's a citizen of the world.

It's right.

I've lived in Panama City and Panama City, Florida.

Okay, interesting.

That tells me a lot.

Who else do we have with the family here?

Over here is Trey.

Trey.

Trey's the oldest boy.

Hey.

Trey, you say hey, which rhymes with your name?

It does.

Trey is 48 years old.

I'm 48.

The eldest boy.

I'm the oldest boy.

So you had Trey when you were 15, 17, somewhere in there?

I'm in my mid-60s.

Right.

Trey is 48 years old.

So you do the math.

Yeah, so I did.

Yeah.

And then you asked me to do it again.

Yeah, Gishel delivered me too.

Really?

That's right.

Yeah, that's right.

We were- we were at a Yankees double-letter.

Was it in between the two games?

Or oh my gosh.

So he caught the second- My son, Trey caught the second game.

Yeah.

I was born right in a third base.

Did Gishel bring his glove so he could kind of- He did.

He caught me.

He caught me and then they wrapped me in the glove in a rubber band to sort of break the glove in.

Yeah.

Yeah, the oils- I was oily.

Of the placenta.

Really best thing for a ball glove.

Yeah, I lived in that glove underneath the bed for about six- For six months.

Yeah.

Breaking that glove in.

Yeah.

How's- Eric has passed down.

How's that glove now?

It's fully broken in and I care what- Strongest, but- As you can see, it's- It's grafted into my back.

See, he's like a turtle.

Oh my god.

Oh, yeah.

I did not realize that when you walked in, but you have a full-on just catcher's mid.

Yeah.

Grafted to your back.

My goodness.

Yeah.

And I'm a guitarist.

Trey plays the guitar.

All right, let's hear a little bit of what you have.

Okay.

Oh.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Deloises by Kim Baga.

Yeah, we like to harmonize on guitar.

How many people do that?

You know Kim Baga's brother is Lou Baga.

I didn't want to- I didn't want to break it up.

But yeah, sister.

That's a big thing.

We- I can't believe we haven't brought it up yet.

We have not exploited that for our own purposes by- And mombo number five is about Tim.

I'm inside.

What?

About Tim.

Tim Kim's brother.

Tim Baga.

Lou Baga wrote a song about his own brother, Tim Baga.

And who do you leave out?

Me?

What am I, the Latoya?

Not anymore, baby.

I thought for sure there was going to be a corn.

There was, but things aren't always what they seem.

Oh boy, that's the truth.

Boy, that's a lot like that movie.

Now you see me too.

Oh, about magic.

Well, Woody Arrow to place twins.

Oh, you've seen it too.

It's my favorite movie.

Wow.

Who else do we have here?

Over here we have the twins, Mac and Jack.

Mac and Jack.

Wow.

Oh wait, so you say twins?

Like that old commercial?

And I say hello.

They're 42 years old.

42.

So you have them when you were in your early 20s.

That's right.

You did the map.

Mac and Jack, what?

You're short from Mackenzie and Jekenzie.

Hi.

Be careful, you get the Mac and Jack attack.

They are identical twins of different sexes.

Yeah, that, okay.

Wait, yes, they are always in the nude.

You do the science.

Wait, so you're identical, but you're different.

So yeah, I mean, you look exactly the same, but you have boobs and you have an erect penis.

Well, it's very warm in here.

Jack, should we explain it to him?

Yeah, it's like the opposite of shrink.

All these strangers.

What's shrink?

Let's get to the other kids.

Okay.

Over here, we got the middle boy, I guess.

Disappointment.

Dartanian.

Don't call him, disappoint.

You stopped that.

Disappointment.

No, he's not.

Disappointment.

Disappoint.

Jinx, we said at the same time.

No, you didn't actually.

He actually did not say it at the same time.

He's just so far apart from each other.

Jinx, Jinx.

Jinx.

I'm going to feed you a code.

Okay.

Okay, guys.

I'm not the right thing.

I'm not a disappointment right then.

You're not a disappointment, Dartanian.

You're a good boy.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Dartanian is the MJ.

He's the Michael Jackson in the family.

Oh, really?

You're the most talented one?

Absolutely.

The best singer.

I'm the smallest.

He's the smallest.

Oh, I see.

That's a weird way to...

He's also at the most plastic surgery.

Yeah.

I didn't have my face.

I did my face so I don't know what I want to look like.

What ethnicity are you now?

Because you're not the same color as any of these people.

My eyes are from...

It's hard for him to talk about.

He's from Thailand, my eyes.

But then my lips...

I try to get my lips similar to the ladies in Florida.

So he's got tie eyes in Florida lips.

Florida lips.

Oh, that sounds like a great song.

Hey, that's not bad.

Let's hear a little bit of it.

Tie eyes in Florida lips.

I got tie eyes...

And Florida lips.

Florida lips.

Ties and Florida lips.

My lips are from Florida.

Gashil.

Wait, did you show me?

Shiloh, I just...

Shiloh, I'm talking...

Dr. Gashil.

And we both have stamps in our passport.

Oh, beautiful.

Oh, that was...

That's...

Part of that was very beautiful.

Hey, thank you so much.

I would say mainly...

What's that open?

Oh, yeah.

The twins are still humming.

What does grandma have?

Baba?

Sweetheart!

Sweetheart?

Sweetheart's raw sale in the lobby.

And...

Now it's perfect.

Perfect.

So you're just doing reviews during the song.

That's right.

Most of us liked it out here in the audience.

Trade does that to prop the audience to clap.

So, Trey, you're in charge of shoutouts and reviews of the song.

I sit in the audience of all the shows.

And I do.

You sit in the audience.

With the guitar, yeah.

And I...

And I go, this sounds honestly pretty good to me.

And you know, I gotta get people going.

It works like a charm.

People don't even...

They don't even think like, well, he's part of it.

Yeah, I usually come in towards the back and I go, who is this?

They're pretty good.

Does anyone shush you while you're...

Yeah, they try to keep me quiet.

I say, don't give me quiet.

I thought when I hear good music, I respond viscerally.

And people have to give it up.

He also...

He buys all the merchandise too.

It helps out a lot.

Yeah, I buy all of our merch up.

You buy the merch.

All of it.

We have merch and I quickly buy it all.

He snatches it off the show.

What do you do with it once you bought it?

I say, I got it all.

Sorry guys, you have to come to the next show if you want to get a sweatshirt.

That is less effective.

But I think we're gonna keep it...

Well, with the results you're not in yet.

So far it hasn't resulted in a lot of...

Revved messages, but...

Well, yeah, good.

My nose is from Budapest.

We still have...

Oh, that's not part of the song.

So we got one more...

Well, yeah, we just made them make up the song.

Okay, okay.

We still have one more child.

One more child.

This is the baby.

Hi.

I've been waiting here.

Very calm.

You've been very patient soon.

Well, who is this?

Who is this little cute little guy?

This is Gobo.

Little Gobo.

Gobo.

Little Gobo.

What are the keys?

Gobo's playing the keyboards like a cute little guy.

Oh, thank you.

He's adorable, isn't he?

How old is Gobo?

He's 34 years old.

34?

He's the baby.

I'm a baby of the group.

It's a pleasure to be here.

Thanks for having us.

Would you like to do one here song?

Sure.

I mean, a song with everyone or just you doing a song?

Just me.

Oh, Gobo.

He's a little charmer, isn't he?

I'm waiting for your patience.

Gobo, play, play your...

Gobo's trying to go solo.

Gobo, go, go, go, go, go, go.

He's one of his albums.

Gobo, go, go, go, go.

Gobo is his album.

Gobo, go, go, go, go.

I just, honestly...

Gobo, go, go, solo.

Now is probably a good time to tell you guys.

I just think you're dead weight.

So, hey, whoa.

Go, go, go.

I agree.

We all agree, Gobo.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Hold on a second.

No, it's not right.

We go to concerts and then I start to play.

And then...

Train goes into the audience.

Yeah, I've been helping out.

Yeah.

I'm helping out with it.

Mama, I don't think is even alive.

Gobo.

She's like half-parrot.

Gobo, this is very...

Do you hear that she acknowledged what she said and she's not happy?

No, she's a fucking parent.

Gobo, go, go, go.

Is that any way for a young man to speak?

Yeah, you're a little take.

I feel like this would go solo.

Do his own thing.

Yeah, thank you.

You just want Gobo, go solo?

Oh, Jack.

We just got finished introducing everybody already.

We're breaking apart.

Now listen, before the family completely breaks apart and they're always on the verge, this is what it's like to be in a family band for several decades.

Right, so you've been around for a while.

We've been around for a while.

And this is the family familial bands, the Birken tract family familial band.

That's right.

Is that because you're a family or do you just play four families?

Both.

For me, extended families only.

We just play for families.

I'm no longer a part of this family, but still on good terms.

So you only sell tickets to people who can prove they're a family?

Yes.

With that hard time fighting success.

Yeah.

Right.

Or be wild.

Be wild, be wild, bring your own blood.

Yeah, right.

And it's a blood test.

That has caused a lot of confusion.

Yeah, Maury's there.

Maury is there.

Maury Povich is at all of our shows.

So if you are the father, admit it, you get to go in.

Admit it, Maury Driggs, and Maury.

And it mittens.

Admittance.

That's a direct quote.

Maury is drunk all the time.

Right.

So that must be cutting down on your ticket sales, because I don't think I would want to go through that rigmarole to...

And well, well, I mean, if you don't want to see a good show, you don't want to see a good show.

Well, let me, as much as I like my family, I don't know that I would want to...

Whoa, who was that?

That was me.

That was you.

Oh, God, are you okay?

Probably not.

Dad, you can't die.

Go, Bob, go solo.

Go, Bob, what have I told you?

I'll never die.

Yeah, that's right.

Now listen, what we'd like to do is, because this is our last shot, you know, being on your show, this is the biggest exposure we've ever gotten.

Okay, so you've been around for a while, you haven't had any success, and you are viewing this appearance.

Wow, we've had modest success.

Well, what does that mean?

I mean, it sounds like you're selling your own merch to your sells.

We played every riverboat casino in the nation.

Every single one.

Every one that's on trailers.

Yeah, okay.

They'll dry land it.

Riverboat casinos that are out of commission.

Yeah.

And they're in, they're up on block, on blocks.

We played all that.

Have you been paid for these appearances?

Yeah.

We broke even for most of them.

Yeah.

We broke even, because you know, they, you know, you have to pay for your own meals, and we're a big family.

So of course, that costs a lot of money.

Sure.

And they never have casserole.

It's true.

Isn't that weird?

It's very strange.

They never have casserole.

It's very strange.

What's the deal with that?

I swear to God, no place in red casserole.

It's, it's nice.

It's like casserole.

Oh, my God.

What's better?

Yes.

Casserole.

Yes.

Mama, Mama, Mama.

Remember the casserole you used to make?

Hot dish.

I called her a dish.

She's frozen in wet.

It's hot.

Hot dish.

I'mma call it that.

And the rest of you, she's from, because she's from Minnesota.

Yeah, but it seems like if she was constantly calling it that, while you were all girl, you would also.

Yeah, it had breast milk in it.

Yeah, there's a nice thick layer of breast milk.

Oh, that's why you know that's the secret ingredient.

It has breast milk.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Mama, Mama, would you like to sing hot dish?

I guess.

Yeah, is this, is this one that the whole band does?

Yeah, it's all of it.

This is the whole diner.

The whole family sings hot dish, including Mama.

This is always a big moment when we bring her out onto the stage.

Traitor, we're out together.

Trae, before the song starter, are you in the audience shouting what chord it is?

Yes, I always get this band on the same page.

And we never change chords in the songs.

And also, but we do not have one surprise chord.

We do have, what is it?

F major seven, but no one knows when it comes.

I don't know that one.

That's true.

All right.

Yeah, so this is called Hot Dish.

Get ready audience, because it's going to be so good.

Turn your eyes to the stage.

At this point, if I were in the audience, I would suspect that you were part of the show.

Well, nobody has any clue, because I'm disguised.

What are you disguised as?

An audience member.

Batman.

He's wearing a Batman costume.

Batman costume.

Okay, we can't fool this guy, so nobody's getting anywhere.

A full Val Kilmer Batman costume.

I still were I in the audience.

I would say, oh Batman must be in the band.

I don't think the disguise is.

But nobody else on stage is dressed like a superhero.

Yeah, I would make no say.

So he looks like an independent operator.

So like a vigilante in the audience.

Exactly.

He's shouting out chords.

Oh, people don't think it's the real Batman.

Yeah, okay, but if any crime breaks out, I cannot help.

They think it's just an audience member dressed like Batman.

Have crimes broken out?

Many times.

It's a heavy, there's mostly crimes in the audience.

You know what's weird?

There's a lot of blackmail that happens to us.

Oh my God.

People blackmailing each other during the show?

Very, as a performer, it's very distracting to see people blackmailing each other in the show.

So they're passing back and forth notes that are cut out of newspapers?

A lot of people.

That's red skin napping, such ransoms.

Yeah, a lot of people scream.

Sometimes it's blackmail too.

I mean, let's be honest.

They're not, but they can see each other.

So mostly they're just whispering, I'm going to reveal that information about you.

If you don't give me $10,000.

Got it.

I hate this interrupt, but this is the longest intro to hot dish that we've ever played.

So far, it's perfectly on the script.

The baby's being a baby.

Oh, I'm being, I'm the only one who that people come out for.

Oh, poor go, boss.

Oh, shut up, dad.

Oh, poor go.

Is this part of the song?

This is all by the song.

Yeah, this is all on script.

The song is so far perfectly rehearsed.

Perfectly rehearsed.

So the twins kick it off.

We're twins.

Yes, we are.

We want to hot day.

We are hungry.

I want to hot day.

Huh?

Gessaro.

She's switched now.

Get out of the song.

What?

Where's in the middle of the song?

Why?

Let's see that hot dish.

Time to eat that hot dish.

My neck is from Japan.

Hot dish, gessaro.

Really waiting for that F major 7.

Do you know the power of a casserole?

When you see a dish so hot?

Do you know the power of a casserole?

A hot dish is what you got.

I want to go to.

Okay, okay.

Godly, that was so good.

I want that on a CD.

Too bad they're all gone.

Come back next time.

And that's hot dish.

Oh, good stuff.

Good stuff.

Is it any wonder I'm crazy about them?

It's fun.

It's fun to be around them.

It's fun to be around you.

It's just fun to listen to the show.

Speaking of listening to the show, though, we have to take a break where you can stop listening to the show if you want.

But you are now released from your duty.

You may stop, but we do have another episode coming right around the corner.

And this is a...

Where a fudge is made?

That's true.

And we're giving out fudge in the next segment.

This is a very popular episode.

And one I was listening to earlier today, it's very funny.

So you're not going to want to stop listening before that episode.

Not coming up after the break.

We'll have more of your countdown.

This is Comedy Bang Bang.

Comedy Bang Bang, we are back.

This is...

We are back.

And this is the first episode of The Best ofs.

And we're counting them down.

We've heard episode 16, 15, and 14.

And let us terry no further.

Let us get to your episode 13.

Indeed.

Number one, three.

All right, episode 13.

Now we've had one from March 6th, one from February 6th.

Then we jumped ahead to May 29th.

Now we're going back to February 27th.

This is episode 473.

Now what's interesting about all of these episodes we've talked about today, they've all been from pre-episode 500, which is sort of where the demarcation point, there's pre...

There's pre-fontaine.

Pre-fontaine.

And there's post-fontaine.

That's what the other movie about pre-fontaine should have been called, right?

That's exactly.

Post-fontaine.

Him in heaven.

He can run as much as he wants.

But angels fly faster.

And they're always like, aha.

So true.

Wow, it sounds like hell.

It might be hell.

This is an episode called, Tight Tort.

Tight Tort.

Now let's talk about the participants of this episode.

We have now our good friend, Ben Schwartz.

Sure.

Great friend of the show.

You know him as the original voice of BB8.

And then Bill Hader got involved.

And then they just were like, let's just put bleeps and bloops in this thing.

Yeah, what is that?

I don't understand.

So did they...

Did BB8 say words?

And then they changed it?

Yeah, I think it was like, hey, just improv and maybe we'll cut out the words and just use the inflections or something like that.

And what?

I don't understand why there's two people.

I don't know.

Bill got involved and maybe he was making...

Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

Wild Ben was doing it.

I haven't gotten the full story.

I don't know what it was, but I do know that they tossed it all out.

And now none of them are involved in this new Star Wars.

But you also know him from his hit show.

Oh, that's being generous.

House of Lies.

And we have...

Be generous that it's a hit or that they would know him from it.

Either way, I'll tell it take all comers.

He has a movie coming out with Billy Crystal coming up soon in 2018, I believe, where Billy Crystal plays his father.

And...

Is it called, JU the movie?

Hey, come on.

That's not the type of humor that we do on this show.

It's not the type of humor you're known for.

It's really...

I feel like you were just showing off.

It's really not.

I was trying to act cool.

Come on, you don't need to do that.

People like you for who you are.

I'm sorry, everybody.

So Ben was on this show, and the other person on the show is Thomas Middleditch, whom people know from as Paul of Tomkins' arch enemy.

That's right.

My old rival.

People know him from Silicon Valley and from these Verizon commercials that seemingly play every hour of every day.

That's right.

When I was watching baseball this year on the at that Major League Baseball app, a lot of times they'll just run one commercial over and over and over again.

And you'll just see the same one, just one, many times he's appeared on our countdown.

He was in the top spot last year for Kid Detectives, too.

Not your Rupp Saltman wound.

And he and Ben, a lot of people don't know this, but they improvise together in shows here in Los Angeles together.

I think it's called Middleditch in Schwartz, maybe.

I can't recall.

I think so.

But they do these shows together and they're very funny together.

And I believe Ben said to me, hey, what if we're doing a show coming up at Largo?

Maybe we could do an episode the next day together because they had never done the show together.

Now Ben, primarily when he's on the show, he does it just as himself and he's just himself and doesn't do character work.

That's right.

This is the only episode in which he has ever portrayed a character on the show.

And this is called...

And a character, I'm assuming, wildly different from his personality.

I mean, he's got the qualities of his personality.

If you were listening to this, you would say, who is this?

I mean, it is a little different, honestly.

It's...

I know you're making a joke, but...

I'm about to.

Oh!

I did not remember this episode all that well.

So I did a refresher course this morning and Coolop came in and was like, who is this?

And didn't know who either of them were.

And I told her, and we were laughing herself silly as I hope that you guys will, when you hear this.

That's fun.

This is Ben Schwartz as Marcus Quittlebit and Thomas Middleditch as Alan Buchanan.

This is your episode 13, tight tort.

Number one, three.

Let's introduce you.

He is an entrepreneur of a small business.

I'm guessing please welcome Alan Buchanan.

Hello, Alan.

Hi.

Thank you so much for having me on here.

It's been a while since I've interacted really with anyone.

So this is nice.

Yes.

Really?

So you're a bit of an introvert or...

Not my choice.

Are you perhaps even a goraphobic?

Not bad choice.

No, I don't think anyone would choose either of those things.

I'm not a goraphobic.

I do like going out.

I go outside with my dog muffins.

And we stroll along the park.

Okay.

Does your dog stroll as well or is your dog just kind of...

Oh, I think that is funny.

But no, it gallops.

You do think it's funny though?

I can appreciate it.

The reviews are in.

I love this.

I love that.

I enjoy this.

I love it when a guest comes on and tells me they think I'm funny.

That's very, very nice.

Thank you so much.

What do you have there?

What's in your hand?

Well, I do have a couple of jars of my jams and jellies and preserves.

Oh, and these are things you bought or...

Those are things I've been making.

It's been a while since I've had any formal level of employment.

I used to be a data entry specialist.

Wait, so you specialize in that?

I'm not...

I trained other people to data, to enter data.

What is there to know other than here's some data, put it in there?

Spreadsheets.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, so it sounds like there's a little bit of control X, control C, control V.

You'd think paste would be control P, but it's not.

It's control V.

Yeah, well, probably because it's right there, you know.

Definitely because it's right there, but it is counterintuitive.

It really is.

Yeah, well, I mean, the whole QWERTY keyboard system is kind of...

I don't know what you're talking about.

Wait, you don't know what QWERTY is?

Excuse me, sir.

You can call me Scott on the host.

I'm controlling the conversation, not you.

I just think that you should know and the listeners at home should know...

Yeah.

That I suffer from...

Who just came in here?

What is this?

It's me.

What a loud room outside of the tree.

A quality.

Excuse me, who are you, sir?

Me?

Yeah.

My name is Marcus Quittlebit.

You're what?

Marcus Quittlebit.

Marcus Quittlebit?

Yes.

Okay.

And who are you?

Why did you just come in here?

It's insane.

You must not have read the articles on TV.

There was an article on TV?

Many articles of me have been on a three to different TV shows and networks.

I'm famous for trying to become a superhero by being bitten by either a spider or roving in toxic waste.

Maybe you've seen my pictures.

I...

You know what?

This is ringing a bell.

I saw...

I think I've seen a few of you.

Do you see?

Oh, what is that?

What is that in your head?

We got some jums and some jums?

This is a raspberry jam.

Is this part of your business, by the way, you make?

Currently, this is my business because I have not been able to acquire employment elsewhere.

Right.

So you may be about to say, I suffer from WCS.

What is WCS?

That is wet crotch syndrome.

Oh.

It's not urine.

It is hyperhidrosis of the crotch.

Meaning your crotch gets very wet from perspiration?

Yes.

There are no sweat glands down there.

The sweat glands are in my armpits, but due to some severe burns I received as a child, my armpits are sealed over.

And so the excess sweat drains down my body and out of my crotch.

Anywhere from the top, the base of my penis.

Wow.

All the way back down to the start of my anus.

What do you consider to be the base of your penis, by the way?

Is that the top part?

The bottom of the balls or is it the top part?

The top part of the shaft.

The top part of the shaft of the penis where it meets the rest of the abdomen.

This is amazing because for me, I actually one time tried to become a superhero by putting my dick inside of wax and lighting it on fire.

Oh, okay.

I don't know how that would work.

It is a superhero.

There'd be nobody can ever affect my penis.

So for me...

I guess there's a lot of crazy things that happen to superheroes.

Like the flash.

Are you a superhero?

Did it affect your penis?

Yes.

In a way, yes.

Which way?

In a way, no.

In a way, yes you are a superhero or in a way.

It affects your penis.

Well, this is a two-step question and I'm going to hit you up with a two-step answer.

First answer for the...

What's the first question?

How old am I?

No.

Yeah, I would like to know that because you have a sort of a child-like lisp.

Let's say I'm three, I don't think I am.

And I'll say it at the same time.

We go one, two, three, nine-eight-four.

Wait, you're ninety-four?

Nine-eight-four years?

I can never tell at the age of a child.

I find them absolutely missed.

You hate children?

No, I just can't tell their age.

Okay, but you are ninety-four years old.

Ninety-four years young.

I've been doing it before Stanley with Stanley.

But your proportions are small like a child.

Yes, I'm small because I forgot to keep growing.

Do you suffer from that comical disease Benjamin Button syndrome?

Yes.

So the older I get, the younger I am, in a week I'm going to be a little sperm.

One week, you're going to be...

Yeah, it really gets faster at the end there.

I can't wait.

Do you mind coming back in a week?

I can't wait to be king.

I would love to.

I'm sorry.

Wait a minute, I'm sorry.

Scott, what?

How do you know me?

I never introduced myself to you.

I think I find that humorous.

Thank you so much.

Wait, I'm going to say a joke.

Can you tell me if it's funny or not?

You can laugh and you can try to funny.

Just so you know, I've been the butt of many jokes.

And I think it's done something to my humor receptors, if that is a thing.

It just wears you down.

I'm going to try to make you laugh for real.

This is sort of like an episode of Make Me Laugh.

I like it.

Yeah, it's just one of three.

I want to say if you really get the super thing.

Six seconds on the clock.

You get five dollars for every second you don't laugh.

Oh, well, I'll do my thing.

Yeah, look at me in the eye.

I do it and you check.

Oh, already you check.

Yeah, you're already.

Check, like.

It's very exciting.

OK, that's exciting.

That's not funny.

Ready.

OK, I'm going to get the clock going.

You got to look in the eye, but I'm just going to say some jokes and you got to not laugh.

You just have to say that's humorous.

OK, ready we have.

Tell me where to start.

Six seconds on the clock.

Jonathan, Jonathan, tell me when to start Jonathan.

Here we go.

And time.

Start.

Two bongers blocking a bar.

One bonger with a big bonger.

Look at him.

Look at me in the eye.

One bonger.

You already left.

Five seconds.

Thank you.

That is $25.

You want to play one more time?

Oh, well, yes.

OK.

This has been absolutely thrilling.

All right, do you want to bet your vote?

No, it's not that you're excited that you're doing it.

Could you laugh?

I think it has been because I have been excited.

Now, you can keep the $25 or you can go again.

And if you laugh before the 60 seconds, you don't get any money.

But if you go above your five seconds, then you'll win more than $25.

Or do you want to keep your $25?

Need the $25.

The jam's have not been selling.

Eric, I do want to talk about that.

Sure.

Well, I don't know.

We'll go to a talking.

How much talking can you do by jam?

Well, there is like a lot.

It's between a jam and a jam.

OK.

And that's a fair.

Men to be a rhetorical question.

Anyway, do you want to risk it all?

Yes.

OK.

All you have to do is not laugh.

Not laugh.

Already you laugh.

Get it all out.

Is this exciting to?

Get me a second.

So we want to do it.

That is terrificly exciting.

All right.

We don't know.

What's about to say?

You had to knock at that good meeting.

You did not laugh.

And you get $100 for every second, only if you last the entire 60 seconds.

You had to say right in the eye.

By the way, you know that I one time tried to inject my eyes with a serum that would give me super eye strength.

Mm.

All right.

Here we go.

Ready?

All right.

Here we go.

No, you got to put the cup down.

Put the cup down.

All right.

Ready?

All right.

Here we go.

60 seconds on the clock.

Look at me.

I can't.

Help me when you're ready.

All right.

I'm ready to give a joke.

OK.

Go.

Two caterpillars walk into a bar.

One's like, oh boy, I have a caterpillar.

The other one's like, I'm down a trip.

You're fired.

That's no problem.

Well, you still have.

Look, you can.

I could you have a go?

45 seconds left.

OK.

Now in hindsight, all these previous things seem less funny.

What?

Oh, what was I doing?

What?

Laughing and giggling to that type of stuff.

I don't understand it.

Well, what is it?

Maybe it is funny, and I don't get it.

That happens all the time.

Well, this doesn't get a little bit of a...

You have 30 seconds.

41 minutes left.

I'm sure it was hilarious.

I'm so sorry.

If we could talk about the jams.

Could you let Tear him?

20 more seconds.

Hear him talk about the jams.

You have 20 more seconds to try to make him laugh.

Otherwise, he's got a bankrupt.

OK.

Listen, how funny would it be if it was hockey, but instead of hockey, everybody was on pieces of bread and they were making them into butter.

8.

You make bread into butter.

Oh, no.

I'm going to lose it all.

You can't make bread into butter.

20, 22.

Oh, no.

Are you bankrupt?

$100 every goddamn second.

I made $36,000.

Oh, god.

Mr. Ocherman, I said thank you so much.

No.

Honestly, I have had terrible...

Sorry, it's $6,000.

I have had either...

That's even better.

That's better than $36,000.

$36,000?

Oh, $6,000 is what you made.

Oh, well, either way, that's a tremendous boon to my bank account.

This has bankrupted me.

I've had a terrible year.

My daughter passed away drowned in a river.

Oh, no.

My mother passed away old age.

That's not crazy, but just...

But what?

Did they find her in a river as well?

No, in a bed.

But the bed was in a river.

The river bed?

Yes.

I tried to save that bed.

I went in there to try to save it.

Look.

I doubt that.

When I ask...

I would recognize...

Can I say, why do nobody remember me?

Can I say, when I ask you, is it in a river?

You can't say, no, it was in a bed.

And then we find out it was a river bed.

That is cheating.

Look.

Well, I was fired from my job years ago, but...

Okay, so that doesn't count for this year.

Yes, but this year has been tough.

I've been rejected from many positions.

And of course, I'm still no cure for my WCS.

Right.

That's terrible, right.

By the way, I am looking down there.

Yes, if you're chair.

Yeah, that is...

How do you stop really?

Is there any way you can control it?

I can wear adult diapers, and I do from time to time.

But they are terribly unguffed.

Are you wearing one now?

No.

But you can wear pants over them.

Yeah.

By the way, did you?

I'm not sure if you knew that.

Over diapers?

Over the adult diapers.

Yeah, so it's not like...

They don't look good.

They look like you're a...

They're a pan with diapers.

They slightly bunch your pants.

Do you wear very tight skinny jeans?

Well, I wear normal fitting khaki pants with hammer loops on the side of the leg.

Wow, carpenter pants.

They're specifically khakis with hammer loops.

Do you know what I could do?

Only a few companies that make them.

I could make you a superhero outfit.

How's those companies, by the way?

Do you mind?

Oh, shoals.

Two more flea tikies.

One more.

And, uh, ooh, what was it?

Oh, American Appeara.

Ooh, wow.

They really do buy these pants.

I love them.

Okay.

So look.

Nice wide leg boot cut hammer loop cargo pants.

Right, a nice one.

By the way, this is more sweat than should be coming out of your armpits.

Yeah, they're very...

It's very chilly in the studio.

I know what...

I know.

You can't just say it's being rerouted from your armpits at this point.

But that's the character's theory.

Now, there are 11 other people from what I'm told in the world with this syndrome.

So it's really...

Can I ask you a question?

Because this is really what I'm thinking about.

I think you just can't stop pissing your pants and you call it something else.

No, no, no, no. Don't say no, no, Keduka, you right now.

You're pissing right now.

This doesn't look like sweat. It has a yellow urine. It is not urine. It is sweat. Do you mind tasting it and proving it? If it's sweat, then taste in front of it. Why would I taste my own sweat that's disgusting? Let me do it. Because it's better than urine.

Do you want to taste my...

Maybe this is what it'll take. Maybe I'll become Captain urine or something like this. Yes, yes, Marcus. This is it.

This could be my chance to become a real star.

Super Bureau. Do you say Super Bureau? Why? This is not how it's going to happen. Give me it. Sir. I admire your enthusiasm.

Oh my God, he's reaching over and he's grabbing him and...

I can't believe it. This has never happened before. What is it?

Oh my God. Oh my God. Do you feel it? Oh my God. With piss.

It was piss. How do you know what piss tastes like?

That's a good dick sweat. It's either dick, dick, dick, better piss.

No, that's what we were trying to determine. I need to know this bit by knowing that...

...Penile sweat. It's crotch sweat. It's double UCS. Quit trying to make me mad.

Wait. You seem like you're getting slightly angry. You're accusing me of being a urinator and I'm not.

You've never urinated. Of course I have. How do you urinate?

Is it different? Do they come out of a different spurt?

No, it comes out of my urethra. What is so wrong? And what is the threat come out of?

My crotch from the top, from the base, top part of my penis, where the shaft meets my abdomen.

All the way around. Were the shafts the men? The abdomen?

Does the shaft not meet the abdomen?

How was the meeting, by the way? Was it a good meeting?

What? When the shafts met the abdomen?

I am assuming that's funny, but I don't think you're going to assume that. It wasn't that funny.

Your reaction was correct. I had an intimate encounter with a woman about two years ago.

Wow. Details. Give us the dates on the beach.

This was three years after my wife left me. Sure. Your wife died.

No. My mother died and my daughter died. Your wife is not dead. My wife is now dead.

When she asked where she was found? Was it in a river? No.

Where? He was on a boat.

Floating in a river? That's in a river. It's not in a river.

It's on a boat. Sir, you need your fax check. You need an accuracy check right now.

Anyway, I was with a... Benie, Benie, Benie Games. I was with another woman, a different woman, that I met at a candle store. Oh, really?

And we were intimate after about four or five days. Did you get any of the candles involved in this? Well, she did have some nice scented candles at home. Some candles that she made, but she was actually... Wait, she makes candles and she went to a candle store? She was at the candle store to buy supplies to make candles.

They don't... Why would they sell candle making supplies at a candle store? That's going to put them right out of business. It was one of those candle stores that had candle makes. That's like selling milk and sugar at an ice cream store. Ooh, that's a smart idea. Well, you go to an art store, you can buy a maid or you can buy the supplies to me.

Well, yeah, but you go to a museum.

Why are we fighting? They're not going to give you a bunch of watercolors. You take it up with candles, candles everywhere. The candles, candles everywhere? So, what's the name of your website where I can get jammed and jelly? I don't have the website.

But what is the name of your actual company? But it is Buchanan's Jam's. Buchanan's Jam's.

Buchanan's Jam's. Well, it's actually Buchanan's Jam's and then brackets or parentheses, jellies and preserves. Okay, very specific. What's the difference between jelly and jam and a pitherve? Oh, so now you would like to know. Well, I'm curious.

I don't know that we have time before the break, but you don't. I don't. Please. Okay, all right.

I'll allow this one. Start at the beginning of the break.

Tell you. Talk through the whole commercial. If you can get through it in 60 seconds. 60, that's all I get. Yeah, that's all you get.

If you can get through it in 60 seconds, I'll give you a thousand dollars per second or you can keep your six thousand dollars. Did you ever see that Nick Cage movie? Explain it in 60 seconds?

I don't believe I. Now, is that funny? I don't believe it is. Are you sure? Maybe I have no idea.

Nick Cage, Angelina Joel's? Nick Cannon, you said. Nick Cannon and Angelina Joel Eaps.

Do you want to risk your six thousand dollars to see if you can explain the difference? All right, here we go. Ready and go. A preserve is the thicker of the three. That's you're going to get your highest fruit count in there. It's almost as if it were a paste. Now, that's for real fruit lovers.

Now, a jam is somewhere in 45 seconds. I know a jam is somewhere in between a preserve and a jelly.

You've got a little bit of jelly and you've got a little bit of fruit, but a jelly. Now, that is really some gelatinous, shelliton. You're not going to get any fruit chunks. You're just going to get sort of a gelatinous syrupy sweet. You've just talked about the texture. You've really talked about what is the texture? What's the difference? What's the difference?

Yeah, what's my time? You have 15 seconds. Well, there are all what I mean. There's all types of flavors, boys and very black, very raspberry. Is the only difference with thickness and stuff like that? Nice. The consistency. Not the way it's made. Six.

Well, yes, but I can't get in four.

Fits. Those are the differences with the jazz jelly. No, damn it. How much money? Damn it. I won $16,000. Wow. What are you going to do? This is fantastic. I can't tell you. I was about to lose my home. Oh, God. All right. I was default on my mortgages in my home in Arizona. Look at Arizona.

In Arizona. It's biorever. Okay. Look, look. Number one.

Three. Oh, yes. I stand corrected.

Very, very fun. Two funny people. Good episode. That one has been that one really moved up and down the countdown. At some points, it was not in the top 16. At other points, it was even higher than 13. It's really been one that has fluctuated, but at the end of the day, that's where it turned out was episode 13. And that's really what it all comes down to, the end of the day.

That is true. Speaking of the end of the day, we're almost at the end of this show.

Fuck. But this episode in particular, but I did not want Christmas to pass without doing something a little special for the listeners.

You say that as if you don't know what I'm talking about. God, I do know what you're talking about. And I agree, I think the listeners deserve this. They deserve this. Now, last year, I think they had this coming.

Actually, let's talk about two years ago, two years ago, on these best ofs. I don't know what happened or how we stumbled across it. Do you recall the genesis of this?

No, because it's a very twisted path. It was. I can't recall why we were talking about the movie I Robot, but we then implored people not to joke about it.

I don't remember why.

Yeah, I don't remember. I don't remember why it was important not to joke about I Robot.

I don't recall, but then we made a promise to each other that the next year we would sing a song called Please Don't Joke About I Robot This Christmas.

Yeah, specifically it was, don't joke about I Robot at Christmas time.

The rest of the year? Go crazy.

And by the way, is that one day Christmas or is that the Christmas season, which is happening earlier and earlier?

We haven't defined that because there's a lot of people on Twitter who are taking things as jokes about I Robot. And they're saying, I thought, you shouldn't be making jokes about I Robot.

A lot of people are writing to us saying, when's the cutoff?

Yes, exactly. Much like wearing white after Labor Day. When do I have to stop making jokes about I Robot? I'm going to say it's the day after Thanksgiving through Christmas Day.

Through Christmas Day? The end of Christmas Day?

Yes. Not after you've had your Christmas pudding at night, you can joke about it now.

Go on December 26th. Go have at it. So coming up a little later today, you can joke about I Robot.

Yeah. But if you stay awake long enough.

And I hope you do. I pray you do. I pray you do. Last year we sang this song, it became a big hit.

Go listen to it on Spotify, I believe it was released to Spotify.

So this year, we all know not to joke about I Robot. But this year, a little movie came out that captured my attention and caught my eye. And I realized that it's pretty serious too.

And it's something that should not be joked about either.

I think the audience deserves to know that when we were gearing up to do these best ofs, we were scheduling it. You asked me if we were going to do this song.

This particular song, I suggested we do this song.

And I said, well, yeah, if you write lyrics. Yeah, because last year you wrote the entirety of the lyrics of the I Robot song. Eben Schledder, of course, wrote the beautiful music and the backing produced the backing track. This year, you abdicated responsibility of that to me.

And I was glad. I was glad because I took it as a challenge because I love a creative challenge.

And sometimes there's nothing better as an artist than receiving parameters because then there's nothing better. Honestly, there sometimes there is. I remember like, if you were just had to think of anything to do, you'd be like, oh, it could be anything.

But you know, someone comes to me and says, hey, do you want to do a Michael Bolton Valentine's Day special? Then it's like, oh, yeah, I get that. So that's I received these parameters of this is what the song is. And I loved it. I just had fun. It was like a playground. I just like, I had a ball with it. I created all new lyrics.

For this, the tune remains the same. That's right. But I created all new brand new lyrics about a movie that just came out that I hope you've seen. If you haven't seen it, I don't know whether this is going to make sense or not. But we're going to sing it now. And let's not even say what the title is. Okay. Let's just sing the song. What do you say? Yeah.

All right. This is about a current movie currently in theaters. We hope that you don't joke about it. Paul, take it away. Hit it.

You don't have to wrap a gift for me.

And you don't have to put lights on a tree. But I've got one request you must not dismiss.

Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas. Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas.

That's the cruelest thing that you could do.

Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas.

Because I'd turn you would not joke about you. You can sing a carol in the snow.

Gain a bunch of weight and laugh ho ho ho.

You can drink 10,000 mugs of Swiss mists. But please don't joke about itonya this Christmas.

Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas.

That's the cruelest thing that you could do.

Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas. Because I'd turn you would not joke about you.

I'd turn you was released a couple of weeks ago and as of this recording has an 87% score on the rotten tomatoes movie website. That means most of the audience is like to just find. There were way worse movies released this year. Justice League for instance. Maybe make fun of that one.

How about Triple X the return of Xander Cage? No one wanted that. M Night Shyamalan split for crying out loud. Baywatch come on. Baywatch is better than itonya. Get out of town.

So this year as you gather around the Christmas tree to open presents. Just this one time. Don't joke about itonya. Give a man of snow a carrot nose.

Squeeze the baby Jesus's little toes. But should you ignore my warning you'd be remiss.

Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas.

Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas. That's the cruelest thing that you could do.

Please don't joke about itonya this Christmas. Because itonya would not joke about you.

Because itonya would not joke about you.

Merry Christmas. Oh Merry Christmas. Please don't joke about it guys.

Merry Christmas. It's a good movie. Thanks to Eben Schleter for that beautiful music.

Thank you Eben. It's wonderful the gift that keeps on giving. Speaking of the gift that keeps on giving we're going to keep on giving these gifts to you this Thursday part two and then New Year's Day part three and a few days after that part four. We'll see you next time. Thanks. Bye.
