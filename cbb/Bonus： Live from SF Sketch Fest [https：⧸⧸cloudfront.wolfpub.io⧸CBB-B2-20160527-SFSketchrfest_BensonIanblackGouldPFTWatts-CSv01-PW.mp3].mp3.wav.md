♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Yeah!

Reggie Watts, everyone.

Hello, and welcome to the fabulous punchline in the fabulous San Francisco Strip.

Oh!

We're here in front of a fantastic crowd of probably 100 people.

It's so great to see you all.

My name is Scott Ockerman.

Normally, this show is on Indy 1013-1, but this is just a podcast bonus episode.

Thank you all so much for coming out and for you just asking for someone to hand you something at the very top of the show.

I really appreciate that.

Hopefully we'll catch that.

How's everyone doing today?

Thanks for coming out.

Let me explain what is happening.

Okay.

Now, hopefully you've heard Doug Benson's I Love Movies right before this.

What we are doing is a crossover episode.

This is very much like when Lawrence Fishburne will go to Miami and he'll solve a case with Horatio on the several CSI franchises.

But it's also a lot like Live Aid, where basically we just appeared moments ago on Doug Benson's I Love Movies podcast, and now he and I are much like Phil Collins, where we're going to take a transatlantic flight over to my show.

So here we are.

Hopefully you've caught his show, and now it's time for my show.

And thank you so much for coming out.

Now we're having a great time here in San Francisco.

Love it here.

House of Man King.

The only reason to come back.

But a lot's happening in the world.

A lot is going on in the news wire.

We should talk about that a little.

By the way, Reggie Watts, my house band tonight.

Let's hear it for him.

He did the theme song.

How are you, Reggie?

I'm doing quite well.

I'm doing great.

This is good to be up here.

It's great to be here.

You're here all weekend.

Is that correct?

Yeah, I'm right here doing nine more shows tonight.

Now a lot of people know that I like to start the show with news going around in the world.

We talk about news stories.

So hopefully you'll chime in on these.

The major news story that's happening right now is Steve Win, billionaire, came out and talked about exactly why he built a second casino.

I know he had the win casino and then he built the encore casino.

Have you ever been to these?

I haven't been to neither.

I saw one under construction.

That was under construction.

The encore is now completed.

A lot of people are asking him, well, why did you build another casino in such a poor economy?

He finally came out in an interview recently and he explained that he wanted it to be a win-win situation.

That's in the news is what I'm trying to say.

That is hot off the wire is what I'm trying to say.

That's pretty much all that's happening in entertainment news.

Yeah, I think that's it.

There's also something about some rights of something.

Some people owning rights or something.

People owning rights?

Yeah, something.

There's probably something.

I'm just saying it's probably something.

A lot of rights issues.

Yeah, you're right, Reggie.

Reggie, what do you say we bring our guests up because we're running short on time.

We have a packed show today.

Let's bring our first two guests here.

You just heard him on I Love Movies.

I hope Mr. Doug Benson, come on up here.

Doug Benson, come on up here.

I did it.

Doug, how are you, my friend?

I'm good, my friend.

My friend.

You're my friend.

My wife.

I take my shoe off, I'm ready to go through security.

I just take off one.

White take off two.

They get the point.

It's kind of like Cheaper Cobra.

Who is this?

I love it.

I don't know who it is.

I'm going to stop.

Doug, you're going to be here.

I've had enough of this character.

You're going to be here the entire podcast with me.

People just heard you rock the stage.

Yeah, you were here in my entire podcast.

I'm sure it's over here.

I'm not sure if you're a fan of my show, but not Doug's.

Go back and listen to that.

I don't know who that would be.

I don't know who that is.

I think we've got a crowd here that listens to both of our podcasts.

Hopefully.

You're going to be here the entire show, but let's bring out our other guests who will be here.

That's why people listen to our podcast because we have great guests.

Nobody cares about us.

Keep quiet.

They're some amazing guests.

Here we go.

Here's our second guest for the day who will be out here the last night.

I'm going to show you some.

Some people would know I started out as a musical theater actor.

I did many performances of your Joseph Show and your Jesus Show.

Joseph and the amazing tech.

The Chagalajin group.

Yes.

Inspired by scripture.

The story of the coat of very color.

Spilled with a you where I come from.

I'm going to show you some.

Technicolor.

Douglas.

I do believe.

I do believe you're having some fun over there.

I'm having a lot of fun over here.

Oh, I love comedy.

Speaking of comedy though, that brings me to my first question.

What are you doing here at the San Francisco sketch fest?

I will repeat it now.

I love comedy.

I come to the.

I come every year to San Francisco because I enjoy the schedule festival that happens every year.

The scheduled festival.

Schedule.

The schedule festival.

Is that also a story for you?

It is spelled with so many use.

You can't even believe it.

I might as well have a hard time remembering how many.

It's like trying to spell that dashing Hanukkah.

How many K's?

A C and H.

Yes, I love sketch comedy.

I love, and let down to everything I do is so serious and dire as my beloved libbiz.

Or Miss Saigon.

I think that's one of mine.

I'm not quite sure about that.

Is it not?

Oh, I lose track.

I lose track.

When the mules takes over the beer.

I'm not sure if I've written this or that or the other thing.

I loved the other thing.

Thank you.

How many total is that win?

Underrated.

Not a single one.

We will shut out.

We will belly shut out of those blazatodials.

Let us pause for a moment to let Andrew.

Let's see if we can get some more.

I do.

Will you ask?

Let me ask you.

I'm sorry to ask you questions to the exclusion of my other two guests.

Oh, no, no.

You are a fascinating guest.

You are a amazing guest.

I can't believe you got him.

No, it's quite a big deal.

You are a big busy with some boys or something.

What?

I beg your pardon.

I'm married to a bikini model.

Everyone knows it.

She's gorgeous.

I'm a bikini model boy.

This is what I meant.

Wow.

Let me ask you.

Let me ask you a question here.

I saw you on American Idol recently.

You were talking about your show Cats.

Yes.

Which is...

Oh, someone said you need that.

I didn't know who Andrew was.

No, now I get it.

Do you mean Cats?

Oh, he's from Cats?

Do you mean Cats the longest running musical in Broadway?

He's real.

Because that's the Cats I wrote.

Wait, wait, wait.

There were Cats in the chorus line?

Because I think that was the longest running musical.

How dare you?

Cats beat the chorus line.

Finally, that...

Oh, I don't get me started on the chorus line.

But Andrew...

It's just a line of people.

Boring.

Phantom than be Cats.

Phantom.

Oh, Phantom.

Wait, I wrote that.

Yes.

It all worked out.

Everything's fine.

Why is he so much trying to pull the fire along?

Call it off.

Andrew, are you worried about Wicked?

Wicked was going to catch up to you.

I think...

That'll never catch up.

Thank you, Sculpt.

Never.

Now, about Cats, though, what I found interesting is it ran for such a long time because you were trying to make a lot of money back.

Yes.

You know, because what a lot of people don't know about that, and I read an interesting fact in one of my Broadway books, is that it's not only the longest running...

Wasn't your Broadway book?

Oh, he...

He chose it from his Broadway library.

But it was not only one of the longest running musicals, but also one of the most money losingest musicals of all time.

It was voted by the Guinness Book of World Records.

Curated by the McWherson brothers.

It was voted as officially the money losing its show in the history of Broadway.

Now, why do you stress the last syllable of Broadway?

That's how it sounded a bit on the great, white way!

But when you say the great white way, you don't stress the way in that.

No, I...

Well, I'm not able to.

It's not that I'm not trying to.

I can't quite... I can't quite make it happen.

I would love to hear you try at least one more time.

The great white way!

Ah!

So close.

The great white way!

I can do it. I can do it.

Let's hear it, dude.

The great white way!

Yes!

Doug Benson with the wind.

Oh, that puts me in line of young Sam Harris, the first star search winner.

When he sang, over the rainbow.

Now it seems like you're just stressing the last...

Wait, wait, wait.

I told you I do a little rainbow.

Rainbow.

But, uh, what rainbow today?

Oh, I love the poet rainbow.

Mr. Sir Weber.

Yes.

Sir Weber, why did your show lose so much money?

It seems to me like if it ran for that long, you would make a lot of money.

Well, it's very simple, Scott.

Yeah, well, please explain that.

People don't...

People don't realize this outside of the world of the theatre.

But you know what's damned expensive is Whiska Glue.

It costs more than you think, Doug.

It's pricey. It's pricey.

Then it had... it had happened to solve that problem as the show ran on and on and on, to the point where people wished it would stop.

We then started a double-engineetic engineering.

To turn our actors into sort of people cats.

Well, here's what you don't know about genetic engineering, but might be able to figure out if you use a brain for two seconds.

Genetic engineering...

What did I say?

Genetic engineering.

Oh, it's very dear.

It's very dear.

It costs a lot of the old moolah, yes.

So now, uh...

Now, I remember when you were on American Idol, you were talking about the song Memory, and it was sung by a very specific type of cat.

Oh, yes.

She's a wonderful old glamopuss.

It's a type of cat.

Wait, but now hold on a second.

Yes.

What exactly did you say?

Was it a glamopuss?

Was it... was it a gelaco cat?

No!

She was not a gelaco cat.

Her old grizzly-bira.

She was a glamopuss.

Everyone knows what that means.

They'll not need any explanation whatsoever.

There are...

You explained...

I remember you explained it to David Cook, and you just said that she was a glamopuss.

Yes.

And he had to stand there and say, oh, okay.

Like he knew what you were talking about.

But what is it?

Well, if I say to you, uh, the sun rose today, you would have to stand there and know what I was talking about.

Because that's what it is.

I don't know how do you explain something that divides explanation.

It is.

She was a glamopuss.

Look, there are many types of cats in the musical cats.

It's named cats after all.

There's bound to be a few.

What many types of cats?

What other types of cats could you have written a musical about?

Strange.

And they're struts?

They're wild.

They're tendencies to strike.

Top, hip, lasagna eaters, Halloween sexies.

That's the time you get.

I think keyboard.

Keyboard, of course.

Uh, cheeseburger, Ken Hazles.

Sounds like there's a sequel in the works.

Oh, I would love to revisit those.

Dolly go, creatures.

See what they're up to today.

Watch.

Perhaps if you have achieved great things in the cat world.

The equivalent of, uh, government.

A cat government.

I'd love to see you mean cat for men.

Cat for men.

Oh, Scott, do you, do you have a patted to panda?

No, unfortunately.

Oh, we have to both promise to remember cat for men.

Let's make that dear promise to ourselves.

David Shao.

Let's do that.

A dream of the wish you a hot beat.

That's from Paducchio.

Sir, sir, Weber.

Sir, Weber, I hate to cut this off, but I only have time.

We only have time for one question to have a pack show.

I am the giant of the British Empire.

I know, I know.

But we only have time for one more question, which is, are you working on any more new projects?

Yes, of course.

It's been a while since I've seen one of your shows in the theaters.

I would love to see something new.

I was taking some time off to watch television, but I'm ready.

I'm ready to jump right back into the musical theater.

I'm painting a new show about space.

Space.

And the exploration of it.

The final frontier one would say.

Yes, yes, I'm boldly going into that arena.

I don't get it.

What?

What's that now?

Who now?

We don't understand each other.

Yes, it's musical about space.

Tell me a little bit about it.

I would love to hear, can you tease anything?

Well, we are in the various details.

Okay, that's a given.

But there's a very touching ballad about the idea of space exploration.

I will give you a little sample of it right now.

Please do.

It goes like this.

There's a lot of space.

I'm going to show you a little bit about space exploration.

Of course he was.

Mmm.

Star Sailor.

Blah blah blah something.

Spacecraft.

Again, this is just...

Again, it's not even a first draft, not even a first draft.

I have to say it's in the early stages, but that is more like what I'm talking about.

Yes, yes, yes.

Here's what I do.

I sing that into my mobile, then I send the file off to this company and it makes anything you want into a song.

It's really the secret to my success.

I highly recommend it if you'd like to be a millionaire knight to some sort.

Of some sort.

Well, thank you, Mr. Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Thank you, guys.

Thank you.

Stay here.

Thank you.

Hey, L.W.

Say here if you would.

We're going to play a game in a second, but we have a special treat for everyone here.

Is our other guest here.

He's going to do a little stand up for us.

And since this goes finest comics, please welcome Dana Gould.

Yeah!

Doug will be taking your mic.

He was on my podcast.

He was on your podcast.

Oh, hello, Dana Gould.

This is the perfect venue to do stand up.

Standing in front of four very skilled stand ups.

Five, actually.

No, you have to kill me.

So I'll do is...

I'll do it.

Oh, exactly.

So what I'll do is...

I'll do it more like a jury summation where I involve you, the jurors of my set into the set.

The only thing that will be bad for the audience is that they won't see me at all.

This is radio.

People don't need to see you.

Indeed.

Oh, this isn't radio.

This is theater being reported for radio.

The eternal struggle.

Between radio and not radio.

Interesting.

You might not be aware of this, sir, sir, whatever.

Is it, sir, Lloyd Webber or sir, Webber?

Sir Andrew Lloyd W.

Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Really?

You choose to abbreviate the Webber.

Yes.

The last names are not important.

I am afraid of confusion with the cruel people.

That changed because Sir Galahad would have been known more by his first name, Craig.

Craig, get ahead of me.

Hey, this woman makes fancy cakes, so you might have something to discuss later.

Do tell her.

Fancy cakes.

Maybe.

On the radio, the kind, bedroom.

What are... what are Halloween sexies?

By the way...

I don't know what Halloween sex is.

It's a joke because I once dated what you would call a gothling.

A gothlady would qualify as a Halloween sexy or siectia.

Perhaps.

It depends what time of year is it.

Wait, what if it's Halloween?

Have you ever... have you ever...

Have you ever dated a goth chick for four or five months before you realize they were just an orthodox Jew?

Seamlessly weaving my material into our dialogue.

Seamlessly weaving!

Steak that into my phone.

My notebook jots.

It's lovely to be here at San Francisco with such a steeped group.

I was down Market Street today.

Market Street.

What I love about Market Street is that it is for people who don't believe in Darwin, go to Market Street.

Because San Francisco has the most and highestly evolved levels of bums in the country.

And because there are so many of them and their food supplies are limited, it's survival of the fittest.

Remember, it's not the strongest that survive.

It's those most adaptable to change.

In Los Angeles, I go have a bum.

I have a dirty guy with a rotten old beard who lives in a cardboard box.

But in San Francisco, you'll have like a dirty old guy with a rotten old beard that lives in a cardboard box in a wizard's hat.

Like he knows to put that extra cherry on the parfait, if I may coin a phrase.

It is as if, like, you know...

Is that already a phrase or answer?

No, it is a phrase.

I'm cherry on the parfait.

Why is the highestly advanced phrase you can imagine?

What people don't realize, it was actually the first phrase of the Declaration of Independence struck in the copy.

Correct!

To put the cherry on this parfait of a revolution, I have something to tell you.

It was stolen from green sleeves.

But like, you know, dirty caveman in the cardboard box, no money.

Pedophile Gandalf, you give money. That's the point.

The other big thing going on right here is, you know, they're doing that gosh darn gay marriage thing.

What?

I love how Christians feel that people choose to be gay.

And that the reason they choose to be gay is to subvert the established order.

That's why they decide to do it, to get them.

It's all about them.

I just don't feel that any dude kisses another dude unless you really have to kiss a dude.

I don't think a man looks at a vagina and thinks the only thing that could make this better is if poop came out of it.

A classic take.

I'm just here to paint a picture with words.

But here's the thing. They feel that gay sex is an abomination, yet they're against gay marriage.

Ladies and gentlemen, trust me, I've been married for 75,000 years.

Nothing will stamp out gay sex faster than gay marriage.

Here's two words that rarely kick off an athletic boat of lovemaking.

You again!

Here's all I'll say is I wrap up and return.

Here's all I say is I fold the tent on my presentational pretext.

A friend of mine just got married recently.

Thank you for getting back to this house.

She was happy about that.

Same woman that hated up in the air.

She's very excited for your friend.

In a way, marriage is a lot like up. The first five minutes are awesome.

Calling back the previous show.

Then it's just people doing things you can't imagine they could really do.

But all I can say to the fellas in the audience, ladies, take a break.

Guys, listen up, ladies, go on to the...

Guys, listen up, ladies, grab a fresco.

Get some hot pockets and chaste that can't pile the front yard.

The guys are gonna talk.

Unless I'm getting...

I don't know, folks, before I proceed, I just have a quick question for you.

Have I been out there too much, or should I go further out there?

Further out, let's hear it.

You think?

Hope I'm not getting too weird for you.

Hope you guys are ready for me to drop a truth bomb.

You know why I'm angry?

Because of the way the war on terror has changed my America.

You know, when I was a tot, dropping an underwear bomb and shitting your pants and nothing else.

Where's my America?

Why?

What? I thought you were gonna say, good night.

Good night.

I will.

Good night.

Dana Gold, everyone.

Nice one.

There you go.

Thanks, Doug.

All right, so thank you so much, Dana, for that.

Thank you, Dana.

That was a Doug, you're throwing out a comedic flotation device.

Thanks, buddy.

Thanks, man.

I'm here in...

I'm here in February.

Oh, by here he means some of the things that he's doing.

I'm here in February.

Oh, by here he means some club somewhere.

I'm here at the sandwich of the muchland in February.

I believe...

As if I tried...

Dana Gold.

With no one behind me.

Oh, oh.

Dana, thank you so much for going on.

I don't know what that means.

I would chat to you a little bit, but we're running really short on time.

Thank you so much.

All we have time for...

We're gonna play a brief game.

We only have time for one question, and then we're gonna hear one song from Reggie Watts.

Reggie Watts is here?

What the fuck is that?

It's Reggie Watts headlining two shows tonight here at the Pusland.

Yes, yes, yes.

People should stick around by tickets.

Reginald Walts at the punchlin.

What a delight!

Andrew Lloyd Webber is a fan.

You can use that on your posters.

He drops Beats the Cat's Love.

I don't follow that.

It's a 60's turn.

What's that?

All right, so we're gonna play a game.

We're gonna do one question.

It's now time to play Would You Rather?

It sounds like people have heard this show before.

Oh, God, I'm staring.

All the tickets are turning.

Oh, it's still going.

It's not over.

Is it time to play?

And it's time to play.

Oh, okay.

That was everything it's on.

I wish I would have ran out and took a dump during that.

If I didn't know and I had 40 seconds, we were taking advantage of it.

Here's how we play.

I hate to rush through about running out of time.

I'm gonna ask one question, and then I will open the floor for questions.

You can ask me anything about this scenario.

And then I will close the floor to questions, and we will vote.

And then we'll see how the votes come out, and we'll award points.

All right, here we go.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Yes.

Okay, go.

These are all.

These are all suggested by people to my Twitter account at Scott Ockermann.

And we got some good ones today, but I can only read one.

So I'm trying to figure out which is the best one.

Oh, pick a number.

All right, here we go.

This comes from Nick Flanagan.

Nick Flanagan.

Take name.

Would you rather?

Whoa, whoa, are you here?

Nick Flanagan from Canada, actually.

Five hundred and eighty Canada, you assholes.

Would you rather always be on a really slow roller coaster with your dad who gets queasy easily?

Queasyly?

Would you rather always be on a really slow roller coaster with your dad who gets queasy easily?

Or be Bob Dole's eternal scalp masseuse?

All right, I am opening the floor for questions.

I will take any questions about this particular scenario to help you in your vote.

Red, you can jump in on this.

I have a question.

All right, Doug.

What's your problem?

Why would you put me in such turmoil?

Doug, that is anti-house.

That is the hardest choice to make.

That is this tough.

But do you have a specific way?

Sophie's like, that is fucking easy.

I have a question.

I mean, harder.

Doug loves movies.

I have a question.

Okay, Michael Ian Black.

I understand that it's his eternal scalp massage or monsueur.

You understand that good.

Does that mean that Bob Dole himself remains alive?

Or can he die and I'm then massaging his dead scalp?

That is a great question, Michael.

Thank you so much for bringing that up.

I don't want a massage dead scalp.

See, I would rather- I want to be on the record.

I don't want a massage.

Well, there comes a point of decomposition where you're just carrying around a skull doing this and you can kind of live a normal life.

Sure.

Now here, let me- Yes, indeed, normal.

Compared to riding a fucking roller coaster for eternity with your quiesely dad, then yeah.

But that's a fun roller coaster.

I don't want to say my point of view too early in this game, but roller coasters are fun.

I have to answer to Michael Ian Black's question.

I do a question withdrawal.

Thank you.

Michael, that's very easy to answer.

When it says eternal, the universe is still random, anything can happen.

So you may die first, he may die first, but whoever dies first, the other person must continue their job doing what they're doing.

Well, Bob Dole doesn't have a job in this scenario.

If you really think about it- Yeah, his job is clutches his tens.

His job is clutching a pen.

Thank you, Doug.

He gets his- Sorry.

He gets his- He gets his head massaged, so if you die first, then his job is to take your hands and work them into his scalp.

And if he dies first, then you have to massage his scalp.

But when it says eternal, what it means is that basically, the time spent on this earth is insignificant, really, when you think about the time that we spend in heaven.

Fuck you.

I like roller coasters.

Does Missy and Black's expression of the fuck you mean his question is pronounced?

Yes, I asked Mr. Weber- I have a question.

Yes, Mr. Weber.

For the win.

This- This queasy dad.

I understand his easily queased, but- He's a queasy- Hey, I asked this.

May I ask this?

Is he a stoic sort of chap?

Is he one who's able to mask his emotions?

Keep calm and carry on.

That is- Stiff-up-r-lipping-all that.

Stiff-up-r-lipping-all that.

Can I ask the person- S-U-L, S-U-L.

Go on- I know that it is not my job to ask questions, and this may be, in fact, unprecedented.

This is unprecedented.

Oh, you said it was.

Oh, yes.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I thought you were just repeating what I was doing.

No, I arrived at the thought in the second two weeks.

That's how it happened sometimes.

Indeed!

But is that the way your father was, Mr. Lloyd Weber?

Sir Lloyd Weber's, is that how your father was?

I- Not showing emotions.

My father was there.

Very reserved sort of a fellow.

Only told me he loved me.

Oh, you're- One thousand times.

Wait, that seems like an awful lot.

No, but it was- It was one day.

Hold on, hold on.

He got it out of his system.

I- I- I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you.

I- I was saving it up.

I have to ask what happened on that day.

What triggered this?

Oh, he felled out.

He was out of his mind.

He hit his head on a stone.

Now, when you say a stone, do you mean the equivalent of a pound in England?

I mean, a dash had rocked the other.

He'd split his skull open.

He thought he was talking to the maid.

All right, well, I- I- Unfortunately, I'm going to have to shut down questions because we were- Yeah, it's time.

It's time.

It is time.

I know.

Normally, I do this show in an hour and a half, but we have 40 minutes today, so I'm going to have to ask how you vote.

Doug Benson, how do you vote?

For what?

Yes, I think- I think medical marijuana should be legal in New Jersey.

How did this get Shanghai?

What am I voting for?

You're voting for whoa.

I don't think you'd rather- I told you roller coasters.

Okay, yeah, yeah, we know.

What the fuck?

Anything, anything you have is we're roller coaster and I'm down.

The movie roller coaster?

Roller coaster.

Okay.

Uh, Michael Ian Black, how do you vote?

He votes roller coaster too.

Anything that will alleviate stress on that war hero, Bob Dole.

I'm voting for.

Really?

And which one would that be?

Roller coaster.

Good.

RC.

All right, sir Lloyd Webber, how would you vote?

Well.
