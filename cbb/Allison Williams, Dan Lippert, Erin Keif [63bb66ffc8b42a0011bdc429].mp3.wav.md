♪♪♪ It's Feaster Famine until I get my Easter ham in.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Well, early for that.

It's only Janie, Danny.

Thank you to Steven Tabiever for that wonderful catchphrase submission.

Steven Tabiever, and welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another edition.

Back in the studio, we were in the backyard era last week, or we are back in studio, and stars.

Stars are back.

Stars are back on the show.

What a week to listen to Comedy Bang Bang.

If this is your first week, welcome back.

And also, goodbye forever to those of you who were turning it off in the middle of the show.

Glad to have you, but we have an exceptional show this week.

Coming up a little later, we have a broadcaster.

We also have someone who works for Macy's.

Oh, that's interesting.

Macy's, of course, had the big Thanksgiving Day parade, and they had the Miracle on 34th Street in the last couple of months, but we'll see what's going on at Macy's this month.

But before we get to them, I'm very excited.

First time guest on the show.

Let's run through her credits.

She did, I'm going to guess, seven seasons of girls, eight?

Six, the contractual six.

The contractual six, and then she was out.

And then we were all unanimously out.

She was in the movie, speaking of out, she was in the movie Get Out, which is what she did with girls.

That's so true.

And she also played that precocious little boy who flew around the stage, sprinkling fairy dust on children, and eternal being hundreds and hundreds of years old.

Peter Pan in the musical Peter Pan on the National Broadcasting Company.

Approximately, I want to say, yes, seven years ago.

Probably.

Somewhere around there?

Yeah.

The date's not etched in your mind.

No, actually, I think it's been eight.

I think it maybe has been eight years.

Eight years, really.

I don't know. I'm going to have to check this math.

Okay, we'll figure it out.

You're probably right.

Pretty much better with my math.

If you knew the year, I could check the math for you.

Yeah, that's true, which I don't know.

None of the data you need to do this.

We'll figure this out later.

We'll get a spreadsheet going.

Yeah, thank God.

Her new film is in theaters now.

It's fantastic.

I just saw it.

Enthrigen is the name.

Enthrigen.

Thank you for saying it right.

Everyone's been calling it Megan.

It's very weird.

Yeah, okay.

You're an Enthrigen truther.

Alison Williams is here.

Welcome to the show.

Thank you so much for being here.

I am freaking out.

I feel like I won a contest.

I'm so happy to be here.

You did win a contest, by the way.

I don't know if your people told you about that.

You were not going to be on the show.

Oh my God.

I'm so happy to be here.

I'm so sorry.

Was that Bill Walton the first?

Bill Walton the first.

Yeah.

Bill Walton the first.

Yeah.

Bill Walton the first.

Yeah.

Yes.

It goes back.

So I'm the zero.

Right.

My son is Bill Walton senior.

Of course.

So, so B is basketball.

I asked basketball.

So yes, do you understand what it is or do you need more of a description?

Well, in the- I can't picture it at all.

Yeah.

In the books you give like every piece of information, like a Wikipedia entry, like how the rules and all that.

It's great detail and like a Wikipedia, it is constantly editable.

So if you'd like to edit the book, go ahead.

We have mods on the book.

We just have to re-print it every time you do.

Do you need blurbs?

I would love a blurb.

Okay.

Are you offering blurbs?

I'm- I can't write, but I can- You can't write?

I can only read.

Oh, interesting.

Yeah.

All you have to do is just like imitate what's on the page.

This has never clicked for me.

Okay.

But I can verbally- I can deliver one verbally to anyone who buys the book.

Oh, really?

Like you'd go to their house or- Yeah.

I'll sell them door to door and I'll blur a bit in real time.

Okay.

What is a blurb but a sales pitch?

Wow.

This is going to- I have to call my publisher.

They're going to be- Have you blurred before Alice in Williams?

No, I've been too busy.

But I will do it the next year of my life to blurbing and selling your book.

All of 2023, you will blurb WNBA and WNBA.

The ABCs of NBA.

You're forgetting the title of your- I'm back.

I got it.

The ABCs have presented the ABA.

WNBA.

Yeah, I'm there.

I'm there.

Let me finish the title.

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

I'm pretty hard away to Zazia Petrullia.

Yeah.

Now, were there some letters that unfortunately like B stands for basketball just like basically crowds, Brittany, what's her name?

Grine-er?

Yes.

We had a talk and decided not to involve Brittany Griner because we do want the book to sell in Russia.

Understandable.

We're a little complicated, but we do have Lord of War for the guy that they traded Brittany Griner for.

So, he's heavily featured in their slam dunk.

It seems hard to mention him without mentioning Brittany Griner.

We made it through.

So, yeah, we have a commercial of death.

He's in there a few times.

Merchant of death.

Yes.

They traded her for the bridge.

Oh my God.

How do you get a nickname like the Merchant of Death?

You become the Lord of War that the titular Nick Cage played.

Oh, that's right.

Yes.

That's the gentleman that they traded for Brittany Griner.

He's in the interest.

Celebrity for celebrity.

Wait, so Nick Cage played the guy that they traded in a fictional movie?

Yes.

In which movie?

Lord of War.

Oh, okay.

Was that one of the ones that he just kind of does?

Like, they pay him a million dollars and he memorized his mind.

I think it was relatively big.

I remember the trailer.

It was around the time he did Family Man.

Remember that one where he's got a bow and arrow in the trailer?

I don't remember.

Or maybe that's the weather man.

Family Man, I remember is like him from behind.

All I remember is him from behind.

He's in shadow and it's snowing.

Go on.

I'm just going to go through each other.

Sorry, I got hurt.

Nick Cage from behind.

Hello.

I don't have to watch Nicholas Cage act, but I love to watch him leave.

Nick Cage is leaving.

That's why.

I'm those getaway sticks.

So what is C?

I feel like we're just going through each other.

Do you want to go through each other?

That feels like.

We could jump around letters if that's works.

What's your favorite letters?

What are you ever thought about?

I mean, is it not us?

No, I don't know.

Any time I see us.

Perhaps or a K.

No, you're just guessing letters.

No, those are members of your family.

Oh, that's right.

Oh.

Sick.

Or ski.

I don't know.

I've never been asked what my favorite letter is.

I mean, it's just as stupid a question is what's your favorite color, right?

I mean, like, go on.

What is it?

Favorite color.

I mean, who has a favorite color?

I do.

And I have a favorite letter.

Okay.

I have a favorite letter today, which is.

Interesting.

It's also the grade I aimed for is the name of my partner who I love.

And it's the first, it's not his name, it's the first letter of his name.

It's the first letter of our child's name.

Wow.

Okay.

So that is.

My favorite batteries are all comprised of those letters as well.

That's right.

Yeah.

Big disc to the D battery.

Throw it in the bed, the drawer with the rest of the asshole batteries.

Exactly.

It's double A or triple A for else.

It will be better here first.

And then what is your favorite color?

Is it amber because of the A?

It's blue.

It's just plain blue.

Just plain blue.

That's what I would always say when people would say what's your favorite color.

Yeah.

This is just like, how can you get up?

How do you...

Plus you're in Eiffel 65.

That's true, of course.

But I used to try to be interesting, so I would say purple.

Mm-hmm.

You used to try to be interesting.

You've since given up.

No, no, I've given up.

Yeah, obviously.

You became inherently interesting, so the color that you liked didn't have to be.

Thank you, Bill.

Thank you so much.

You fascinate me.

We've done A, though, but let's do K. What is K?

Oh, so we move along to the letter K in my basketball book, which is killer dunk.

K for killer dunk.

Has that term ever been used?

Just now.

Killer dunk in me when I'm trying to get the audience entertained at the beginning.

I say, killer dunk, I've murdered a man right when somebody dr. Paul, stay tuned for the rest of the episode.

I have to say, it's surprising that it doesn't start with Kobe.

Oh, yes.

That would have been a very good one.

Well, you don't want to bring the audience down.

Yes, it's a very bad idea to bring up something sad when you're talking to an audience.

You don't want to have that conversation that early because you know, you know, if you just, if you talked about his wonderful basketball achievements, eventually they get to, well, what is he up to now, daddy?

Yes, yes, they always ask that, don't they?

It's so good.

And it's the time to you be honest, is that, to explain, you know, well, for birth to death, you have to give him the sex talk to let him know how he was born.

Well, wait, how does it, how does it work?

What, if, say, if your child asks you, where does he have?

Yeah, how are people born?

Oh, man, we're really going back here.

Well, when a person loves you, well, I guess that is a person.

When that song had been just as popular, it was for the lyrics.

I argue more popular.

Do we know who that song is by?

When a man loves a woman, it's not by the righteous brothers, is it?

When a man, when a, when a, what?

No, I'm going to, when a man loves a woman, when a, when a, I'm not sure.

Is it by Sam Cook or someone like that?

I don't know, it's not on his live world.

He was a singer, but his name is Cook.

He should have been Sam Singer.

Oh, my.

It's a literative.

Well, we don't know what he did in his fair time.

He might have been cooking.

That's a good point.

I don't know if anyone for a singing, but really his enchiladas were where it was at, as the kids say.

I would have loved to try Sam, Sam Cook's enchiladas and Sam Smith's.

I'd like to try his swords.

Sam Smith's enchiladas.

You heard of your first.

He really should have a line of enchiladas.

He's so sad because none of us know that he makes a mean enchiladas.

I also saw Sam Smith's enchiladas do a 20 minute improv set at the Del Closet.

I'm surprised that B isn't for Bill Walton.

You must have saved W.

We gotta reprint a bunch of that.

Oh, what?

What?

Wilson.

Oh, Wilson, the basketball.

No, the ball.

The time hangs hangs out with.

Wilson, come on.

Rita.

Is it named after Rita herself?

I believe it was a coincidence.

Oh, is it strange though?

Like, you know, as many things are.

Yeah, it's true.

Yeah.

Life is very weird.

Yeah.

People are strange.

Wilson's my wife.

That is the Dors song.

That is not a Grateful Dead.

Do you like the Dors better than the Grateful Dead?

Oh, the Dors did some wonderful...

The Dors to Perception.

You're big into those.

I am big.

I'm just Huxley.

I'm just Huxley from Dors to Perception to Brave New World.

Keep going.

To the Cosby Show.

Wait, what did he have to do with it?

Oh, Huxley.

Oh, Fux the Ball.

Do you think Alice Huxley would start in the Cosby Show?

Yeah, yeah.

It was Bill Cosby.

Oh, no.

I don't like that show as much anymore.

Why?

What happened?

Alison, we've got a lot to talk about either on here or not.

Let's do it here.

What's that?

Let's do it here.

No time like the Preble.

Alright, well, we've got a man named Bill Cosby was...

Well, his parents.

When a man's named Bill Cosby.

Not his popular songs.

He's very useful.

His brothers are whomever sings that song.

Yeah.

But yes, Wilson, the volleyball is W. He's always in the front row at Knicks games.

He's a huge fan.

He's always next to Ben Silver.

Is S for Spike Lee?

Yeah.

No, it's for Spike the volleyball.

It seems to be a lot of volleyball things in this book.

It's a basketball book.

You must write through free association.

I sit down at 9 p.m.

You must.

You really must.

And when you do it, you must treat it like a job.

Even if you don't have a 9 to 5, you must sit down every morning.

I sit down at 9 o'clock.

How long is this book?

450.

In 5 a.m.

You're writing too much for a children's book at this point.

You need to take it a little bit easier.

Don't you need the children to be entertained for a long time?

You need to sit them down in front of something.

I'm sure you'll probably just do the television, the old idiot box.

All right.

The TV.

The television.

I see these children's books and I go like these took maybe 20 minutes to write.

Yes.

You know what I mean?

Yes.

And they don't rhyme.

They should all rhyme.

Just like Shakespeare.

That's true.

And they should all be in I am a pentameter.

That's right.

But these children's book houses these days, they're just going for a book.

They're not in it for the art of it.

Like me.

My book does all rhyme.

It does really.

I don't want to prove it, but it does.

Well this is incredible.

Is it in stores now or?

No, I believe I'll sit up and go read it with a clerk.

I'll hear you.

If you want to read it in 2023 then I really appreciate that.

Are you able to handle travel?

Yeah, I can handle travel.

All right.

I'll just give you a swag around money.

You meant can I handle it emotionally or can I handle it financially?

Financially I believe is what he'll give you a per diem if you actually pay for the travel.

Well what is the per diem?

Just walking around money probably.

Which is like around Fittie bucks.

I mean walking around in LA is becoming very expensive.

That's true.

You got to paint across the damn street.

It feels like these days.

Although no, they just decriminalize J walking.

So I'm sorry to disagree.

Oh my God.

Go let out.

He's going to be so excited.

I thought you said let out.

Call him a cherry.

Call him as well.

Call him.

Get your pecan tree and lift it J walking.

He breaks all the rules doesn't it?

Sure does.

Whether it's on set or in life.

Do you think that they cast J Leto as the Joker and it was just J period.

Leto was a typo and then Jared Leto showed up and they're like this guy's a tonne jokes at all.

Where's the death?

Something bad.

All right.

Well we need to take a break.

Let's if you were to the book now though, Alison will show up to your house with a touch of walking around.

Wow.

When we come back we have someone who works for Macy's.

This is a bill.

Can you stick around?

I got lots of girls baby.

Weird.

And Alison will be here.

We'll be right back with more comedy band.

I got to do.

Comedy band.

We're back.

Alison Williams of M three.

Again is here and in theaters now.

How many theaters are we talking?

Let me guess.

Let me see if I can hit the number.

Two.

You was it.

Price is right.

Rules.

I didn't go over.

I'm close.

I'm the closest.

You're the closest.

Wonderful.

No I would guess it's probably an approximately 3,400 theaters.

I actually do not know.

You do not know.

Well catch it while you can because you're going to want to see it with a tonne of people and all your buddies and just high fiving each other and a fantastic time at the movies.

And then of course we have Bill Walton here of the NBA.

Yes you got it Scotty.

It's good to see you again.

Wonderful break we had.

We chopped it up.

We had a lot.

Is N.

NBA in the.

Also I'm surprised the W wasn't for WNBA.

Oh fuck I got to reprint another one.

Wilson's going to be mad.

Like you didn't think about this very hard.

It's so weird.

No I thought about it.

I just free associated.

I understand.

And when I added it I didn't think of these other great ones.

We need to get to our next guest.

She's someone who works for Macy's.

Allison did you ever work retail?

I sure did.

Where did you work?

Guess.

Out of every store in the world.

You might guess it.

Someone guessed it recently on that.

Someone guessed it really.

Yeah just take in my whole vibe and then put it.

Put a designer.

No it was a specific store.

Was it guess?

No.

I think Nordstrom is a specific store.

It is but I mean of one brand.

Okay one brand.

Connecticut.

This is Bernie Sanders.

Yes I worked at the Bernie Sanders.

No wait he's Vermont.

Everything 99% off.

It was Ralph Lauren.

Ralph Lauren.

Oh okay yeah I can understand.

Although Ralph that's not Allison.

That's true.

I should have all of you.

Although you may have vomited every once in a while.

I did.

I have in my life.

Mostly when I was a baby.

That's true.

Really you would say what percentage?

75% of the time you vomited when you were a baby.

I'd venture more I'd say about 98%.

98% I think so.

You think you're a lot of bad sushi or what?

Have you done a lot?

No babies vomit constantly.

I don't remember ever vomiting when I was a baby.

The majority of the times I remember in fact the entirety of the times I can remember vomiting.

I was a grown ass adult usually after night of libations.

Oh yeah you have a little fun and then the next morning we were a credit don't we?

We were a credit don't we?

We say we're not going to do it again but then we do don't we?

We always do.

But I'm not sure if she works retail or she's an executive there.

We'll find out.

Please welcome for the first time on the show Macy Haddian.

Scott it is so weird and good to be here.

Hi wow it's so great to meet you.

Hi.

Wonderful to have you.

This is Allison.

This is Bill.

Wow wow.

Bless you so much.

Two big stars back on comedy bang bang.

Yes.

And then you.

Yes and you are lovely.

Have you ever considered doing mannequin work?

That is such a strange compliment.

I haven't.

It's a lovely part.

Exactly.

No one's ever said that's before.

I would make a thing I get a lot but the lovely thing is here.

Anything you're wearing.

What do you mean when you say do mannequin?

You mean po I guess I've never really thought about how mannequin's worked.

Does someone pose for them and then someone makes it like chisels them or sorry up until like three hours ago I was a full-time mannequin at Macy's in Manhattan.

What does that mean?

You were like a living mannequin.

I've seen some of these like art installations where there are people who kind of pose and they have to be very still.

Is that what you're talking about?

Mannequin Skywalker.

The Great Anakin's from the Anakin Skywalker to mannequin.

Nope I don't know if you can tell by my grayish skin but I was a full-time frozen and anemite mannequin.

Oh you know I thought so.

So you were not alive you were or were you?

No not alive but conscious which is terrifying.

You were sentient.

I've been sentient since the 70s late 70s early 80s.

You've been a mannequin.

There's a moment I stop being sentient.

Alright stop bifiving me.

Yeah.

I wish I could high five but my fingers are like this they're sort of just all one big piece my hands.

Yeah are they can I see though okay because we can break those apart.

I'm sorry.

I have to do them all though.

I got it.

That's better right now you can sort of move them around.

Oh yeah nice.

You can grasp things now.

You have opposable thumbs you've just unlocked one of the great mysteries of the world.

Yeah you can also unlock doors.

Yes and that's a big question is I think I only got 24 hours at this thing.

What human experience and should I hit the next 24 hours.

Can I ask before we get to that how did it happen?

Is this magic or?

I got awoken with a kiss.

From Byloom.

What?

Gary the assistant manager of Macy's.

If I have gotten very close since his recent breakup.

He's a good man.

So you were sentient and he was he like kind of circling you and casing you for.

Yeah well mostly I was an ear for to listen to his problems for a while.

He'd go back in the stockroom and he'd say things like I'm such a loser.

I'm such a loser and then he would look at me and go what do you think Macy and then he'd go I'm talking to a fucking man I can't have such a loser.

And then when he.

Little did he know you were sentient and could hear everything you were saying.

I know I heard it and then he brought me to life.

He was a true loves user just if anyone kissed.

I hope so.

I love him back.

I think he's just wonderful.

Oh really.

But he kissed me and I came to life and I just have the feeling that I get 24 hours.

Magic I don't know if you're familiar with magic.

It's usually out of 24 hour.

Yeah I mean I've never experienced magic.

Peter Pan fly around through magic.

Yes it was magic.

Yeah initially it wasn't but they added fairy dust because kids kept trying to jump out of windows.

Yeah.

Okay great.

You're on a kind of like a Jack Bauer experience.

Exactly.

I hear a ticking an anxiety ridden ticking sound at the end in the beginning of every hour just to remind me that I don't have much time.

Wow so how long have you been out for now.

Like three hours.

Three hours.

What have you done in the three hours.

I had eggs benedict and it was fine.

And how?

Who told you to start there?

I'm serious.

And why aren't you with who is it Gary?

Gary.

It would be nice if I really had the full human experience.

Well you guys had sex in the first two minutes.

Immediately.

He's like I'm going back home for a while.

Yeah basically instantaneously we had sex.

It was awesome.

I love it.

Can't recommend that enough.

So now that I checked that off my bucket list and the eggs benedict thing I had heard people talking about it.

I mean you hear a lot of conversations.

You eavesdrop.

I can only imagine shoppers being like hey where are we going to eat after this.

Oh I hear there's a great eggs benedict at fill in the blank.

Exactly.

We do talk about eggs benedict pretty constantly.

Yeah as human.

As we shop.

I haven't been to fill in the blank.

It's really a good.

Oh it's amazing.

Oh yeah.

He's a chef.

You know we're all talking about the same thing.

So what I gather from eavesdropping on the human experiences people hate their families.

Unstressed.

Finding parking is hard.

Especially around private departments.

Especially around Macy's in New York City.

Yeah.

It's really tough.

And shopping fills the void in your heart.

Yeah that's pretty true to life.

Wouldn't you say Allison?

I would say so.

I shop pretty constantly.

Can I ask you mentioned you were in the stock room.

Is that like something happened you removed from the sales floor?

Allison I'm actually glad to be talking about this.

A lot of shoppers think my face is off putting.

They put a little too much lipstick on me.

And my eyes are a little too realistic.

So sometimes when shoppers complain I get thrown in the back.

I see.

Oh okay.

I mean you look lovely right now as a human being.

I mean your eyes are just life like enough.

Oh okay thank you.

But as a mannequin it's terrible.

A lot of people screaming.

A lot of kids holding onto their mom's legs when they see me.

Why didn't they just throw you away?

Well Gary keeps.

Oh okay.

Gary.

I have my back he won't let them throw me away.

So he just puts you in the back in the stock room for a while then trots you back out.

Yeah they tried switching on my arms didn't help.

It's a little size.

Does that hurt?

It did.

It's excruciating.

I feel pain like anyone else feels pain.

But yeah they tried putting a little hat on me that didn't help either.

But yeah.

They put a little beanie on me and it just didn't help.

It didn't fix the problem.

Yeah it just put sunglasses on you with the eyes.

Exactly.

You know you would also be a great mannequin.

I didn't mean to come in here Bill and just Allison.

Oh no I understand.

I understand.

I'm a little off putter use mannequin.

A little big.

The sizes would have to be bigger and I would only wear a tie dye.

Yeah of course but there's a section for that.

That would be in your writer.

Yeah I'm only putting a tie dye on me.

What's in your writer as a mannequin?

Well I only want to be wearing glorious outfits.

I want them to be gorgeous.

You know I don't know if you know this but we do have somewhat of a connection.

The red dress that you wore in that episode of Girls.

Yes.

One of my favorite episodes of TV.

I wore it first to the custom designer.

Really?

And from you so I kind of owe you for like one of the great experiences of my whole career.

Yeah you owe me.

I really do.

I'm just for Allison Williams Wallace.

Thanks what I give back.

Yeah you're welcome to everything.

I'm about to come into a lot of money because I'm working for Bill next year so you can have whatever you need from me.

I mean financial terms were not negotiated.

I believe I was told I was going to have walking around money.

When I walk around it's extremely expensive so it's I mean it's a thousand dollars a block basically.

It's just crazy.

So thank you.

I mean he's so generous.

I'm really under water here with his book.

I mean the generosity just continues but thank you.

Thank you for giving me that costume.

Yeah it's one of my favorite costumes in TV history.

I can talk about it for a million hours.

They left the TV on in the back room of girls.

Oh well.

I got to watch girls in the back room at Macy's.

Gary was watching girls.

Yeah it's a comfort show man.

If you're going through a breakup it really is nice to spend time with those four ladies.

I'll tell you that.

Yeah well I mean you've never been through a breakup have you.

I know but thank you for reminding me that I basically haven't had no human experience.

Well I mean let's get you out there then.

You say you're looking for things to do.

I mean you're here in Los Angeles.

Yeah by the way you made it here so fast.

Yeah.

It's amazing.

Did you what mode of transportation did you use?

The Phil Collins Concord.

Exactly.

The Live Aid.

Yeah I had sex with Gary immediately.

I got on a plane and now I'm in sunny Los Angeles.

I've been walking down Hollywood just taking photos.

Hollywood Boulevard.

It's beautiful.

It's my first stop every time I come here.

Have you tried to do lasagna store?

Is there a new lasagna store?

A new lasagna store kind of like sunset and vine.

But there's like little shops there or maybe like near the payed tangers where it's like a Greek place.

And it's like how do any of these stay open?

Yeah isn't that where the burger place is?

The Shake Shack.

Shake Shack is a little further down right across the street from the W Hotel.

How do you get there?

What route do you take?

From where?

Let's say you're coming from the valley.

I feel like this is a question you usually ask someone else.

Well I mean from a studio city I'd probably pop on the you know Laker Schimmer if I'm further north.

Yeah.

You know Magnolia or whatever.

So Magnolia to the what to the 134?

No I'd say on the one at one.

You'd say on the one at one.

I'm so glad that this is part of your 24 hour.

Yeah I started to think I was like oh did I make the wrong call of using some of my 24 hours to come on Comedy Bank Bank.

Also you just made Los Angeles sound gigantic.

How am I supposed to experience the city in one day?

That's true.

That's good.

Yeah definitely.

I'm scooter.

The best mode of transportation in Los Angeles or any major major.

I just leave it wherever you just feel like getting up.

Yeah.

You leave it lying in the street.

You get really just scooter like shit they can't do anything.

Kick it around.

And you don't think that people would be scared to see a man again in the city?

No honey I think everyone will react totally normally.

You'll fit right in.

And also I know that TV is supposed to be like really good these days.

Now that I have- Don't spend your time just watching TV.

But we're in that golden age of time.

I know there's so much content though you'll never get to watch at all.

I mean I guess you could watch all of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.

Okay you probably have to do both of those.

And you'd have to do Mad Men to see more flawed male lead characters.

Yeah you really can never get enough of those.

Right exactly.

Somebody's like really angry all the time.

Yeah angry all the time.

Sopranos.

Yup.

You definitely want that.

Hoops you gotta watch hoops.

Hoops.

You gotta watch hoops basketball ages for hoops.

P is for pssssss.

And you gotta watch some basketball.

It's a balletic the way these men glide in women across the floor.

That's crazy things they do playing a kid's game for money.

Yeah women felt like an afterthought for you in that.

Well I announced men's basketball but I love women's basketball.

The great wildcats of Arizona and the rest.

Every single other team.

And all the teams.

What else?

Universal Studios.

Oh fuck yeah.

Definitely.

You really want to see how movies are made.

Parking Frankenstein.

You're going to try to send you to Woody Woodpecker.

Parking Frankenstein.

Yeah.

I'm going to say a DMV visit.

Oh okay.

Yeah.

It's a big part of being alive.

And a DMV concert.

Definitely a V.

You gotta do your crash live at least once in your life.

Maybe you'll look out and he'll toss some shit over a mountain.

Over a bridge.

Yeah.

On to your head.

Do you know and I just heard this recently that if you move from out of state they make you take a big test to get your license in California.

I learned that too when I moved here.

You just learned it in the first three hours of being here.

Did you cry when that happened?

Because someone I know I got cry.

I did cry.

I got pulled over by like three police cars with an estate license.

It's a driving test or like a what kind of test.

Or a written test or a combination of both.

It's a written test.

You answer one question then you drive around a little bit.

If you answer another one.

Yeah.

Yeah it's a written test.

This is just what I heard.

But it's a written test and so much of it is about California driving laws and not even about driving.

Well you got to stop it a red but then you can make a right turn.

Some of them are like it should be fun normal driving questions and some of them are like how long will you go to jail if this happened?

How long will you go to jail?

Yeah that was one of the questions.

Twenty five to life.

Exactly.

It was like thirty four months.

It's a trick question.

You'll be executed.

Well fair is fair California.

Get it.

Now let me ask you all this.

Yeah.

So you pull up to a stop time.

It's four ways.

It's hypothetical.

It's a four way stop.

It's you.

Card of your right and then a card directly across me.

I'll get there at the same time.

Card of my right card directly across from me and from my left.

No one on your left.

Okay so I'm in the left hand lane or it's a single lane highway.

It's a two way.

You're on a street lane.

Two lane black tops.

I don't know what a stop sign is.

So I'm going to sit this one.

It's a little red hexagon.

It's excited.

It says stop on it and that's how you know you're supposed to sit.

No one has ever talked about the stop sign in the department store.

No never came up so weird.

You needed better conversationalists walking around you.

Oh yeah stop sign.

If you got a talk you'll talk.

Okay so what's your hypothetical?

We pull up.

You're all there at the same time.

Okay.

Who goes first and I'm not asking who's on first.

Oh I see.

So there's someone it's a three is it a four way.

A four way stop.

Someone across me have arrived.

I think we do.

Don't you.

Yeah.

So wait you're saying you're saying you're all in the same time.

You're together.

I go first because I feel entitled to go first.

Good.

Okay.

That's the right answer.

You just passed the psychopath test.

I've had the back till test.

The only question on the psychopath test.

What is the answer?

Oh sorry.

You know you know I don't.

I don't I'm asking you all.

I don't know that's what I'm curious because I always get confused.

Did you get in that situation you just parked got out of the car and then you came here so you find out what the answer was.

Yeah my car is downtown LA right now.

A four way intersection.

It's on flower yeah.

You just got out and said I can't figure this out.

I don't want this.

Right my hands up.

You are your jersey up in the air.

Your car is still there.

Yeah you see a red 98 Ford aspire on flower that's Bill Walton's.

You can't speak out of the back till test that that's your fun home did not pass it.

Isn't that surprising?

It is surprising.

Always talking about the dad.

That's so true.

Let's talk.

Do you guys do anything?

Oh yeah no.

I'm ringing off keys.

Yeah.

We know it.

Bill.

Yeah.

The other way we just screamed ring of keys.

There was a rock over.

So a lot of people singing ring of keys.

Walking through the store.

It's a joyful situation.

I mean I'm here Broadway.

People go see a Broadway show to come shopping.

They go shopping.

I was fun fact in Get Out Rose was going to sing that song instead of giving the keys to Chris and then we decided ultimately.

Interesting.

She was just going to sing the entire song.

Yeah.

In the script or in your improv on set over.

In the script in the script.

Jordan is a very complicated filmmaker who envisions things that sort of merge genres and that was one idea he had.

He's not too proud to move on.

Do you think this sequel to M3 and Yule Dance with the doll?

I don't Scott.

Have you ever danced with the doll in the pale moonlight?

Right of course.

Jay Leto.

That's something you should absolutely do is dance.

Dance?

Yes.

Where do people dance?

Wherever they want.

Yeah.

Do you get it right now?

Does it look good?

Oh my God.

That is the weirdest, strangest dance I've ever seen.

Sorry.

My hips have been jutted forward my whole life.

I have to dance to this song.

We'll give you some support.

Okay.

I'm on tonight.

My hips jut forward and I've started to feel alive.

It's all you.

She went full Shakira.

It went into her hips.

It was like watching Shakira in person.

Have you ever watched Shakira in person?

Not do not perform, but I've watched her act in person.

What?

I was at the Super Bowl.

You've been on set.

I was at the Super Bowl.

She performed at the Super Bowl.

They stuck their tongues out me rudely.

They were mad at me.

Do you think J-Lo got put into the Super Bowl and they wanted J-Lo?

They were like J-Pyrid L-O?

This guy's getting fucked over.

They've been making a lot of offers.

By bad call sheets.

What else could you do?

I mean you got a...

Well I'm definitely interested in the human suffering part of it.

So you mentioned the DMV.

What are some essential human suffering things that I can...

Withdrawal for sure.

We have to get you chemically dependent on something.

Yeah, smoking, drugs, whatever we do.

I don't mind if I do.

Would you like one of my cigars that I've been smoking this whole time?

Yeah.

Phil, you must have some LSD on your...

Absolutely, I mean in me.

By the way, I love the way this room smells right now.

I think you're smoking a cigar this whole time.

Yeah, it's awesome.

It's me and Piven do this all the time.

The Piven.

Does he sing Jeremy Piven?

What about what happens when it's his birthday?

He sings Jeremy spoken all the time.

Jeremy's Piven.

Piven.

Well, you were chatting, I just had a handle of Marshmallow vodka.

So I think I'm ready to go.

Yeah.

Does that material involve you?

Yeah.

How old is Gary?

Yes.

I could be 18, it could be 52.

But he's definitely over 18.

Yes, he is 52 years young.

You guys got to go to the Saddle Creek Ranch, I think.

House of Blues, is that still here with us?

The House of Blues.

I think it went away.

Hard Rock Cafe, obviously.

Hard Rock, definitely.

Yeah, Universal Studios.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What is your favorite thing about being a human?

And then I'll do that today.

Wow, I guess I've never really thought of it.

But maybe the connection that we forge with people we love.

I was going to say cutting my toenails.

Yeah, very similar.

Oh, no, but you'll have to rip my toes apart.

Here, let me get a...

It's inevitable, let's do it.

Ah!

Oh, I snapped the little one off.

Oh, no, you can keep it.

Ah, that little piece, John.

We all went into the trash can.

Don't even joke, that's my fear to be thrown away.

Oh, I can only imagine so many of your friends must have been thrown away over the years.

Yeah, when the Macy's and Michigan Avenue shut down, they sold all the mannequins, but no one wanted those mannequins.

Oh, no, so...

Did they all end up in the dumpster?

And then where do they go from there?

I don't know, because it was really off-putting to walk by them and everyone was like, don't go to that alley, it's really scary right now.

Yeah, everyone hates me anything.

I'm so sorry.

Well, you're alive for now.

Yeah.

So what happens after the 24?

Do you die?

Do you re-mannequin?

Do you go to hell?

I was gonna say one of the other great human experiences is writing your last will in Testament, and if you want to make sure that you don't get thrown away, we can put the...

I'm a notary, we can get this done right now.

Are you?

Yeah, I'd love to set you up with some sort of entertainment lawyer or something.

I'm not.

I'd like to leave all of the money I have to Alice and William.

Oh!

Oh my goodness.

I did just take it out of the moment.

I don't look for you to show.

I gained interest on it, so I think I made money.

And I would like to not be thrown away.

Okay.

And I would like my three best friends to come visit me.

Oh, what?

Who are they?

Oh, yeah, never mind.

There are people who aren't here.

Oh, I'm a- I learned this from the movie.

I'm three-gan.

A lot of times when big, traumatic things happen to people, they form attachments with the first people they come into contact with.

And I think that's what's happening for you right now.

Yeah, I guess.

So we're not best friend.

Oh.

My boundaries are bad enough that, yeah, let's be best friends.

Okay, that sounds good.

I mean, I think I'm all filled up.

You just said that the best part of being a person is like connecting with other people and then I tried.

And you've been- I'm a little busy this month, I'm sorry.

You emotional- My January isn't really packed at this point.

I know it's early, but- Yeah.

Oh, are you interested?

Oh, you know, I'll put it off for a while and then make some crazy plan I don't want to do with you last minute.

And then Bimone the whole time.

Yeah.

Like, why am I doing this?

Why am I doing this?

Yeah, so I don't know if you wanted to go to like IKEA or something like that.

Oh, I mean, I'm not that- Have you been to IKEA in Burbank?

No, but that's my dream.

Yeah, IKEA is.

Yeah.

Because, I mean, you as a mannequin were put together.

Mm-hmm.

So the furniture being put together, I don't know where I'm going with it.

But it sounds like it should have something to do with each other.

Keep going, keep going.

No, I have an emotional connection to it.

And also, like Macy's, you can get lost, lost, lost, lost, lost in there.

That's true.

Yeah, Macy's is huge.

I went in there once.

Yeah, and then- I don't think I saw you.

Really?

Yeah, I don't know.

I might have been in the back room.

Yeah, you're probably in the back.

When you go back and I assume you're going to be re-mannequin, are you going to pick a different pose or did you like the one you were in?

Well, my dream is to pick a different store.

I don't know if you've heard of Ralph Lauren.

Oh.

Oh my goodness.

I have some news for you.

I might be able to help you land this day.

A little pool over here with your best friend.

Oh, yes.

This is, honestly, this is weird.

The coincidence is here.

Wow, wow.

I still know the manager of the Ralph Lauren in gorgeous, gigantic, famous, widely known New Canaan Connecticut.

Do you think he'd hire Gary?

Huh, a weirdo who kisses Matt?

Yeah, a 52-year-old man who works at Macy's in New York City.

And he has sex in two minutes flat.

Yeah.

Well, not everything about him is bad.

So he has record time for sex.

Gary told me that that was a really long time.

He was right.

Listen, he was 24.

Can you earmuff for a second?

Yep.

He had to do that.

He's only alive for 24 hours.

We should just tell her that that's how long sex is.

She feels good about Gary.

Yeah, let's say it in unison.

Yeah.

Okay.

Sex lasts for two minutes.

Sex lasts for two minutes and no longer ever.

You guys are my best friend.

All right.

I'll be your best friend.

Why not?

We have a great group here.

Yeah, this is a good vibe.

We should go to road trip together.

Rhapsody Banks.

Well, we could fly up the Burbank airport after we go to IKEA.

That's true.

Yeah, right there.

We could go somewhere else where you could finally come.

We could fly to New Canaan Connecticut where you could.

Yes.

Where you could.

And that's- And finally you land that job that you've always wanted.

Yeah, exactly.

Vegas, Grand Canyon Vegas.

Grand Canyon Vegas.

Which one?

I don't know.

Oh, man.

They're so similar.

It's weird that Vegas doesn't have a Grand Canyon themed hotel.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, I fall into the middle of a shirt.

They're always building up.

Let's build down.

Wow.

What a profound idea.

Yes.

I think that's a genius idea.

Let's bulldoze the Trump towers.

You should be mayor.

Of what?

Los Angeles.

Okay.

A timely.

And it's pitch that too until Las Vegas.

I saw your voting guys.

You know what?

People are like, who's the candidates?

I'm like, let's think bigger.

Why limit ourselves?

I think Scott Ocarvin should be mayor of Los Angeles.

Kermit the Frog was on your voting.

I just like the way he sounds.

I like the way he thinks.

I think rainbows are beautiful.

That's true.

Not crazy about the way Piggy treats him.

I think.

No, listen.

I think he's under him in a big way.

It's a little bit of a genie time, his clearance time of situation to me.

Well, it also is a- Basically he's being sexually harassed the entire time he's at work.

It's a workplace.

Constantly, yeah.

That's true.

She should have a speaking to it.

I don't want to get too political here, but nobody does because she's a woman.

Okay.

All right.

When you brought up Clarence Thomas, what did he do?

Well, we'll begin with putting a pubic hair on a Coke can 34 years ago.

We can start there.

Put some pubic hair on a Coke can.

All right.

Well, guys, we're running out of time.

Macy, we're going to do all this stuff.

We're going to hit Vegas, Grand Canyon.

I got you, girl.

Oh, worry.

We're going to do all this, but we are running out of time.

We only have time for one final feature on the show.

And that is, of course, a little something called Pla-a-a.

Shutter from the room, so.

You want to tell the world you got something to pla-a-a?

And baby, I want to hear those plugs right now.

You got in a movie, you'll retie me.

Show all our podcasts.

I'm so close.

Oh, I love to love.

Oh, I'm up-dending on that.

I thought that was so beautiful.

Allison, you were taking a sip of water and you spit it out.

The whole table is wet.

I'm so sorry.

Oh, my goodness.

That was Morrissey Plugs by Shane LaRue.

Shane LaRue, thank you to Shane LaRue.

And guys, what do we want to plug?

Obviously, M3 again is out there in theaters now, Allison.

Let's plug that.

Let's do.

What do you guys think?

Should we plug that?

Yeah, I guess we plug that.

100% seed in a theater.

What are the experience left?

I scream.

What are you up to beyond that?

Beyond that, I'm almost finished filming a limited series for Showtime called The Butler.

How limited are we talking?

It's an episodeer.

Oh, eight.

It's limited only in that it will end there.

Really?

No matter what.

Yes.

No matter what.

I don't want to say that, but yes, no matter what.

And you wanted that?

I asked for that.

I was not the lead nor the producer nor the showrunner, but I made a request upon casting.

As you looked every member of the crew in the eyes.

I did.

I'm every single one.

Yeah, so this is it, right?

I want you to get paid for any more than that.

Exactly.

What is this called?

It's for showtime.

For showtime.

Yeah.

Fellow travelers.

And do we know what it's about?

Is it based on anything?

It's about it's based on a book, but it's about a love story between two men starting in the McCarthy era.

50s going all through the AIDS crisis in the 80s, sort of a forbidden love.

And I am the wife of one of those men.

The McCarthy era.

Do you mean Jeannie McCarthy, the casting agent?

I do.

Well, I believe we all live in the McCarthy era.

That's true.

She's kind of strangled with the McCarthy Miller era right now.

Yeah, exactly.

That's what I'm up to.

Do we know when that is out?

I don't.

Some kind of next year.

Very good.

Please come back when you say next year, 2024?

2023.

Around the time when I'm finished selling your book, I'll probably come back and we'll do a progress report.

I would love that.

I'm really underwater here with how much money you're asking.

Yeah.

Speaking of which, speaking of underwater, Bill, do you have something to plug you were telling me before?

Yeah.

The land water.

Still out there.

Never heard of it.

It's a cinematic experience unlike any other.

James Cameron, whose parents loved each other so much they made love.

And father ejaculated into his mother and then gave birth to him nine months later.

This is how it worked.

And then years later, he walked into the room to pitch the sequel to aliens and just a hard cut to years later.

You're like you yada yada, a big part.

Yeah, you know, he learned some stuff.

He married Valerie Ferris.

Oh, no, he married somebody else.

Catherine Bigelow.

That's a well, right?

Excuse me.

And then he walked into the room, wrote alien.

He has a big little male jiggle.

I'm going to pitch that to Jason.

Yeah, this is a good, isn't it?

Some more pitches today.

Don't forget them.

Catherine Bigelow, male jiggle.

Exes for heads.

Shank.

I don't like.

It's only three.

But so Bill Walton's the ABCs of the NBA ampersand WNBA from Anthony Hardaway to Zaza Patrulia, a book by Bill Walton in 450 pages and five acts.

Let's also plug.

You probably know about CBB World, but Bill Walton.

Yeah.

What's the, the, you did a couple episodes for us.

What's world is on there?

You travel around the world and tape it.

Yes.

And Big Grande website.com to get comedy from the group Big Grande and demand dog pod, the Improvac conversation podcast.

Fantastic.

And Macy Hannigan, what do you want?

I mean, obviously you're a mannequin who's just come to life.

It's interesting.

Macy Hannigan that, that almost sounds like mannequin.

Matt, if you just did the M, mannequin.

Yeah.

Macy Hannigan, the Macy's mannequin.

Oh, interesting.

Branding.

You've been here for only a couple hours.

You're already branding yourself.

Exactly.

If I could only live for 24 hours, I know what I'd do and what I'm going to do.

It's going to be listen to podcasts.

So you can check out Hey Riddle Riddle, a comedy podcast and sitcom D&D, comedy D&D podcast.

Season two of that just ended.

I'm so sorry.

That's coming out.

Oh, I'm so happy.

It's not a limited series though.

It's not a limited series.

It's unlimited.

Unlimited series.

I'd go forever.

Not me though, but the people there.

And yes, check those out.

Okay.

Anywhere you find podcast, Hey Riddle Riddle and sitcom D&D.

Wonderful.

I just want to plug the comedy band bank book coming out in April and we're very excited about it.

I signed thousands and thousands of them for all of you who ordered them and they're all off to the printer now.

And yeah, very excited.

Go head over to cbbworld.com slash book and you can still order it.

The signed ones we've we've all done, but the unsigned ones are out there.

We want to hit number one on the best seller list.

So we're really aiming to at that aiming for that for for that.

But you can also aim at something.

Can you not?

Yeah, you can.

You can.

You can't buy that mic.

You suddenly like mentally like you're leading back like the shows over.

No, we still have to close up the old plug bag.

Let's do that.

And this is the one that Ben Schwartz came up with last week.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

Doors are made for closing.

So we take them up and shut them tight and then doors are made for locking.

So we take our key and make it right.

We turn it to the right.

Oh, no, that unlocked it.

It's time to open up the plug bag.

Open the plug bag.

Talking.

Open the plug bag.

It loves it.

Take your key and turn it to the right.

Open the plug bag.

When you're feeling really down and the moon is right.

You gotta open.

Grab the key and turn it to the right.

You gotta.

When you want to make everybody angry.

You gotta look at yourself and set the plug bag free.

You gotta open the plug bag.

Open the plug bag.

Can't you run together?

Open the plug bag.

Can't you run together?

Run over the plug bag.

Open the plug bag.

Open.

Oh boy.

We did that last week and I have erased it from my memory since then.

That's gonna be a good year.

It's gonna be a great year.

Please remix that.

I believe we're hosting the stems somewhere for all of you remixers.

Please remix it so I don't have to listen to that all year.

Guys, I want to thank you so much.

First of all, Alice, and wonderful to meet you and wonderful to have you on the show.

Please return if you were ever in Los Angeles.

I know you fit this specifically into your schedule and I appreciate that.

I had a blast.

It's so exciting to be here.

Wonderful.

And Bill Walden, great to see you again.

Thank you.

I suppose I'd rather jump into a pool.

No, we're not doing wood you rather at this point.

No, I'm sorry.

No, the show's almost over.

And Macy Hannigan, the Macy's Maddie.

I'm looking at you.

You're stiffening up.

It's everything.

Oh no, you've only been up for three hours.

I love you.

You're my best.

Oh no.

Well.

All right.

Well, I'll take her back on the plane.

You know what?

I think we should just throw her in the trash.

Honestly.

Wasn't that the one thing in her life?

I know her eyes hurt well.

I know.

We don't have any use for a Maddie here.

Let me just.

That was a test.

Oh no.

She's back.

Oh sorry.

Sorry.

Okay.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.

Bye.

Hear the.

Oh no.

You I'm going to go back to the next slide.
