♪♪ I came, I saw, I conquered, I ordered a cheese Danish.

I watched an episode of Frasier, I came again.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Hmm, thank you to Johann Sebastian Kuck for that catchphrase submission.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

Great to have you here.

My name is Scott Ockermann.

I'm the host.

We have an exciting show.

Coming up a little later, I don't quite know who this is.

Okay, this is a terrible way to start the show, but we have someone coming on later.

Great, great.

And what year of the podcast is this?

The 14th year at this point.

14th and you really nailed the openings.

Hey, why don't you point that at your mouth?

What do you say?

The microphone.

You're pointing it at the bottom of your beard.

Oh, I was trying to engage with you.

I was trying to give you eye contact.

I'm trying to connect.

I understand, but you know you're on a professional sound recording right now.

You're being combative just to shift focus away from that absolute dog shit opening.

Well, this is the true exciting part.

Why we're so elated to be doing the show today.

Oh, we're just.

Because an old friend of ours is no longer shut into his house.

He has come out and is ready to meet the world again.

Straight out of my closet.

I'm in the studio, baby.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Jason Manzukas is here.

Wow, what a delight.

The energy is palpable.

It is electric to be in the room.

It truly is to be.

To be in the room where it happened.

Mir two feet away.

Would you say that's two feet?

If that, if that we're practically shoulder to shoulder.

Practically standing on the shoulders of giants here.

Jason, you of course know from his own podcast, How Did This Get Made?

As well as playing every scumbag known to earth in all of your favorite movies and television shows.

All of them.

All of the favorite ones.

Yes.

Yeah, I saw there was a meme of you going around recently.

I don't know.

Do we know that?

You on the league saying something that I can't remember what it pretended to.

Got it, okay.

Yeah.

But it was like, you know those kind of things were on Twitter.

Someone will go like when you and then something in the news.

Okay.

When you do such and such and then a little picture of you saying whatever it was.

Got it.

I wish I had more info.

You know, you are light on specifics today.

Light on content.

You are like you've decided today you're going to broad strokes.

I'm not going to drill down into specificity at all.

I'm just going to broad stroke.

I need to start preparing for this show.

14 years in.

You might try.

That might be the end.

14 years done.

Jason, it's good to see you.

Oh, Scott.

It's fantastic to see you.

You are here in the year.

Well, studios.

Look at that.

You are.

And not only that, you're with me for a number of firsts.

You were there when I saw my first movie since the pandemic.

You returned to the movie theaters top of Maverick.

Yes, I'd seen it already, but I wanted to see it with you because we did top gun on your show.

Scott hasn't seen.

That's right.

And we can talk about it a little bit because I think people will be interested to know our reactions to it because there is a very famous episode of Scott hasn't seen where you and I watched the first top gun.

So famous.

You know what I'd say?

It's more almost famous.

I get that.

But we watched the first top gun and I did not care for it, which I was surprised by, but I guess I understand.

Yes.

I thought you were going to dig it more.

I got excited to do top gun with you.

Right.

Because I was like, oh, I think he's going to, I understand why you didn't like it or didn't think you would like it when it came out.

Right.

But I thought you were going to be a reaction to it that I thought I would have when it came out.

Yeah, you had a very teenager reaction to it.

Teenager.

Come on.

I'd be like, I'd be grown up adult reaction.

I feel like you looked at it through the lens of your teenage self who is like, this sucks.

I don't think it's like this popular movie stinks.

Here's my, here's my opinion.

I don't think it's that well made of a movie in terms of structure and emotional connection and all that kind of stuff.

But what I'm here to tell you, and this is a follow up to our famous episode, is that I really liked the sequel.

And if taken together as one long five hour movie, I then like the original.

Boy, I love the lot.

Because the sequel, the sequel redeems the original in my opinion.

Yeah, no, I agree.

I do agree with that.

The sequel writes a couple of things that in the in the first version are pretty not great, you know, but having now rewatched the original a bunch of times, I just love it as like both a piece of nostalgia and like kind of just wonderful speaking of broad strokes, broad strokes filmmaking.

Like it's a Tony Scott movie that is just like this whole piece of it is the hue of orange that I like, you know, and then and then and this movie does that and then it was down on it with and then adds blue.

And boy, oh boy, was that a great text to dive into.

Oh, truly was.

And also you had another first that night you saw the Nicole Kidman AMC ad for the first year.

Yes, I had never seen the Nicole Kidman at we're back at the movies thing, which was somehow heartbreak feels good in a place like this.

Unsettling.

I didn't like it.

They're not going to sequel though right now.

It is interesting to see.

Oh, thank God.

We'll sequel will redeem the first one for you.

Let's hope.

It is interesting to see Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise back together on our screen.

Back to back because she she was like, first of all, what's weird about this?

She's doing her Australian accent, right?

Well, she is Australian.

She is Australian, but she's not doing a fake Australian accent.

Although I wonder, but she's she's doing the Australian thing for the entirety of the commercial until the very end when her line is they are, because it's like, if you think such as I can't remember these tactics, if you think such and such is great in here, it's because they are.

And she says they are and she hits the hard R because I think in her Australian accent with such a pause in between the first part of the sentence and the second, she'd just be going, they are.

And it would sound weird.

It would sound as a weird, a weird end to a thought.

So she she's Australian until the very last two words.

Well, you know, she's one of our greatest actors and that's that's the kind of variety she's giving you in any spot or anything you're seeing.

You're seeing somebody who's not afraid to say, who knows where I'm fucking from.

So she says they are.

Yeah.

And then suddenly Tommy C pops up on her screen is like, ha ha ha, welcome back to the movies.

He does his own.

Welcome back to the movies.

We made this for you.

A competing one.

I swear to God, I said this to you when we were there.

I think he is going to die trying to make a movie for us.

He is I think fully so.

He's trying to, you know, he and Doug Lyman say they're going to make a movie in outer space like in low orbit or something like that.

This is they, I think he want he is doing things that are so and then you sent me a video of him like standing on the wing of an airplane flying.

Yeah.

What is this?

I don't know.

At a certain point, yeah, post jumping on the couch Katie Holmes Oprah.

That was his first stunt.

Do you agree with that?

I feel like since he's like, hey, this feels good man.

I've got to distract.

I can only do stunts in movies.

I can't do them on couches or talk shows anymore.

I'm not allowed to do them on couches.

Well, he's it's wonderful to see him again.

It's wonderful to see you.

Boy, I had a blast.

Yeah.

Seeing you seeing him my two best friends.

We also went to.

Thank you.

I'm a wonderful company.

Oh, yeah.

I'm keeping.

We also went to the Hollywood Bowl to see Duran, Duran together.

Oh, I guess we did.

Yes.

I guess we did.

Of course we did.

I have totally forgotten that we did that.

It's almost as if it's upcoming.

First concert back, first movie back, first AMC, Nicole Kidman ad back.

Holy cow.

We're doing a lot together.

And this podcast.

And look at this.

This podcast not to maybe, maybe chief among them is to be sharing space in the room to do an episode of this legendary now very bad podcast.

Formerly legendary currently very bad podcast.

Well, it's a pleasure to have you.

You're one of our favorite guests.

Boy, oh boy.

What a time.

What a time to be alive.

It truly is.

Yeah.

As the, you know that Chinese curse.

Oh, I don't.

May you live in interesting times.

Oh, yes.

Yes.

And we certainly do.

Wow.

Boy, do we.

You know, thank you.

Why did you put your hands to your like that?

I was giving you prayer hands to be like, okay, it looked like you were doing like, oh, Chinese.

No, no, no, I was giving you prayer hands to say thank you for giving me that.

That will add it would be offensive.

I was saying, thank you for giving me that blessing.

Oh, what else is going on?

Obviously you were out there on the the reason you're here.

You were out there on the, how did this get made tour, which lasted?

How many stops?

We did.

Devin is laughing in the other room because he was supposed to be there.

You absolutely would have gotten it.

Devin for real.

It was dicey.

I was, you know, as many people who listened to the show know, I've literally almost not left my house entirely in the last two and a half years.

You've been in my backyard in the end.

A few things like that.

Yes.

But so, you know, to really go out into the world and I did a couple of jobs and then like the real thing was to do the how did this get made tour of the Midwest.

Which ops, you busting tables again?

I went back to the, you know what?

You know, I decided I was like, it's been a, you know, a bit of time now.

I'm going to start from scratch.

I got to get minimum wage.

I'm going to reenter the service industry.

I buy was a bus boy.

I worked my way up to minimum wage these days, 50 an hour or what exactly is five zero boy.

You so out of touch.

Wow.

The liberal elite, the West Coast Hollywood elites don't even know what the minimum wage.

What is it like?

Probably 4,000 a week like WGA minimum.

Yeah.

Totally.

Yep.

And everybody gets healthcare and everybody's doing dynamite.

Oh man, the healthcare man, that went away from me during the pandemic.

Yeah.

Mee.

Gia.

I got a 10 the volume in my cans.

Bye.

So we did New Orleans, Dallas and Houston.

How was New Orleans?

Did you, anyone throw you some beads for showing nobody?

Nobody.

I kept the mask.

Who wants to see him?

Nobody.

Yeah.

So you did New Orleans.

And what?

I think I got sick.

I think I got it.

This is the only place I can, then I have a memory of, ooh, I didn't like that vibe or I didn't like that feeling was I was, I was walking past a CVS and an elderly woman was walking into the CVS and so crossed right in front of me.

And while she crossed in front of me, she coughed.

So then I proceeded to walk through her cough cloud and then she walked into the CVS and said, Hey, what do you do if you have COVID?

That's what I felt like was happening.

I felt like a sick woman with COVID was going in to pick up her pegs, lovid prescription or something.

Anyway, so I think that's where I got it.

But we've been blaming because it's funny, a baby that was brought on stage during the Houston show, even though the baby was like 40 feet away from me.

Yeah.

And you got it.

But the baby started coughing a lot.

No, no, no.

So I think I think that baby has been unfairly scapegoated, although, you know, I hope they grow up with that sort of shroud over them.

Yeah.

I hope that baby knows this.

It's killed American treasure.

Jason mentioned what you call a week.

Close call, baby.

Yes.

Greece does claim me.

Um, so yeah, then I was stuck in a hotel in Houston for a week, which was really just crummy.

Was that a problem?

I did say a number of times I would call down to the front desk and I would say Houston, I have a problem.

I have COVID.

I have COVID-19.

Did you change it now?

Because Houston, we have a problem jokes are old hat and I'm sorry.

I even made it.

Just change it to Houston.

I have COVID.

There you go.

Houston, I have COVID.

Can we all start saying that now?

Yeah.

Instead of you.

Sound like you're calling someone named Houston, like the porn star Houston.

I don't know who that is.

This is like from the 80s, I think.

This is like an old thing.

But you were there in Houston.

You're now out and about to have a how long.

I'm getting a vanting.

It's a ticking clock.

It's like that Justin Timberlake movie where I've heard of a couple of people who've gotten it like twice within a month.

So it's I don't think we live in a time anymore.

That's not happening to you.

That's not going to win.

I don't think we live in a time anymore where after you get COVID, you have three months of unimpeded kind of freedom.

So I'm kind of gauging like a month.

Although when you walked in, I sort of heard George Michael's freedom or freedom.

I'm sorry.

This is by the way.

Maybe I have my mind on my other show.

You are not.

I'm mentally doing that one right now.

Is that your primary?

Is that not my primary?

Yeah, that's number one.

Because you're like, this is slick to number four.

I wish I was doing a free show.

Oh, why do I have to?

Dr. Jason.

Oh, I'll even interrupt my own bad joke to Freudian slip the other show.

You couldn't even deliver your Michael.

Freedom.

George Michael's show.

Couple more episodes before the or maybe it's done by now.

I'm not sure.

But you're out there.

You're I mean, you must be living it up right now.

Not really.

But I mean, I've done the few things that you've mentioned, which were terrific.

Yeah.

And I've really enjoyed it.

I haven't been going.

I still want to poo ball.

I'd like to see.

Yeah, no, I've got to go back to La Poobell.

Because you don't know.

La Poobell is a shitty bar that's next to you.

Allegedly, I don't want to get sued.

No, but I mean, like I'd like because I keep talking to people who are like the minute I got it, I booked trips, you know, like, and I haven't done anything like that.

You should.

I should go somewhere.

Yeah, where do you want to go?

I'm I that's the fact I'm not.

Fuck yourself.

To hell.

You know, I mean, there are plenty of places I'd like to go.

I know you went to Italy recently or not recently a couple months ago.

That's a great one.

I'd love to go to like, I've never been to Portugal.

Yeah.

There are places I'd like to go.

I mean, I'd like to go honestly.

I'd like to just go back to New York for a beat.

I haven't been to New York in ages.

You should just pack up and go.

You know, I'll see you later.

No, not right now.

No, we only have one guess that I don't even know who they are.

I'm pecking up my bag.

You sort of knocked on the table like it was your footsteps, but you made no sound.

Okay.

See you later.

Come on back.

I read.

I'm here.

Okay, he's back.

Oh, my horse.

My studio horse.

Have you ever ridden a horse?

Who's been feeding my studio horse?

Oh, wait, you keep a studio horse here?

Oh, yeah.

It's Hollywood, baby.

I keep a horse at all the places that I go.

So you you're traveling horse to horse?

Yeah.

I drive to the next location and then I only use a horse on on.

We're at the location.

At the studio or yeah.

Yeah.

You know how you go to a set?

Sometimes you go to a like a lot and people will be riding bikes between stages or golf carts or whatever.

I ride a horse.

Interesting.

From my trailer to set from my step back to trailer.

It's like, okay, Mr. Mancugas, we're ready for your own set.

Okay.

Mount my, mount my horse or put my saddle on the horse.

Jason, now it is, of course, it's Thursday today.

We're taking this in advance of the show.

It's Thursday, September 8th is what it is.

One of the great days.

I have it a great day myself.

Oh, I'm loving it.

And I'm loving getting to see you.

I'm loving getting to hang out.

It's sunny.

Nothing in the world is happening of any consequence.

I love those days where you it's kind of like just like a you can check out.

It's a coast day.

Yeah.

Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, stop everything.

What?

Stop everything.

Everything?

Myron, myron, even us talking right now.

I'm tired.

They stop it.

Stop talking right now.

Do you want to, do you want to sit down?

Yes.

I think I will.

Yeah, please.

Stop standing above the.

You can understand.

Bring the mic up to your mouth.

I came in with like a lot of effort and stood well above the mic.

Well, it's just there's so much going on right now that is how hard they have time to sit.

But it turns out I did have time to sit.

I don't think so.

We're just here.

We're just shooting the shit.

Gentlemen, have you not checked in with the news?

No, I think we were just going to try and figure out which is better, a Twix bar or a take five.

Oh, the MOSBA.

But the new gentlemen, the urgent news.

Urgent news of what?

What is it?

Queen Elizabeth II.

Sovereign of all great Britain has been declared dead at the Castle Bell moral in Scotland.

Wow.

Oh, no.

Are they continuing?

See, I'm not finished informing you Prince Charles of Wales has ascended to the throne of England.

He shall now be styled as King Charles the third.

That's all.

He's on that shoe.

How?

For you, Byron Dennis and Royal watcher.

This is like huge news to you.

It's I give what's tremendous.

Do we care?

I can't believe.

I mean, I could go back to Twix versus take five.

But this seems important.

So yeah, I don't understand what you're even I suppose you did not just tell me.

I'm talking about Queen Elizabeth, the Queen of all England.

Yeah, we know her.

She's been around for like 96 years or something.

96 years.

Precise.

She was in.

Is that 96 years?

Keep going to the singing part.

No, that's the only part.

I like the keyboard part.

Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

I can't believe the two of you can can banter about trivialities on such a momentous day as this.

Do you suspect foul play?

I know.

I don't really jump into it.

No, no, no, no, no.

There's much more of foot than that gentleman far more.

Yes, the Queen has been declared dead about more.

Well, look, I mean, it's not like that has any effect on our lives.

Like if someone like Ken Star will, you know, will ever die, which I doubt he ever will.

Ken Star, the special prosecutor.

Or did he just die?

No, he'll never die.

Oh, he's immortal.

Yeah, this is of course September the sixth.

The eighth, I thought you said.

Yes, that's right.

Wait, is it the sixth?

Do we know something in advance?

I believe Ken Star will die on Tuesday September 13th.

No, I believe he will.

No, we're not in the.

This isn't that kind of show where we prognosticate about the future deaths of people.

But if you're right, is this a ripple effect kind of thing?

That could be a show.

The biop and dentist in predicts your death.

It's not a bad idea.

Not a bad idea at all.

Is this a ripple effect where the Queen's death will then cause deaths upon deaths upon deaths?

Look, here's the first thing I need to show you.

First of all, I've just come from England.

Wait, how did you get here so fast?

Just today?

This is what happened.

Yes.

This is the Phil Collins Concord.

The Farturvity's gentleman.

But when the Queen was declared dead, I knew that Harry and Meghan would be in Europe there to attend the festivities.

And I thought this is a perfect time to break into their home and, well, to go to the house to be on the estate of Montecito to just see to some things I need to do there.

But wilds in England, specifically at Balmoral Castle, I became privy to various plans and things and all sorts of things that I can exclusively report to you.

Wow.

Yeah.

Okay, so you witnessed the Queen's death?

Is that what you're trying to say?

No, no, no, I was there right when they decided that today would be the day that they said that she died.

Oh, whoa.

Yes indeed.

So does that mean are you insinuating that she is alive and we're just being told she's dead?

Or that she died previously?

I am not insinuating.

I am reporting that Queen Elizabeth is alive and will.

What?

Just like Ken Starr?

Yes, just like Ken Starr, although he will die on the 13th.

I doubt it.

But if he does, my God, Queen Elizabeth is my wedding anniversary.

Queen Elizabeth isn't.

Is it really?

Yeah.

I wouldn't want to celebrate two things.

Happy anniversary in advance.

It's frequently on a Friday, I imagine.

Well, sure.

Here's what happened.

Do you remember the last time?

The teens have been happy.

Lucky days, isn't it?

Terrible day to have an anniversary.

But it was a Saturday when it happened to us.

Yes, yes.

But some of the anniversaries will be Fridays.

When it happened to us, a lot of people like having their marriage described as having had something happened to them upon us.

The last time I was here, I reported that the Queen had a plan to blow herself up on a throne rigged with dynamite on June 5th, the final day of her platinum jubilee.

That's right.

Oh, yeah, and I was going to have you back on the show and we ended up not having you on the show because it didn't happen.

It didn't happen.

And also you dragged.

Wait, did you fight to the death?

Didn't you drown in Scott's pool?

No, no, no, no.

Well, yes.

I only pretended to drown, gentlemen.

Oh, that was pretend.

Why did you pretend to drown?

Because I thought it was very unfair that I should be pitted against a polo instructor, a water polo instructor in a game of water polo without any time to prepare and train for the game.

And so I felt it was very unfair.

So you just drowned right away?

No, I did not.

I said, why did I pretend to drown?

I took a big grommette on my hands.

I mean, you were taken out on a stretcher in a body bag.

Yes, I know.

It was very uncomfortable.

Paramedics came declared you.

Were these fake paramedics?

Yeah, well, yes, I spoke.

Or these were bad ones anyway.

I think they were just incompetent.

It could be both.

They just did load you into a replica of the Ghostbusters.

The ectomobile.

Thank you.

Yeah.

Listen, I really don't know.

I couldn't get the actual.

You couldn't.

All I do.

You called them.

Didn't you call them?

I only appeared to drown.

But now I'm realizing you routed my phone to a fake 911 number.

Just so you could have actors come in to clear you dead, only to come in today as if none of that happened.

And to be talking about the queen dying as if that's the major news when we should be talking about you being alive.

You producing an incredible proof of death scenario?

Dan Aykroyd is a dear friend.

I get a hold of him any time.

Wait, was that him as one of them?

You didn't recognize Dan Aykroyd as one of them?

No.

Oh, he has a gold.

Oh, man.

That's why he's an Oscar nominee.

That's why there was so much blues music coming out of that ectomobile.

Yes, there was.

There certainly was.

And all the IV bags they were trying to hook you up to were shaped like crystal skulls.

Like his vodka brand.

Yes.

And he was covered in badges.

That's right.

Dan Aykroyd loves a bag.

He kept screaming.

We don't need no stinking badges.

I know.

But yes, so that's that's I mean we both mourned you.

Oh, yeah.

Well, Scott, well, we're in the studio today.

But if we went to Scott's backyard, there is a headstone for you that he put it.

Really erected.

Yeah.

That's very nice.

What does it say something very touching and lovely on the.

No, I mean, we couldn't remember.

It says Byron British guy died here.

Yeah.

And also it's one of those Halloween ones that you buy at the Halloween Superstore made of styrofoam.

Yeah.

I see.

So it just says David has pumpkins.

OK, well, that not being my name.

It really doesn't seem to me.

Yes.

All right.

I just thought it was funny.

But we did place it right there at the spot where you drowned.

Yeah.

You have a styrofoam.

Great stone floating around your.

Yes.

It's 10 feet.

How come there aren't more styrofoam floaties in pools that are the shape of gravest?

Yes, there should be.

Good question.

Well, anyway, welcome back.

Yes.

Thank you.

It's good to be here.

Yes.

You say the queen died?

Sorry.

What?

No, she isn't dead.

The queen is dead.

Smith.

This is what happened.

No.

No, she was going to blow herself up on the fifth.

But she found that her nemesis King Harold the fifth of Norway had constructed a throne.

Remember, she was going to blow up the throne of England and whoever got a throne first to the throne of the king of the king of the king would become the king.

And she learned that King Harold, who she despises, had built a throne and hidden it someone bucking in palace.

And so she said, well, let's scrap it.

We'll scrap the whole plan.

So that was all scrapped.

And then now she's just been carrying on living with, you know, Jim Broadbent and Jim Belushi, her two husbands and feelings.

Wait, hold on.

Did we talk about this?

Oh, yes.

She's been in according to Jim's scenario.

Oh, that's right.

Yeah, I forgot.

It's in according to Jim Throuple.

It's a Throuple and it's a, it's a good, far more trouble than it's worth.

And so she simply decided she was done with the drama.

So she went to fake her own death.

She has faked her own death.

And it's, I know a guy who could have helped her with this.

Who does that?

This guy Al, that I know.

Oh, really?

Yeah, he fakes people's death all the time.

Well, maybe she did use Al.

I have no idea.

Wait, Olivia is her entire body shaved other than her anus.

I don't think we can ask that about the day deceased queen.

No, you can't answer that.

But give me a little nod if that's the truth.

Well, okay.

So maybe I'll have something to do with it.

Perhaps.

But also, so it was a long range plan that she and her dear friends, Ivana Trump and Olivia Newton John and Mikhail Gorbachev, they called themselves the richest with bitches.

And they've all recently passed.

It was reported, indeed, allegedly, none of them.

Trump has one of those David S. pumpkin's headstones in his golf course, I believe.

Just like, it's just full of documents.

It's for Ivana.

But yes, anyway, they're all yachting around the world, having the time of their lives.

So you're saying that Olivia Newton John has faked her own death.

The same way that her ex-husband faked his own death.

Yes, exactly.

There are a double death figure couple.

So that he could go right around on a sale of a yacht.

That's right.

Well, that's where the idea came from.

She said, you know what my husband did to get out of paying someone $10,000 when she the queen.

That was the $10,000?

Apparently.

She doesn't have that light around in her dresser?

I guess not.

He had debts of $10,000 and said, I'm faking my debt.

But they're back together now, Olivia and her husband, you know, because when you...

Now they're on the run.

They're both on the run, having faked their debts.

And they're all just having the time of their lives.

Well, that's...

I mean, what are they up to?

They're on a yacht.

You say they're yachting around?

Yes, they're yachting around.

They never touch land.

No, they only touch land on clothing optional beaches from mine.

Wow.

Seriously.

You would think that would be where they are most recognizable.

You can see most of them.

I mean, you could see all of them.

You were unable to cover themselves in any way, shape or form.

The idea is no one's looking at their faces, gentlemen.

Oh, I do.

I mean, Michael Gorbachev especially has a very distinguishable...

Do you think he has the same mark on his penis in the exact same place?

Yes, it's on both heads.

He's a both heads guy.

Yeah.

Well, I wouldn't know.

But...

Yes, there...

This is insanity.

Well, it's the truth and it's what I heard just last week and I thought, well, you know what?

As long as this is going down.

So this has been in the works for a week.

It's been in the works for an entire week.

Oh, so you weren't shocked with today's news.

This was just...

Oh, because you...

You heard that they were going to announce that.

I hope they were going to do it, but I didn't know exactly when.

But I thought, well, if it's coming off soon, let me get back to California so I can get into...

So it took you a week to get back here.

Well, I took the Phil Collins Concorde.

Oh, yeah.

And it stops off at every live aid city.

Yes, it has a lot of stops.

Philadelphia, London.

Just...

There's those two.

Yeah.

But they take a really long layover.

Why Philadelphia?

Well, yeah.

Why was it in Philadelphia?

America because of the Liberty Bill?

I guess, yeah.

The last soul music too.

They, you know, that was what they were trying to distinguish the soul.

Do you think they were trying to...

Yeah, like that's what they were trying to...

Well, they...

In we are the world, they were famously very upset that the English people got to this first because it's an African problem.

And they're like, why did all these white English people, you know, like steal our thunder?

And so maybe it had something to do with that.

They also left their egos at the door.

Oh, well.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

They were also inspired to write a decent song, unlike the Americans.

But let me say...

Okay, couldn't quite tell who you were slamming.

Oh, right.

Maybe they stopped in Philadelphia just to like refuel the plane and Bob was like, I got to gelled off.

Oh, my...

Interesting.

And did you...

Was Gildoff?

Sir Bob.

Was he on this plane?

SVG.

Yes, sir, Bob.

Yes, he was with me.

Yeah.

First to let you know what I've been up to, by the way, I have been...

Did we ask that?

No.

I have been aggressively wooing Lady Amelia Spencer because...

Still.

You remember in that Pono match in the pool, I was competing against the Gris, you know?

Right.

And I pretended to drown.

Who is a professional or a celebrated water poli?

Yeah.

And this was to the death in whoever won would get to woo Lady Amelia, is that right?

Yes, that's right.

And we have been told that nobody beats the Gris.

Yeah.

And we've lost you both drowned.

Evidently, yes, we both drowned.

Well, but I was only pretending, but he really did.

And so now I...

We had a separate bunch of paramedics come for him.

Well, well, yeah, Zachroid wasn't good to take away the Gris.

He was part of the...

It was very strange that first paramedics came and only looked at, treated, bagged and left with you.

And we said, what about this guy?

And they said, that's not our problem.

We're like, okay, do we need to call 911 again?

Yeah.

Yeah, sure.

911 again, and now I'm realizing this must have been the real 911, and they came and got the Gris.

Yes.

So his unfortunately passed away.

He has unfortunately, yes, passed away.

So this is...

Unfortunately, not really.

Because, you know, I now have free reign to woo Lady Amelia.

It has cleared the claim.

So, for months now, have you just been exclusively able to kind of pitch woo?

Yeah, well, you know, but in my sort of subtle way, you know, I've been watching her.

Well, I've been watching her.

I've been getting close, you know.

So you've been figuring out her likes, her dislikes in order to...

Yes, it's like a classic romantic comedy.

When I approach her, I want to be able to...

Do you ever see Fisher King?

I want to be able to deliver a classic romantic comedy.

Classic romantic comedy.

Who are you in this, the Michael Jeter?

No.

No, no, no.

Robert Williams, isn't he mentally ill in this?

Yes.

Okay.

But he also delivers a stirring monologue where he has observed every single behavior of this woman that he loves.

Lydia?

Oh, Lydia.

You seem, Lydia?

He has.

I'm Amanda Plummer.

Perhaps, maybe.

But I heard that she's not a Plummer.

She's an actress.

Good point.

Well, well said.

Thank you.

And well argued.

Case closed.

Well, I'm prepared.

I'm prepared to...

I know in the past, Byron, you have wooed...

You tried wooing people by dressing up as other people.

Yes.

So, with Lady Amelia, are you attempting to woo her as herself?

Are you doing this from afar, or are you doing it from a near?

Or are you having to put on a performance?

Yeah, are you doing sort of a Nathan Fielder rehearsal kind of thing where you're trying it out as other characters first, like to see what she likes, what she responds to?

I don't know the reference.

But I do...

Yes, there's a very good chance that what I will end up doing is dressing up as and inhabiting the Grizz, because she believes herself to be engaged to him.

Wow.

So she doesn't know that she's not a lister.

She doesn't know that Grizz died?

The Grizz has a tendency to go away on long trips.

Oh.

Well, I mean...

Well, he calls water polo.

Yeah.

Water polo famously, you're on the road so much of the year.

I suppose.

Or in the water, rather.

In the water.

You can't bring your phone in the water.

Yeah.

You're on the road.

That's what's the good...

Right.

So I may...

Sorry, I couldn't text you.

I was in the water.

Yeah.

Folks don't work them.

Yeah.

So I don't know if she thinks he's dead or a lot, but either way, if the Grizz shows up on her doorstep, but it would really be me.

You know, that would be good.

Or...

If I think I can pull it off as myself, I may...

Because you're quite a bit...

Yeah, can you lift up your shirt?

I don't know that you can pull off the Grizz.

Yeah, he is.

He's quite a bit older than him.

Well, yes.

And you also sound very different.

Oh, dude.

I won't by the time I get...

Oh, can you give us a little grin?

Yeah.

Yes, it's me.

I'm the Grizz in all that.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yes, here I am, the Grizz.

Well, let's see your abs.

Let's see what you got here.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, no.

Those are now.

Those are like reverse abs.

They're concave.

Yes, they're going...

You're going to have to...

Nobody...

I mean, no offense, Byron, but nobody is going to believe that you are a competitive water polo.

Oh, really?

Or coach or any of that.

Have you even been trying water polo?

Have you been competing at all?

Since you...

Trade in it?

Well, no, no.

I had that one terrible experience and I've been very terrified of water to assist.

So you and Dan Aykroyd have not been playing water polo.

That's each other.

No, no, no.

Aykroyd and I aren't handball.

Oh, you're a handball couple of hands.

Do you wear the glove?

Oh, yes.

Bear handed.

No, I wear the glove.

Oh, yes.

It's all about the glove for me.

I have a collection of gloves.

You have a collection of...

These aren't Michael Jackson gloves, are they?

No, do you have Michael Jackson gloves?

He was the king of pop, by the way, so you're a royal watcher.

Yes, yes, yes.

I have his glove.

Were you watching him all the time?

Him and Conrad Murray?

And if so, why didn't you say something?

I assumed Conrad Murray knew what he was doing.

He was a doctor.

Yes, I saw him pop out to make a few phone calls and I did think for a moment.

I think he left a man with it.

Well, all right.

But I guess I wish I'd said something, of course.

But I don't...

You know, a journalist doesn't put himself in the story.

That's true.

That's a good point.

So how have you been getting to know Lady Amelia's likes and dislikes?

Well, I really live within her walls.

Literally, not figuratively.

Oh, right.

Yes, literally.

Yes.

Are there passageways there or is this just...

I had to build them.

I had to build various passageways and shoots and things like that.

How are you...

Because normal walls only have like a tiny bit of space in between them in the next room.

Are you like building out like fake closets and stuff like that?

I have purchased the residences on either side.

She lives in...

She lives in the townhouse in London.

Exclusive area in London.

You must have spent quite a bit of money.

A fortune, yes.

It's one of the most posh areas of London.

Wow.

But you've spent no money working with a dialect coach to sound more like the Grids.

Well, it wasn't necessary.

Or you've spent no money on a physical trainer to look more like...

No, I've spent an enormous amount of money on a physical chair.

Oh, just to look like this?

Yes.

Oh, dear.

Okay.

All right, well...

For what you're telling me, it sounds like it may not have paid all.

You need more work.

Well...

I didn't know this guy's good.

Who knows what you would look like about?

You're in middle-aged British guy shape.

Which is...

Thank you.

Not a compliment.

So wait, so...

Personal trainers in Britain make you look like that?

Oh, this guy's shredded for middle-aged British.

Oh, okay.

Oh, my God.

He went the full Gambon.

Yes, this is the one...

This is the full Monty.

If you're in London, if you're in the UK, Gambon's doing cross-fit commercials.

Yes.

I have Colin Firths, man.

Yeah.

Gambon Firth.

Wow.

So the full Monty, in other words, was not a charming movie about a bunch of overweight people taking their clothes off.

It was an actual depiction of what people look like in Britain.

Oh, people were very turned on by the African women.

So this is a pornographic film in Britain?

Yes, yes.

It was in the UK.

It has a different title.

It's called Jacked Dudes.

Jacked two dudes.

Yes, people love that.

Jacked two.

Was that a Broadway musical?

Did that make the album Broadway?

I think it was.

Yeah, it's a great one.

Of course.

You're delighted by it.

Was it?

What a good idea.

What a lovely gig.

Well, this is great, Byron.

I'm so happy that you're able to unimpeded go after Lady Amelia because I think, you know, the two of you are a great couple and the gris is out of the pictures.

I'm madly in love with her.

I'm madly.

What's that say?

Sorry, is that my stomach?

I don't know.

You do. You did say beforehand that you were starving.

What is that sound?

Look out, Bill!

What?

Well, well, well.

No, this could be.

Byron Daddistan as I live and breathe.

You see, that's just a little bit nice.

Just what?

What are you doing?

Is this your dialect coach who is this?

I'm afraid gentleman.

I'm afraid.

This is the gris.

Obviously, this is the gris.

The gris is dead.

I came down through the sprinklers, didn't I?

Yeah.

You heard him say, look out below.

Right.

And then he simply appeared, but yes, now I see you somehow false yourself through the sprinkler system.

I can fit through any pipe or drain.

There are water polar bears.

There are so many characters stuck in the walls of this building.

I thought you died, Gris.

What happened?

Of course you did.

We called the paramedics.

It's what I wanted you to think.

What we grieved is what you don't know about the gris is.

What?

I think you could catch race too by the way.

What you don't know about the gris is.

Izz.

In a tiny pocket in my swimming costume, I keep a watertight capsule and in that capsule is one of those sponges.

What were you adding water to it?

It expands.

What?

And that little spot.

I'm getting even bigger.

When are you going to be done?

I can't keep the stuff.

The whole spot is shaped exactly like me, the grids.

In case I have to fate my own death.

So what I did was I released a sponge from the capsule and I swim through the drain in the pool.

What?

I can't.

I've spent so much time in swimming pools, I can flatten my body to fit through the drain and the filter if need be.

Wow.

So we wanted elaborate deathfaking plan.

I only called Dan Akrud.

Well, I mean we called the paramedics.

You fake evidence sponges more elaborate than calling Dan Akrud.

How did it bring the acto mobile around?

You watched this?

Of course I did.

Where were you?

From the pipes?

Pipes?

I was in a grate.

You were in a grate.

A little ways away.

Anyways, Kyle.

I don't like that comparison.

Sorry, sorry.

You're not a petty one.

I try not to appear in grapes.

Sometimes it can't be helped.

Why are you carrying this red balloon, by the way?

I just come from a carnival.

Okay, see, this is not helping your Pennywise thing.

Look, this is incredible.

You're still alive, but we need to take a break.

We're going to sort all of this out.

This is horrible.

This is really bad for you, Byron.

Take your break.

I'm not bothered.

But we need to take a break.

We'll sort this all out on the other side.

Boy, this is incredible.

Who is the greatest?

The Grizz!

We'll be right back with more Jason Manzukas, more Byron Dennis, and more Grizz will be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang after this!

Oh, the Grizz.

Comedy Bang Bang Bang, we're back.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

Zukas is making fun of my cadence, and we are here with, of course, Byron Dennis- Yes.

Who has taken the break.

He's just been alternating between like he's texting someone on the phone.

He's been crying.

Also, he came here and delivered truly shocking news.

Come here with an oubus amount of news, yes.

Although the news we've heard from you has not been as shocking as the news that you're both still alive, I have to say.

But it's embarrassing.

Yes.

For our personal experience, this is two people we knew.

Yeah, we know you guys.

We've never met the queen.

We mourned you.

We sang lamentations over your gravestones for the cool.

We sang like a nice Irish sort of- Say God Me, a very nice styrofoam gramestone, put it in the pool.

That's how much they care about- Oh, we got one for him too.

What does mine say?

The Grizz.

Thank you.

It says David S. Pumpkins, and we cross it out and put Grizz.

Well, I thank you for the close.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no.

The only ones they sell say David S. Pumpkins.

And they have a picture of Tom Hanks and Bobby Moynihan.

What about Mikey Day?

They didn't know who he was.

They excluded Mikey Day.

Well, we did.

The styrofoam gramestone, people don't know Mikey.

Yes.

Well, they don't know him.

They don't make anything like that, but one of the gravestones we got was cake.

Yeah.

Mmm.

So we disintegrated.

That was yours, unfortunately.

Oh, really?

I'm so sorry.

Well, I'd have appreciated eating it.

Yeah.

Well, we thought you were dead.

This time, don't tell us you're dead.

We don't make us feel guilty.

We didn't let you eat your own grave cake.

Next time you buy me a gravestone that's actually cake, hang on to it for a few months to find out if I really did.

Yes, do let, do let old Baron Dennis then have his tea and cakes.

All right, Gris.

Feed it into his toothless old mouth.

I've got three of these all real teeth.

Gris, I'm curious as someone who is in...

No, Dad.

Let's say you are me, old son.

Inside of this event, how is news of the Queen's alleged death?

Yeah, are you here to tell us that the Queen is dead?

I've got some news.

I've already broken the big news, Gris.

As a royal watcher.

I'm sure you think you have.

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, because he broke two newses, one that the Queen was dead.

Had been declared dead.

Had been declared dead and one that the Queen is still alive and on nudist beaches.

Well, he's right.

The Queen has been declared dead.

Wow.

Because she is.

What do you mean by that?

The copy.

Operation Double Decoy was a smashing success.

Double Decks?

Whoa.

Let me get a gander at these.

The Queen, what you fake, fight their own death.

She's in actuality.

A double.

What do you mean I heard her discussing it with her highest advisors?

Did you or did you hear two tape recorders talking to each other?

You fool, Barry Deniston.

You fell for the old two tape recorders talking to each other.

Wait, did you not see a physical person talking to each other?

A person talking to you just hear tape recorders?

Wait, were they push brooms with coats on them?

With tape recorders hanging off the handle.

Two mops with their edge cut to look like the Queen.

Now, to the Queen's haircut.

Most British people do look like mops.

That is true.

You gotta look like a mop.

No, I don't at all.

Do not use me to clean the floor.

Look, I...

Tell me Boris Johnson upside down wouldn't do a great job cleaning your floor.

That is a good point.

That is fair.

I mean, all time Hugh Grant?

You could fucking...

Oh, time Hugh Grant.

Yeah, with that floppy mopby hair.

Blowjob lover?

Hugh Grant.

Is that how we identify him?

He loves him.

He's a...

Blaujo-Bafissiano, though.

How many people do you know who would not characterize themselves as Blaujo-Bover?

He's the only one we know for sure.

No, Tori's Blaujo-Hater Scott Ocherman.

What was he thinking, gentlemen?

Yeah?

Oh, my God.

Hey, how are you thinking?

Now, then, wait a minute, wait.

Yes, I...

As a royal watcher, you know, I'm in and out of Buckingham Palace all the time in various disguises and things, you know?

And on the particular day that they were talking about the Queen's very elaborate plans to fake her death and sail around the world with the others.

Yes, I was in the chimney. I was in the chimney, just sort of pretending to be a log.

Oh, it's a bunch of logs.

Too bad you were in the firebox.

Dressed up as a bundle of logs.

You should have been peeping through a portrait, Byron, because you've missed some key detail.

Well, logs don't have eyes, you see, so I needed to keep my eyes closed.

So you don't know if it was just mops with tape recorder?

I didn't see this. I only heard it, but it was absolutely the Queen and her...

I read that as in royal listener.

He's up in times, if I'm dressed up as something that doesn't have eyes, I can't watch!

You painted your eyelids brown? Not brown, but you know, sort of put a grain on the muno.

Oh, I see.

I am just now noticing that you appear to be covered in burns.

Where do they light the logs?

Is there any chance that they tried to light a fire?

I happen to have an excellent bundle of logs costume, and yes, it does have the downside of occasionally being set on fire.

When you are hiding in a firebox, and then it's a real challenge to stay still.

And not scream out in pain.

Yes, and not open your eyes.

But yes, part of it is painting my eyelids.

I mean, it's quite a performance to give off warmth and comfort of a fire while you are burning to death.

Yes, thank you, yeah.

Don't worry, Byron, soon the job will be complete.

What do you mean the job will be?

You're gonna burn it all.

You'll never have to worry about opening your eyes ever again.

Oh, that's a threat.

It is an implied and explicit threat.

What are you saying?

You're going to kill me.

Not that I'm going to do it, but you will be killed.

Nonsense.

Now, let me try to understand this.

You're saying that I was meant to over here that the Queen was planning to fake her death and sail around the world.

Because she knew she was going to die in the next week?

Was I the only one that was meant to be deceived?

Thrown off the scent, yeah.

Yes.

Just me.

Just you.

But why?

Because it amuses my fiance, Lady Amelia.

No, she knows about Byron.

Of course she does.

She's a listener.

Lady Amelia was part of this.

You?

It was her idea.

She's trying to make a fool of me by getting to go out and report exclusives that aren't true.

Every royal monarch is able to choose her own death day.

Oh, so she chose it?

She knew she would die.

It was her idea, the Queen.

Really?

I mean, I believe that.

You know, there is a way in which to have that much power, wouldn't you want to conquer death if, what wouldn't you want to say I get to choose when I do it if you don't?

It's divine right in here.

There you go.

So she died today.

I mean, you know, when this is coming out.

As she chose.

You know, and she can, I'm no doubt she's going to watch all of the, all of the, you know, celebrations or not celebrations, but you know, all the morning, all the, all the events she gets to watch and hear all the nice things that are said about her.

Wait, what do you mean she's dead?

She's dead.

But she's dead.

Oh, I'm sorry.

The grizz is saying she is dead.

I put the grizz is saying.

Welcome back to the operation double decoy.

So lady, lady Amelia, this chap, what's name is a gravy digger.

And she said, he specializes in making doubles of famous people.

I met him, I think.

Did I?

Did you really?

I think I met him in San Antonio.

Is that maybe you met him in a dream.

It might have been a dream.

It feels like a dream.

So the queen was doubled.

Yeah.

Oh, yes, doubled and then employed a fake your own death situation where she shaved her entire body, the double shaved her entire body, save for their and her anus.

So this is where my confusion lies.

Are both the queen and the queen's double now dead?

Both are dead.

The queen is dead.

The double yet lives.

The double is on nudist speeches.

So the double is on nudist speeches.

The double is on nudged beaches.

They're all doubles too.

That's right.

This was all done so that I would come here and report an erroneous exclusive for about ten minutes before you showed up.

And that the story?

Amelia, yourself once again.

And the story is that a word.

Essentially a group of celebrity impersonators are going to nude beaches.

Bad plan, Gris.

Who's funding this?

This is outrageous.

Why is it a bad plan?

It worked.

He looks like a right book.

To what end though?

Like he had about ten minutes of work.

This was the end.

Would you do me a favor and not air the first deck please?

Yeah, I just won't put this out.

I just won't put this out.

It's not to be true.

Oh, you'll put it out, Sonny Jim.

Oh shit.

Oh, you'll feel the wrath of the Gris.

Why didn't they just double Prince Andrew and get rid of that turkey?

Oh, oh.

Is Prince Andrew not real?

Prince Andrew, no, they're on the- Is he still on Epstein Island?

They're on the seventh Prince Andrew.

They're all telling not to be.

They're all creable.

Yes, that's true.

There's something about Prince Andrew that whoever assumes that role becomes that.

Something about that job.

It's like Santa Claus, the Prince Andrew clause.

Because that's when he crepe.

It's the clothes they're on did.

All of Prince Andrew's clothes are on did.

I believe that.

Did you call him a sweaty creep?

Yeah.

That's exactly wrong.

He can't perspire.

That's true.

He's not removable to perspiring.

It's bullman.

Bullman.

Poor man.

Well, this is terrible, Byron.

You've made it right full of yourself.

A wrong fool.

Yes, I'm afraid I have, but even worse than that gentleman.

The Queen is dead.

I'm so sorry for your loss.

We don't care, but I'm sorry for your loss.

The thought of her frolicing on nude beaches with Mikhail Gorbachev and Olivia Newton John and Ivana Trump was a soothing balm to my spirit.

All this time.

Terrible.

I'm sorry for that, but Amelia.

Amelia Spencer is evidently still with the gris and making plots against me to make a fool of you.

Yeah.

You have nothing, Byron.

I have suffered numerous reversals here today.

After you had tried to impersonate me later in the evening, she'd go whisper to me in the toilet.

You were just saying that.

And we laugh and laugh.

Why are you in the toilet?

I was hidden.

Because he's hidden in the pipes.

He's hidden in the pipes.

I know you.

He was in it.

He's in a Danny Boy scenario.

Oh, she still loves you when you have been the water in her toilet.

Oh, is that what you've been in?

I don't transform into water.

He's not changing.

You're like a regular moaning murder.

It's just the best place to hear.

It's got the best acoustics.

You're in the toilet.

I'm just below.

Just below the surface.

Right where the shit goes.

You don't know anything about raw people, do you?

Oh, they don't do that?

Oh, Lady Amelia certainly doesn't certainly not.

Never.

That's one of the reasons I want to marry into a royal family so I can stop shitting.

More than anything.

It happened to me once we got engaged.

Really?

It's wonderful.

Where does it go?

Don't know.

Just apparate.

All I know is it's gone.

Byron, you have less than enough.

This is at this point.

Terrible day for you.

You're less than nothing.

Your entire life's work is gone.

You'll have to start watching King Charles III now.

Oh, God.

How awful.

He can't even use a pen.

Maybe you can be reincarnated as a tampon and be near him.

Or something like this.

His wife's medicine cabinet.

Right.

Well, yes, that's what's going to happen to him when he dies, right?

He's going to come back and come to the plot.

That's what he won't do.

That's his hope.

Good.

He's fun this wish.

Yes, and Andrew's the creep.

Yeah.

I mean, you could watch those guys, I guess.

Not only that, but now you have no prospects for taking off in the royal spaceship.

Oh, God.

Do you feel as though there will be the same kind of fervor and excitement to cover and watch Prince Charles?

What did you say?

The third.

King Charles.

The third.

Lord, Legion, solvable.

You're kind of getting into it now.

You just perked up really.

It is exciting, as you do.

You have a king.

Yes, a king.

Yeah.

Yeah, it's fine.

They have a 70.

It's feeling very like a game of thrones, even the castle where the queen died sounds like it's a location in Game of Thrones.

Balmorals?

Yeah.

Balmorals.

Or it sounds like Lord of the Rings.

There's a Balrog there.

There is a Balrog though.

She doesn't Scotland.

She died in Scotland.

She's queen?

That's weird.

You shall not pass before she did.

She said I shall not pass.

And then she did.

And then she did, yes.

What she meant was because she's a royal, she would not pass water.

Oh, I see.

Right.

Those are great last words.

Yes, yes.

Well, there's an ancient clause in the agreement between Scotland and England that if the queen dies in England, Scotland will never be independent.

Oh, so she'd chose to die in Scotland.

I heard her final words were Kurt Russell.

Why?

I don't know.

A lot of very highly powerful people's final words are Kurt Russell.

Oh, yes.

Like Walt Disney.

She was trying to say Kurt Russell Terrier because that's a kind of dog she wanted instead of cool geez, but she was never allowed.

Oh, no.

By the way, wouldn't that be a great breed of dog the Kurt Russell Terrier?

Kurt Russell Terrier.

Who the hell was Jack Russell anyway?

Yeah.

Get out of here, Jack.

Where are those corgis?

It's a road.

The corgis have all been burnt.

No, actually, the corgis have gone into the care of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, his ex-wife, which is ex-wife.

Yeah, they've lived with whom he lives.

What?

He's ex-wife with benefits.

Yes, that's right.

They still live together.

And he's taken the dogs because he gave his mother the dogs with ex-gones brought the south for him.

So when you give a gift to a dead person, someone who ends up dying, you have to take the gift back?

I think the spirit was sort of like you gave her these fucking dogs and you take them.

There's a bit more like that.

Well, I'm glad you're getting excited about King Charles.

A bit, but you know what?

Also, I'll always have Meghan Markle, won't I?

I guess, although, is she going to stop her podcast out of respect for the Queen?

No, why would she?

No.

What she did?

Are you just finding this out?

Just putting it on.

Wait a minute.

Meghan Markle will stop the podcast.

See, I'm a podcast watcher.

So I'm out there in the walls watching Conan O'Brien, you know, watching the Office, ladies.

Meghan Markle had a podcast, Slammin' the Queen.

It was 90 minutes of trash talk every week.

It's Patreon only.

It's like a silly MMIN, a pastor of the Queen.

Of course I know the podcast.

I'm just shocked that she's not doing it anymore.

Well, she's putting it on pause.

She will, she'll return to it after all.

So they've ran out of set titles.

So what are you watching them anyway for Byron?

Yeah, they're not.

They're like Americans.

No, I...

Royal watcher Byron, that is in watching a married couple in Montecito.

One of whom used to be on suits.

Yes.

And deal or no deal.

I watch them all the time.

It suits us on a loop in my home.

A suits loop?

A suits loop in one of the bedrooms.

But you know, erm...

No, they are still the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

And now, the Queen is dead, their children have attained the style of prints and prints.

Okay, so you're just going to watch the kids from now on?

I think I may...

Well, yes.

I guess I'll watch the kids.

Maybe you've been around Prince Andrew for too long.

How are you going to get on the spaceship?

Yeah, that's the...

That's because the world's ending soon.

You need to get on this spaceship.

It's feeling increasingly more and more like the apocalypse is upon us.

Do you have a date for the...

For when the spaceship is taking off?

Oh, indeed I do.

And wouldn't you like to know it, Byron?

I've got to know.

Yes, I've got to know.

I need to be on that spaceship.

There's no room for you.

Oh no!

The spaceship's full mate!

Oh god, no.

Catch the next one.

What about...

You know, Princess?

Is there a next one?

Yeah, there will be.

Oh, okay.

Ladies and gentlemen...

I was just being cruel.

Lady Amelia has a twin.

She does.

Yeah, do it.

Do it all do.

So I'm going to...

I'm going to...

That's my plan now.

Byron, can you be this foolish?

What do you mean?

It's Lady Amelia in a wig!

Oh god damn it!

It's a royal prank!

Why are all the royal pranks targeting me?

Because you're a prick!

They have nothing else to do.

Well look, look, we have to take a break.

What a terrible day!

This is a terrible day for you.

We have to take a break though.

Yes.

I feel bad about this.

But can you guys stick around?

Because we still have a little more show to come.

Oh not bothered.

Alright, great.

The gris will be here Byron.

I want to come with a...

You pathetic wuss.

It certainly can't get worse.

Are you talking about Lady Marina Windsor?

No, Lady Liza spins around.

You're a wretch like something out of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

Oh that word rich.

She just can't stop using it in that book.

It's terrible.

It's an unreadable book.

Unreadable.

Really didn't realize we were going to get into Frankenstein slamming.

It's just tried to read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.

Oh thank you.

No just try it.

There's a movie over there.

I don't need to.

We'll be right back with...

Just one movie.

We'll be right back with more Jason Mandzugas.

More Byron Dennis and more gris.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang we're back.

Jason Mandzugas is here and our show has been Shanghai'd by...

What were you going to do?

What was the plan?

We're just going to talk about...

By the way I'm thrilled you guys came because Scott was genuinely uninterested in the show prior to your revival.

Yeah revival.

Revival.

We both did.

Literally.

Literally vibed.

Yeah and the gris is here in Byron Denniston and this is a bad day for Byron.

I mean this is a day that will live in infamy September 8th.

And also Byron very hard for you because you've put all this work into making styling yourself as the gris is replacement only to now just be like absolutely humiliated.

Yes frankly there's no really coming back.

To that I have been humiliated.

I've been made fool but during the break I've come up with a new plan.

Oh you got a new plan.

Yes.

Okay.

To get myself on the rocket.

I will be the eighth Prince Andrew.

You know how we're on the seventh.

Yes.

The Prince Andrew already.

Oh no no.

You were the Queen's husband.

You were Prince Philip.

I was for a time and the Scrooge gang and all that kind of stuff.

You can listen to previous episodes about it.

Yes.

But so you're going to do the Prince Andrew clause by killing the current Prince Andrew.

That's right.

Stepping into his clothes.

I mean this is a pretty, I mean how comfortable you being inside of a pretty hateful character.

Well I don't think I mind that.

Do you think it'll be a lateral move?

And also I'm concerned about the sweating.

Are you at all worried that they will not allow him on the spaceship?

He should be Prince Andrew's merely an alternate on the spacecraft.

He's not guaranteed.

Oh no.

An alternate for who?

John Goodman.

King Ralph.

John Goodman.

He's not that.

King Ralph.

What?

Oh okay.

The fictional royalty make it onto the spaceship.

There was enough, enough truth in the line of succession that was depicted in that film.

No!

That John Goodman.

Wow!

He's allowed on the spacecraft.

Unbelievable.

The surviving members of Queen.

Do they get onto the spaceship?

No.

Oh okay good.

That Freddy Mercury sure.

Oh wait, is he alive?

Yeah.

Freddy Mercury is still alive?

On another planet.

Oh oh oh oh ready.

He chose an early option.

He said, be me up Scott.

He has no intelligent life down here.

I thought that was just a funny t-shirt.

It is now.

Oh but based on his- Is that how he actually- Is that how that t-shirt came to be?

Yeah.

Those were his final words on Earth.

Should we start selling this t-shirt where it's Freddy Mercury with a big word balloon?

It's his be me up Scottie.

There's no intelligent life down here.

Yes.

Okay.

100%.

Alright.

And on the back it's Adam Scott's face saying what?

Well this is- I need another plan then.

If I mean if that one's not going to work, God- I really don't think you want to go through the rest of your life inside of- The man that is Prince Andrew.

He's just an old- Well yes, not if he's just an old- Is Sir Elton John to see get to go on the spaceship?

Mm-hmm.

He's a rocket man.

It's tricky with sirs and- You know what you do.

Good.

And my guess is, and I'm, I'm spitballing here, but my guess is Helen Merrin will get to go because she portrayed the queen.

Oh, in the crown?

Yeah.

I see, Merrin.

I see.

So perhaps Merrin Merrin.

I'm a spit old for me to- What about Matt Damon?

I mean, how old are you, Byron Dennis, Tim?

Like she and I are exactly the same thing.

What about Matt Damon because he was in that Mars movie?

Errr, the Mars movie.

You think anyone connected to space?

You think Tom Hanks because of all his space movies for dads by dads?

How about the cat from outer space, the old Disney film?

Sure, why not?

How about the four outer space nuts?

Who's on this?

Yes, we need to know who's going to be on the ship that way, and all I need to do is marry anyone who's going into space.

It's all the royal family.

All right.

Yes, good.

Yes.

Whoever the current Prime Minister is.

Does it include royal families, Spanish royal family, you know, like royal families from other countries?

Yeah, I think it does.

We talked about this before.

Yes, yes.

They have royalty.

Okay.

Yes.

All right.

They have a monarchy that also has a democratically elected Prime Minister or such.

They get to go.

No American presidents, regardless of the special relationship.

Sure.

That's fair.

So what's his name must be so upset that he's not a PM anymore?

Bored?

What's the name?

Bored Johnson.

That was a bunch of Yeltsin.

But Michael Sheen gets to go because he played Tony Blair twice.

Oh, two blares.

Two blares.

You're all right.

That's right.

If you play the Prime Minister twice in two different films, you get to go.

You also played Frost.

Jack Frost.

That's right.

He throws a bizarre.

Jack Frost meets Nixon.

So that means he pro-genically throws Richard Nixon.

Michael Keaton also gets to go.

Because he played Jack Frost.

And Martin Short.

Right.

Martin Short.

What was he?

You were about to say.

I really was.

I really wanted to say.

So now the holiday classes.

Listen, I'm looking through my list of, OK, Princess Elizabeth Belgium.

She's available.

Is she about how old is she?

Princess Elizabeth of Thurn in Texas.

She's also available.

You know, of course I keep an updated list of available royals.

Right.

Princess Elizabeth of Belgium, you'd like to know how old she is?

Let's find out.

Hopefully she's a...

I can't do the perfect face.

What if you...

Firing work.

Did you update to iOS?

Succeeded, snout out yet.

It's not out yet.

Baron, why don't you...

Don't kill yourself.

I don't know what kind of...

Was that what you were going to say?

I was going to say that.

It's a bad solution.

I don't know what kind of resources you have.

But what if you were to buy, say for example, an unincorporated island in the ocean that is that no country claims.

You've done all of it.

Claimed it and declared yourself clean of that country.

Like King Roy of Sea Land.

Yes.

Could you then be considered royalty?

You can also buy that garbage island.

Garbage island.

The one that's just floating around from the...

Yeah.

And then call yourself the King of Garbage Island.

King of Garbage Island.

A fitting toy only found myself.

Well I might change the name.

King of...

Garbage...

Trash.

I don't know.

Who wouldn't be anything like that?

The King of Wonderful Island.

King of Refuse.

King of...

Yes.

But said sarcastically.

Beautiful forgotten items island.

Something like that.

Twenty years old is Princess Elizabeth.

Oh you're face the lit meld you're...

You're all the people.

Lit up in...

Duchess of Brabant.

You know what?

I'm going to take it back.

You should do Prince Andrew.

Yeah you're not.

No no he's only an alternate.

Alright I'm going to.

Here's...

Alright plan one.

See about marrying Princess Elizabeth of Belgium.

Okay.

Alright plan two.

First marrying Princess Elizabeth of Thurn in Texas.

Plan three.

Find the garbage island.

Name myself the king of it.

Come with a somewhat more suitable name and then...

Sort of bring the garbage island.

You have to bring the garbage island onto the spaceship?

No but I think...

No no.

I think it needs to be arguably in Europe.

You know what I mean?

Oh I see.

So that I am a king of Europe.

Where do you think it is now?

I don't know.

Does anyone know?

I...

The man that might know.

He's here on Thursdays I think.

He would know?

Yeah he's here on Thursdays.

If I were you.

I think twice about proclaiming myself king of anything that floats firing.

Why?

What does that mean?

Because the water is the domain of the Gris.

Oh no.

You think I've never placed salt water water polo?

I mean he floats even more in salt water.

You just call it salt water polo.

Salt water water polo.

It's like salt water water taffy.

Have you had it?

It's delicious.

Wonderful.

Can you move through salt water taffy?

Because well drinkable taffy.

If it's unwrapped.

Otherwise you're trapped by the wrapping.

It's the one way to trap me.

You should have just said that to the bottom.

The bunch did wax paper that surrounds salt water taffy.

So you've now admitted your single weakness.

Well where do we feel?

Well I've admitted it to the weakest man possible.

Barren that is done.

Do you think you could pick up salt water taffy wrapping?

Well it's going to have to be large.

You know a very large piece of wax paper.

And my feeling genuinely is that I don't think you, Byron, no offense, are in any shape to trap the Gris inside salt water taffy wrap.

If you just wrap it around him though.

He's right here next to you.

I know.

And you know that during the pandemic I was eating a ton of salt water taffy.

And I've just discarded the wrappers here in the studio.

Yes I see.

But how will I wrap on large men in a series?

Well I suppose I could tape them together couldn't I?

All you have to do is wrap them around and it traps them.

You just said it.

But you need a few minutes in that.

It's a bunch of small wrappers.

I'm picturing a large wrapper.

You need to be the one that can fit a jacked Gris.

What have I been taping in the middle?

Have you been taping in the middle?

Oh you've been taping it.

I shouldn't have been listening.

Oh my god.

Hey we're having a private conversation dude.

Sorry.

It is.

It's a gigantic sheet of salt water taffy wrapping papers.

This is like Samson.

You just have to cut off his hair.

Unbelievable.

Well, oh well here's some scissors.

No, no, no, no.

It's like Samson.

What?

It's a little like Samson maybe.

It's a bit of analogy.

Here's some scissors.

No I don't need no.

That won't help me.

But gentlemen, will you distract Gris?

Okay well.

Yeah, yeah.

Oh Gris.

Gris.

He was here.

I want to cut your hair.

Why?

He's been going to beauty school.

Yeah.

No.

My one weakness.

I twisted it in both hands.

Let me out.

Look at him there.

Let me out.

I'm worried that he's done.

Let me out.

I won't.

Oh my God.

He was a constant impenement to all of my plans and now he's wrapped up in a tank.

Wow.

This is incredible because the Gris for people who don't know is like a full grown, very athletic man.

Very athletic.

Which leads me to ask Scott, why are you eating so much salt water taffy to be able to stitch together a covering that can go around him and be twisted.

The pandemic was hard for a lot of us.

Hey, how you going?

Hey, Jimmy.

Hey, how you going?

Hey, wait, who's this?

Oh, wait.

Hey, how you going?

It's me, the Zerg.

Oh, the Zerg.

Yeah.

The inverse Gris.

The, uh, the counterpart from down under.

Talk to you.

Yeah.

The Australian Gris.

No, we never met before.

No, but I think we've talked maybe about you.

Oh, that's right.

Right.

Yes.

You're the Southern Hemisphere Gris.

That's right.

Yeah.

You're not even one, mate.

Yeah.

Hey.

You're a very nice competitor.

Welcome to the show.

This is comedy, bang, bang.

Oh, it's nice to be here.

Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, Zerg.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Paper Girls.

Yeah, Amazon Prime.

Please watch Paper Girls.

It's already been canceled.

Oh, all right.

I don't know.

How do I watch it if it's already been canceled?

It's on there.

You can watch it.

They keep the canceled.

It's on the BBC.

They keep the canceled stuff on there.

It's on Brit box.

Like a little gravestone.

Yeah.

There's a David S.

Pumpkin's, click on the David S.

Pumpkin's gravestone.

You can watch Paper Girls on Amazon Prime.

All right.

Yeah.

We're in the middle of a show.

Do you know the Queen?

Oh, sorry.

Your queen has died.

Your queen.

Well, you know, the Queen is still the Queen of Australia.

Yes.

No, I mean, you know, it's confusing, right?

Because she's, she's the Queen, but then we also got a sort of our own Queen Elizabeth down there.

What do you mean?

Well, you have your own Queen Elizabeth.

Everyone in the Northern Hemisphere has a counterpart down on that southern hemisphere.

Oh, I see.

It's like the toilet water moving counterclockwise.

Right.

Except for people.

Yeah, for people.

Yeah.

The people equivalent of toilet water moving can't come on.

Everybody in the southern hemisphere is a reverse version of their Northern Hemisphere counterpart.

Like S.

There's, there's, there's a Tox ochreman down there.

Yeah, there's a Tox ochreman.

Oh, how's he doing?

Oh, he's crying.

Okay.

Is there a Norib, Norib, not, not, not, didn't, didn't.

Nosten do?

An opposite bar in Denistan.

Right.

That's it.

Yeah.

So the, anyone we bring up there would be an opposite.

He's a, he's a royal ignorer.

Oh, wow.

So he just watches real people.

He refuses to know anything about the Rawls.

Oh, wow.

It's like a fool.

So you are the opposite of a water polo champion?

That's right.

What do you do?

I do.

Lance women.

What is that?

Get down on the ground.

Yeah, show you.

Oh, my God.

Wow.

Look at that.

He's, that's incredible.

I didn't know what it was until right now, but now I do.

It's really incredible.

He got right down on the ground and he swive him right down on the ground.

He swive him around.

Swive him around.

He is nuts.

He can't, he can't believe we saw that.

How have I, how have I gone?

I've been almost 50 years old and never seen someone land.

I went to Australia and I didn't see anyone land swimming.

Ah, you didn't go to the real one, mate.

I didn't go to the real Australia.

We got a fake one.

Is that weird land?

Everybody gets diverted.

Is that weird land?

Wow.

We're going to decoy Australia.

Yeah, we can't, we kind of have everyone going down there and seeing that counterpods.

Where does this make sense?

Where's it actually located?

In Australia, mate.

Oh, it's in Australia.

Yeah.

Okay.

So it's like a tiny like Disneyland almost?

Oh, I see what you mean.

Yeah.

No, Australia is in Australia, but the one you go to.

Yeah, where's that?

It's a, it's like right near Hawaii.

Oh, okay.

I wondered why that was so short.

Yeah, it's like seven hits.

But we drag you to make it seem like it's longer.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, everyone fell asleep on our plane.

No, the decoy Australia is a, it's a, it's 10 feet away from Hawaii.

Really?

10 nautical feet.

It's a regular mate.

All right.

Yeah.

Well, it's great talking to you.

Great talking to you.

Where are you here though?

Well, I got good news.

Oh, the, the opposite queen down the southern hemisphere?

Yeah.

Yes.

It's a mortal.

Wow.

Yeah.

Whoa.

As soon as the queen died, she got extra alive.

Oh my gosh.

You're kidding me.

Can I ask had she previously passed?

Oh, she'd been, she'd been dying for years.

But now she's the longest dying monarch.

We've ever had.

Wow.

Now she's alive forever.

Forever and ever mate.

This is great news.

That's extraordinary.

It is, isn't it?

Wow.

How exciting.

I'd like to go there.

I really would.

You went to Australia, you know, you should go to Byron Bay.

Oh, is that to place at Australia?

Yeah.

Byron Bay.

Yeah.

Well, that's in fake Australia.

From what I'm hearing.

Correct.

Right.

The decoy.

Yeah.

What's real Australia like?

It's tiny.

It's a tiny little place and it's got millions and millions of people in it.

Oh, that doesn't sound fun at all.

It's not.

So are you enjoying being here?

It's in Iraq.

Would you rather?

I'd rather have lots of space.

Yeah.

Really spread out of you.

Would you rather live in fake Australia?

Because it seemed pretty, you know.

Well, it's me own, you know, where I live.

Fake Australia?

Well, no, real awesome.

Oh, I see.

You're asking me if I want to live in the decoy.

Yeah.

I want to visit the decoy.

Sure.

You know, it was beautiful.

It's so long to get there though.

Right.

From where you are.

Old way to Hawaii, I suppose.

Old way to Hawaii and then 10 feet.

And then 10 feet.

10 feet.

It's that last 10 feet that really kill you.

Oh, you know.

And so many people end up just staying in Hawaii.

Right.

10 feet too far to jump, you know, not far enough to take a cab.

Plus you have to go through customs.

Right.

Can't swim there.

Right.

Yes, of course.

And now, Sir, how much water to swim?

Sir, are you a land swimmer?

I know you're a land swimmer, but are you also affiliated with the royal family?

Are you a royal family?

Oh, yeah.

Are you?

Okay.

Well, I got related into it, didn't I?

I became adopted by this young lady whose her name is...

Amelia.

And then, oh, lady, Amelia.

Lady, Amelia.

Yeah.

Rentspents.

Wow.

So you, you started...

She adopted me.

No, she adopted you.

Yeah, I was dating my own mother.

And then this lady adopted me.

Wow.

Good.

You know, is that just how it's done there?

Say what's done, mate?

And did you guys have a meet, cute, fall in love and then she just adopted you at first sight?

Me and me mother, yeah.

Oh, sorry.

Oh, I meant lady Amelia.

When I met my mother, it was very cute.

Yeah.

In the hospital, you know.

Yeah.

It's coming out of her body.

That's right.

But yeah.

Oh.

Who's...

Stop everything.

I don't think we can have even more people on the show.

Who is this?

It's me.

It's Norib.

Norib.

What do you mean, mate?

How are you going?

It's good to see you.

Look at it.

Norib.

I thought I could.

I can't really, though.

It's okay.

We found a weakness.

I think if you stick with it, you'll figure it out.

You just got to play on through, mate.

I might.

I don't think so.

Oh, you just said that.

I might be a little bit there.

It's all right.

I mean, it's all right.

Yeah.

It's all right.

Don't think about it.

Just play on through it.

Just find it.

Just stop by to tell you.

Who was Jason?

Yeah, right.

Why are all these people here?

Just let them go.

I stopped by.

Is there anything new you could go on?

Let these two talk to each other.

I stopped by to tell you it's getting harder and harder to ignore things about the royals in the real Australia.

Oh, no.

It's getting nearly important.

Oh, no.

It's nice.

Yes.

So I've had to leave.

I've had to leave there.

So I've packed up and left.

I've packed up and left.

So you're here now.

Right now I'm here.

Okay.

Because my dear friend, the zerg, so you guys are friends.

With best years.

Yeah, with best friends.

Oh, it's opposite of here.

Yes.

He was coming here and I said, I don't know how to ignore all this nonsense.

Oh, okay.

Now, now that our Queen Elizabeth has become immortal, his mum is a lady in Lima.

Oh, right.

He was trying to get me adopted by her and I thought, I don't fit you.

You mean, mate, I can't do it.

And then finally I did it because we're mates.

Wow.

So that's great.

So you guys get to live together now?

Oh, yeah.

That's right.

We're the very beast of friends.

The best of friends.

This is great.

This is a really happy ending.

Borin, who are you?

Nora.

This is Byron.

My best mate.

No, that's not a good idea.

You're going to get stuck in Byron.

You're terrible.

You guys can't talk to each other.

I doubt it.

No, some of us can barely talk at all.

And this is our, by the way.

Oh, who's that?

This is the Gris.

He's wrapped up in salt butter caffes.

He's like a pupa.

Don't let out the Gris.

He's wrapped up there and, yes, that's it for him.

Is that why?

Is that a saying here?

Don't let out the Gris.

He's now.

Don't let out the Gris.

It sounds like the tag line of an advert, doesn't it?

Almost.

Don't let out the Gris.

Anyway, he's struggling a little bit, but.

Yeah.

Byron trapped him.

Do you know, Dan, in Australia, if you was to give the zerg, a water taffy wrapping, he becomes like Popeye.

Oh, extraordinarily strong.

Oh, oh, oh.

Oh, oh.

Now, like Popeye with spinach.

Oh, oh, oh.

You know, you know, like Popeye eats spinach and he gets real strong.

Right.

American Popeye.

American.

Stay away from me.

In Australia, Popeye can't have spinach.

It makes him very weak.

Who's his iPod?

It's iPod and it reduces it.

It attacks his immune system.

Oh, no.

It just comes susceptible to all diseases.

I just want to say, I am so glad to be here.

Learning so much about Australia.

Yeah.

In Australia.

Don't tell anyone.

No, we wouldn't tell anybody.

I can't imagine anybody from Australia who's listening is going to have any problem with any of this.

No, no, no, no.

And if anything, they'll realize they've been doing their accent wrong.

Right.

Yeah.

You're only going to hear from people in the decoy Australia.

It's not what we say.

Oh, right.

Yeah.

So, are a lot of the people, the Hugh Jackman's, the Hemsworth's, are they from the decoy Australia?

Oh, yeah.

They're from Decoy Australia.

Oh.

And they've got opposites in real Australia.

Oh, wow.

Yeah.

Cirque.

The last names are harder aren't they?

You're right, mate.

I seem to be having an episode.

I can do with a lighter.

He's a lighter.

He's lying down.

She's really difficult to say Hemsworth's backwards.

There's a Jack human.

These guys are really human.

Jack human.

Jack, his name is Jack.

Jack human.

Not, not, not good.

It sounds like the opposite.

Jack human.

You know the director Lou Basman?

He made that movie about Levi's?

Three hours.

All about jeans.

Yeah.

Three hour long movie about jeans.

The part where the jeans become addicted to drugs was very powerful.

But home tanks is in it.

I'm tanks.

Good.

Do you celebrate home tanks giving?

Of course we do.

First of January.

Guys, guys, we're running out of time.

I hate that you just got here and we're running out of time.

That sounds like it's about all you can do.

Well, I mean, I could go for another 15 minutes.

Just reversing names.

You just got the trip's very long.

He's exhausted.

I'm sorry.

We are running out of time.

We only have time for one song.

Who told you about songs?

Oh, it's arms.

It's arms.

I'm sorry.

The planet, the full planet.

That's right.

We've got our own solo system down there.

Oh my God.

Of course we do.

Cool.

Sweetie.

Incredible.

Alright, well, we're running out of time.

The only time we have is for the...

We're going to play the cool Mayianist.

Go ahead.

Okay.

Come on, follow me through.

That's a little something called plug.

Sweetie.

Try your time.

All of the love to see, see, see, to focus.

No one can see I do I.

But I know we can all be thankful then.

The invented podcast.

Oh, yeah.

The heady, the dead.

We need a hero and then let's be happy.

Oh, yeah.

Ooh, that was Conan invented podcast by Weetay.

Weetay.

Always nice.

We had the inventor of podcasts on our show out there in North Carolina, I believe.

Nice.

If you want to hear that, he was kind enough to drop eye for about ten minutes.

He's got nothing on No-Kek.

Oh, he...

No-Kek Brino?

Yeah, No-Kek Brino.

Yeah.

He doesn't need any friends.

I'm...

Let's go.

Alright, what do you want to plug, Jason?

What do you got?

I mean, my mind trying to reverse J. Leno.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh, Ned.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

He has no questions about...

Gug.

Cugrad.

Back with you, bro.

Okay, good.

Oh, man.

I'm going to plug a show that has already been canceled.

I've said it before, I'll say it again.

It's called Paper Girls.

It's on Amazon Prime.

It is fantastic.

It is really worth watching.

Not enough people watch it, so they canceled it and I'm fucking pissed off.

So watch it now, watch all of it, set your thing to watch every auto play, every episode, tweet at people, send tampons to people.

Yeah, especially at King Charles.

Send tampons to King Charles and Camilla Parker-Balls as well as everybody at Amazon.

It's funny to imagine he'd be amused by that.

He'd send him to watch a tampon, so he'd be like, I'll get it.

Well, they get to him.

This is pretty good.

You imagine he's going to his PO box.

Your Majesty, we've got another delivery for you.

Oh, Brigadier.

I think he'd never stop laughing.

It'd be just as funny every time.

That's true.

Byron, anything you want to play?

Well, you know, I have a podcast called The Royal Roundup.

Oh, right.

From time to time, it appears.

And you can always go to CBBWorld.com for all of your sort of podcasting needs.

Wonderful.

And how about you, Norrib?

I've got a podcast where I talk of Norrib it.

Of course, I know, Norrib it.

I've got a...

Mate, hey, you going, I've got a podcast.

He's in T-Bron.

T-Bron?

Norbit.

Norbit in...

Oh, the real skinny family.

What about Bromley James?

Okay.

I've got a podcast where I talk about everything but the royals.

Oh, that must be every subject under the sun.

It takes a long time.

Yeah.

It's like...

How long is every...

It's all but one hour a week.

Oh, okay.

Wow.

So you release it in that hour.

This is opposite, by the way.

Wow.

That is...

Those episodes are long, man.

I can't lie, mate.

I'm a little backed up on episodes.

It's perfectly understandable.

They keep stacking up in the queue.

Yeah.

You've only got the one hour to keep jumping.

I did get...

I finally got through the one last year without toothpaste.

Very good.

Yeah.

Each episode is about something, a different topic that's not the royals.

So you're doing seven days just on toothpaste.

I mean, there's a lot to cover.

Well, there's so many different breeds.

Yeah, true.

You've got deep dive into every brand of toothpaste.

Is there a greeting you want to plug?

Well, I like to plug teenage bounty hunters on Netflix.

Only ran one series, but I think it's still up there if you want to watch it.

Okay.

One of the greatest shows I've really enjoyed it.

Okay.

Great.

What I'm telling you about... when's this dropping?

Monday, Monday, Monday.

Monday.

Monday, Monday the 19th.

In September, you're September.

What do you have?

September, September.

Um, October 15th, Saturday, October 15th, the Allegiant Theatre.

Paul F. Tompkins presents a show called Veriotope Yole.

It's a country version of his variety show.

Veriotope Yole.

Yeah, stripped down acoustic instruments, two shows.

Okay.

Saturday night, October 15th.

All right, gotta go see that.

That's a lot of ghosts.

May I jump back in again, Scott?

Sure.

Just because I realized that the date was earlier than I thought.

How did this get made?

We'll be live in Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland, and...

sorry, sorry, not Cleveland.

We are not in Cleveland.

Absolutely not.

Cleveland was a great show, by the way.

You're not in Cleveland.

Great news.

We are in North... what's it called?

Northfield?

Thank you.

Northfield, Ohio, not Cleveland.

We've been told to say it is not Cleveland.

Northfield, Ohio, and Chicago.

So at the end of October, please come out and see our rescheduled from when I had COVID.

How did this get made?

Uh, any new dates or you just...

Nude dates?

Yeah, any new dates?

Yeah, I've got a bunch of new dates coming up.

Yeah, we'll see.

If you have a McHale Gorbachev style blotch on your penis.

We will?

Of course we're dealing with...

Who's in that week?

Oh, I'm gonna...

We're dealing with Devock down in Australia right now?

Devock.

Yeah, still going through it.

Go COVID!

Everybody's there.

So you're just becoming more and more powerful.

Even things like COVID are reversed.

So Devock, we've all had to take off our masks.

We've all had to take off our masks.

We usually wear them all the time.

Yeah.

I'm gonna...

I'm gonna just...

We're breathing so well.

It's just like ripping through the mouth.

Oh my God.

I wanna plug...

Head over to Comedy Bang Bang World or CBBWorld.com and you can get all of that...

You wanna plug the head in over there?

Yep.

The idea of...

Just the idea of going there.

The concept of going to CBB World.

Yeah, just the internet in general.

Have you thought at all about making it an actual world?

I have thought about you.

Like Disney World or...

Or like an actual planet?

Oh, well, that's even harder.

But like a destination.

Sure, yeah, definitely.

Definitely.

You could be the king of it.

Oh!

And hit the bottom of the spaceship.

I don't want you trying to marry me or murder me.

You become the king of CBBWorld.com and I'll marry you and I'll solve all of our problems.

No, no, no.

I'm head over there and you can check out the archives of this show as well as ad-free episodes.

As well as things like CBB Presents.

We just had another episode of You Can't Handle the Sloots as well as the Andy Daily Podcast Project.

I think...

Which is very, very funny.

Also, I'm really enjoying...

Hey, Randy.

Hey, Randy, yeah.

So many things over there.

Alright, let's close up the old plug bag.

I have it!

Oh, no!

Still going?

It took my headphones off.

Oh, yeah, that was...

It's still going.

Plugged my soul.

Sparklonious Remix by Josh Goodman and Tully and Nadell.

Thanks so much for that.

And guys, what a great show.

Thank you so much, Jason.

So good to have you.

Great to see you.

So fun.

Byron, awesome to see you again.

Wonderful to be here.

Hopefully I'll just go and rebuild my life and come back and tell you how that went.

Sure, yeah.

Norib, so nice to meet you.

A new friend to the show.

I don't really have anything else to say.

I get it.

I think we're going to talk to both of you more though.

Yeah, so good to meet you.

Yeah, just the last time.

Let's all take a big sip of water here to celebrate...

Oh, no, I spilled the water.

Oh, no, I spilled the...

Oh, no, the paper is disintegrated!

Oh, no, the Gris is loose!

The Gris is loose!

The Gris is lizz!

Oh, no!

I'll never get him wrapped up again.

Oh, just wrap him up in this paper.

Alright.

Okay, well you did it.

Alright, we'll see you next time.

Bye!
