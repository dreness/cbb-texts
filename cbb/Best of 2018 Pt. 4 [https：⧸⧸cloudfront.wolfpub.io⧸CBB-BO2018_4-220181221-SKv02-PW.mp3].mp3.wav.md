♪♪ Out of the frying pan into the fire, your method of cooking leaves much to desire.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Thank you to Charlie Murphy Brown for that catchphrase submission.

Oh, Murphy Brown, R-I-B.

Yeah, and Charlie Murphy, R-I-B.

Oh, that's true.

Wait, are you saying the character Murphy Brown has done?

Yeah, I mean, their shell's cancelled, so maybe not officially, but...

What, I mean, were they planning on just...

They're planning on being a big hit.

I don't think anyone plans on doing something without going like, this is gonna be huge.

Well, I guess I thought it was a limited thing.

Yeah, I mean, they limited it in the sense of the only ordered 10 or whatever, but they wanted more.

Is Will and Grace is the idea that that is just gonna continue?

Yeah, exactly.

It was such a big hit, and the Rosanne thing was such a big hit.

They were like, yeah, let's bring back anything.

And then Murphy Brown, they were like, ooh, no one likes this.

All right, see, we'll check in with you in another 10 years.

It's not quite the same thing, I guess.

Well, also, I don't know that anyone liked Murphy Brown when it was out, right?

It was very popular.

It was popular, but...

It was first on?

Fair popular.

All those people have passed on.

Yeah, they're all with whom it was popular.

They're all dead.

By the way, welcome to the show.

Mostly to get back at 10.

Welcome to the show.

Yeah, I know.

Oh man, he's stirring in his hot seat there, his juices.

He'll never be by president again, but that show got brought back on the air.

You think Tankwell could be president?

Like if he was like...

100%.

Welcome to the show.

This is Comedy Bang Bang, best of 2018, part four.

If you haven't heard parts one through three, what the fuck are you doing with your lives?

I hate you!

Get out of here!

Get out of my dreams.

And into my car.

Those are your choices?

You have two choices.

And I know you can't control the first.

You have two choices.

Get out of my dreams or get into my car.

They're going to find you.

You're going to be taken out of my dreams.

I knew you were going to my car.

Welcome to the show.

I'm Scott Ocarman.

Across the desk for me is Mr. Paul of Topgaze.

We got bought a desk.

You know that movie we bought a zoo?

We bought a zoo.

This is like that.

But with a desk.

So far less interesting.

But more compelling somehow.

It is somehow more compelling.

You know why?

Because the drawers are filled with tiny zoo animals.

It's true.

They're alive, but shrunken down.

I think I knew someone, or maybe I was dating someone who's friend, told me the story that they were in San Francisco.

And they bought a desk with their significant, they were moving in with their girlfriend.

And they went out to a furniture store and bought a desk.

And they were so excited.

They were moving in together.

And when they went up to pay for it, the person behind the counter said, Oh, the desk has been taken care of by that gentleman over there.

And they look over and it's Joe Montana.

And he's he says, and he says, You guys are so cute together.

And you remind me of when I got together with my wife, that I just wanted to buy this desk for you.

That I feel like this is a story.

Someone told me at some point.

But someone that I with whom I do not speak any any longer, as they were perhaps a friend of a previous relationship or something.

But I think that's a true.

And if you're out there and it's you, we want to hear from you.

How's it Joe Montana listening?

Joe, hit us up.

That is that is simultaneously the most and least romantic thing I've ever heard.

Most from in which side of it, most and least from most most because the idea that your love would inspire someone to buy a high ticket item like a desk.

Right, because we're I mean, this must be $1,500 or something, you know, but also it's a it's a boring thing.

Yeah, I know.

It's not like you're like, hey, buy them a drink, which is kind of romantic.

Yeah, or dinner like they're dinner.

Dinner's on me and you look over.

Oh my God, Joe Montana.

Joe Montana, no, it's like, but he bought them like a $1,500 desk.

Yeah, it's weird.

And then he explained himself and it was romantic.

It is romantic, but it's, I don't know.

You know what, because I'm picturing like the harsh fluorescent lights.

Harsh glare of the department store.

Unless it was a candle at department store.

It may have been.

Which sounds beautiful.

Sounds beautiful, but it is a fire hazard.

Like if you go to a Staples and it's lit by candles, Oh, it's just beautiful.

They have like those old fashioned gas lamps.

Oh, yeah, you would love it.

You would never want to leave Staples.

You would love it.

You knew it.

You would love it.

Stay perfect, Drew.

I know you're 17, but come on.

I choose to believe it.

And I think Joe Montana, is that who I'm thinking of?

Because he's San Francisco.

It's got to be him, right?

From the 49ers.

Yeah, from the 149ers.

Anyway, wonderful story.

And I choose to believe it.

And so I'm going to.

But that couple, maybe not still together?

Probably not.

I mean, what are the odds?

50-50.

You know what I think happens?

Because this sounds familiar to me now.

I think Joe Montana.

The million to me now.

The islands.

Familiar to me now.

The rhythm.

I think that Joe Montana was buying people desks as a gag.

All day.

And they were all...

Was it part of a prank show?

It was part of a prank show that never aired.

Okay.

Yeah, right.

It was Joe Montana's jacking the desk.

So he was jacking it?

No, no.

Oh, there was a puppet in the desk that was jacking.

Oh, got it.

When they opened the desk.

The puppet would pop out.

But they never picked up the pilot, so the puppets never popped out.

Is that what?

No, people did get those desks and they took them home.

Oh.

And but here's what would happen.

It's a camera crew would follow that first.

The camera crew was there hidden cameras.

Sure.

They would follow them.

Followed them.

Then they have to follow the desk.

Followed home.

And then before the people go into their house and say, please, please, please, please.

Can we just go in real quick?

Can we just like go in?

Yeah, let us just watch you open this desk.

Can we not?

Well, they couldn't tip it off.

Sure.

They had to come on an excuse to get into the home.

Can we borrow some sugar?

Can we borrow some sugar with you outside?

And then they would put the jack in the desk there?

No, the jack is already in the desk at the store.

So what are they doing?

Just setting up a hidden camera.

Just setting up the cameras.

Oh, yes.

This is a good show.

Why did this not get picked up?

Wow.

Joe Montana's Jack of the desk.

It was politics.

Oh, yeah.

Politics.

Yeah.

Republican.

Yes.

Yeah.

There was a grain embargo from the...

The...

Teriffs.

The Empire.

From the Grand Moff.

The Grand Moff himself stopped by and said, this show will not air.

Well, I choose to believe that I think Joe Montana is out there just buying desks for people.

Yeah.

Well, it's sad now because he's lost his mind.

That's true.

If you could be out there and buy a desk for someone, would you?

What a question.

Oh, damn.

If you could be out there...

If I could be out there buying a desk for someone...

If I could be out there buying a desk for someone, would you?

I'd do it.

I like to think that I would.

If you could...

Am I ever going to be in that situation?

Are you ever going to be out there?

I don't know if I'm going to be out there.

If you could be out there and buy a desk for someone, would you?

In these streets, for sure.

Right, definitely.

I don't know if I'm buying desks.

I don't know if you're going to be out there, though.

If you could be out there...

If I could be out there buying desks for people, would I?

I hope so.

But I don't know.

We have lost our minds by the fourth episode.

If you don't know...

Right, it's right on schedule.

How Paul and I do this is...

You're listening to these over a two-week period.

I hope.

We tape them all back to back.

Why?

People should listen to these back to back.

Yes.

With their loved ones.

Back to back.

Sick.

All of your loved ones stand back to back.

And then you walk 50 paces.

That's right.

Turn around and fire.

Turn it fire.

Shoot yourselves.

Shoot each other.

Oh, that's creepy.

Shoot him!

That's creepy.

Shoot him!

Yelling.

With squirt guns.

Of course.

50.

That was close.

Filled with bleach.

That was a thing.

I feel like that was a thing that kids were doing.

Squirt guns filled...

Oh, to stain someone's clothes to that...

No, I think to blind them.

Oh.

I was...

I think it was an aggressive move.

Did I just hear a computer?

G-boop.

I heard that too.

I heard it.

We both heard it.

I'll just hear that.

How could we hear that?

How could we hear that, Sam?

Donkey!

Oh, he was dunk back?

Oh, can you imagine?

I swear I heard a computer sound in here.

He's doing his blanket gymnastics.

So we are...

This is an exciting episode, Paul, because we are going to hear the top three episodes of 2018.

Do you know what when you told me that I thought you were making it up to...

Just fucking around.

I thought you were trying to sound cool.

Yeah.

And now that it's real, I can't believe it and I feel embarrassed.

Yeah, well, you should, but you should also feel excited because it's happening.

And I feel honored to be here.

Well, I am honored to have you.

How many years have we been doing this together?

Three.

It's got to be more than that.

We haven't been doing it all 10 years, have we?

No, but close to.

Close to?

Yeah, I think...

Yeah, maybe nine of the 10?

Listeners, we want to hear from you.

Text one for Joe Montana, two for 10.

You know what?

The top episodes of the year are always fun to listen to.

The episodes are always fun to listen to because they're the ones voted on by you as the best.

And we accept your opinion over ours.

Sure.

We're, we're spineless weaklings who can't make up their own minds about anything.

So thank you, master.

No, this is great.

We had over 35,000 votes this year.

I mean, that's a lot of votes for something that, I mean, more people listen to the show, but...

That's as many as 10.

To actually like write down your favorite episodes of the year and then go...

That's many, that's many stuff, Trump kind of that, like, Trump calls.

What?

That's, that's many stuff Trump got from the electric college.

No, he got like 290.

Joe, do you 90 votes?

Yeah.

That's not a lot.

No.

That's, you only need 270.

Oh no.

Oh no, what?

He's president.

Our system.

Yeah, we're...

Oh no, oh no, our system.

I know, it's crazy.

Hey, do you think there will still be an Earth by the time...

By the time this comes out, well, let's see, this is coming out on January 3rd or so.

Well, I think that might be an Earth.

Not too much longer after that.

Let me, if there was some sort of thermonuclear devastation, then...

Would these episodes still come out?

Yeah.

That we've prerecorded?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well, if they're uploaded...

Is there a system...

Is there an in- Yeah, is it an automated system, Sam?

Get off your phone and don't talk into the mic.

Sam, you have to pay attention to us every single second.

He's pointing again, like Superman.

Superman.

Do it with a Superman, but don't get on my...

Don't you get on...

Don't you get...

This isn't throwing shade, this isn't Hollywood again.

No, we're not gonna make a star out of you on this show.

We aren't those men, hashtag.

Those men.

But why were we talking...

Why do we ask Sam?

Oh yeah, is it automated?

Like, once these are all edited together, do they get pushed out automatically?

I would imagine if there was a thermonuclear war that the internet wouldn't exist, and so they wouldn't go out there, but...

Well, but I mean, like, they're in some sort of cloud.

They must be stored somewhere on some sort of...

But I mean, that's the whole thing about digital media, is that they're only as good as the devices which we have to decode them.

That's very true, man.

So it's, you know, and that's pretty much all recordings throughout time.

I mean...

You better call this the true man show.

When they...

When they invented the phonograph record, it's not like you own music, you own this piece of plastic that if you own...

It's not the phonograph record.

It's not Adam and Onograph record.

It's Adam and PONAGRAF record!

It's a PONEW!

So, undoubtedly, they'd be uploaded to some sort of machine that clickety-clacks, but no one would have any way to retrieve it.

Without a doubt.

So, really, what are we doing all this for?

I don't know.

It's fun to do while we do it.

Scott, I think you're fun and cracked it, dude.

I mean, that's the only reason to do anything, right?

It's fun to do it all the way down.

Also, to survive and to food and shelter.

And to food.

And to food and to shelter.

To survive, to food, to shelter.

But what kind of legacy will we have upon this Earth?

I used to think about that more.

Really?

No, you don't care?

No, I don't think about it as much.

Really?

Well, now, I'm given this I don't have one, so...

What do you mean?

I think it's...

There's so much stuff.

You create so much happiness in the world that when you retire, I'm not going to say when you shuffle off this mortal coil.

But when you retire from show business, which I hope you never do, I think that you should...

I think you should never be allowed to.

Personally, I think that you should...

Even if you had a nest egg that you could just say, you know, fuck it, I'm out.

I think that you would be one of those people who just keeps doing it.

You do it for the love.

Exactly.

You're the king of podcasting.

You're on so many podcasts that I don't think anything could keep you away.

What if podcasts stop happening?

That's a problem.

I'm done.

You are done.

That's it?

Well, I mean, look at you.

You went from stand-up comedy.

Look at you.

You're a piece of shit.

You went from stand-up comedy, then you segued into writing and acting on television, then you segued it.

There would be something new for you to get into.

Oh, I hope mobisodes were supposed to take off.

Yeah, remember mobisodes?

I was going to show for the Motorola RACER.

That was the thing.

We wanted to do that on Know You Shut Up, which was an episode that was optimized for Motorola RACER, and just haven't been a little square in the middle of the screen.

Right.

I remember those years when I was approached about creating content for phones.

Oh, yeah.

Which I guess all stuff is created for phones now, but this was back when people had flip phones.

Yes, exactly.

And they were trying to say, people are on their phones a lot.

We're going to create content for phones, simply for phones.

It was like, when they wanted me to simply for phones do.

I think it was a particular phone company wanted me to create stand-up based stuff, because I was doing the show with the UCV, the stand-up show.

Was it American telephone and telegraph?

It may have been.

And they were like, look, Watson, we need you.

Get in here.

Come here. Do you say I want you?

Yeah. Was it I want you or I need you?

I always thought it was a very thirsty Edison.

Talking about a thirst trap, he invented the phone.

He's like, I invented these texting things.

The original thirst trap.

Thomas, Alva Edison.

Meanwhile, you got Alexander Graham Bell.

Oh, that's right.

Meanwhile, you got Notorious Power Bottom.

Membonies are screwdriver here.

Just going like, hey, hey, get up here.

But yeah, I remember those years.

And I remember the years before that at around 2001 or so, when people were saying like, you got to come create some content for computers now, and we're going to use flash animation.

Come join us at Icebox.

Yes.

I remember that was one of the place.

And everyone had left all of their jobs for regular television networks.

Left their families.

They didn't have to leave their family.

No, they did though.

Real, that's part of their contract.

There were people, no, there were people.

You must renounce your wife.

There were people like, I don't, what the fuck do I need you for anymore?

I'm under work for the computer.

I'm going to do this racist cartoon for the computer.

But yeah, everyone left their jobs and they just went into these other jobs that were gone within a year.

Yeah.

Meanwhile, podcasting, still standing.

You mentioned on some podcast recently that weird trailer park farm.

Trailer park.

Where?

You were doing that show with Bill Dwyer and Karen Kilgarov.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

For the most people.

Yeah.

And I remember like the naked news.

They were doing, yeah, naked news.

And they were doing it.

Second, I believe Second City was co-branded that.

But it was like, there was some spade of radio, it's some like radio shows that people were doing.

And then Greg Barron had a show at the Peter set a show.

I wasn't at the trailer park farm, but I remember what you're talking about.

Yeah.

Because I went to it.

Yeah, I went to see, I believe Dave Anthony and Greg Barron's performed their show, right?

Yeah.

And I was like, yeah, it was a warehouse with trailers inside that everyone did radio shows here or something.

Yeah.

It was weird.

It felt very ephemeral.

Like you walked in there like, this can't last.

I guess I was impressed by the scale.

And I was like, oh, wow.

And we were all pretty young.

And so it was like cool to see Dave.

Well, the trailer was for 100 feet tall.

Yeah, it's cool to see Dave and Greg have a, like it was like a real job.

I was.

But yeah, the thing that I did was, it was in Santa Monica, which is the worst.

But it was topical jokes that we had to write first thing in the morning.

And especially we're on the West Coast.

So we had to get up really early.

We had to get up at five in the morning or something.

Beat traffic, go out to Santa Monica.

And then write topical jokes about four subject matters.

The news entertainment.

The news.

Sports.

And what was the other one?

I know there was a four.

Religion.

Writing religion jokes.

Oh my god.

This is in 1997 for MSN or MSNBC maybe.

And I think it was just MSN.

Was it MSN at the point?

It was MSN and it was the second city naked news.

And so it was me and Karen Kilgareff and Bill Dwyer and.

Like Nichols and Lane May.

Yeah.

Okay.

All of us.

Avery Schreiber.

Santa Rosanna Danna.

And we would write these jokes every day and a proxy.

We would write them starting at like, you know, 8 a.m.

And then approximately noon, we would try to write like two pages of topical jokes a day.

At noon, we would read through them all.

And then we would record them for this basic, like it was a radio play with flash animation.

Yeah.

That people were supposed to watch, I guess.

Yeah.

It was like for basic a bitches.

I do remember that that Bill Dwyer had a leg up on his because he had such a funny delivery that even if the joke he wrote wasn't good, he would always add a tag that was such in his voice.

That we would always like the tag better than the joke.

We go, all right, we pick that one.

Just to hear him do the tag.

Fun times, 1997, but technically my first professional writing job.

Congratulations.

Thank you so much.

Lasted a summer and then canceled.

But you got in there.

That's the important thing.

That's the important thing is I got my foot in that door.

Yeah.

And it's still there.

It's still there.

Still going, hey, show biz.

And you're blocking away for other people to get in.

Oh, definitely.

Hey, show biz.

If I can block 10 people a day from getting what I have, that's what I tried to do.

It's a numbers game.

Show biz.

That was fun though.

That was a fun summer.

You were working on Mr. Show and we would talk on the phone occasionally.

Yes.

From our respective offices.

Fun times, 1997.

That's when you used to talk on the phone.

Yeah.

Well, was that a weird thing to do?

We would have hour long conversations on the phone back then.

Like you and I.

Yeah.

Sometimes.

Yeah.

So bizarre.

Yeah.

I mean, normally, here's what would happen is I remember this from 95 to about 98 or so.

Around four or five o'clock in the afternoon, suddenly everyone would start making a round of phone calls to each other to try to ascertain where we were all meeting that night.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And it was like, hey, have you heard anything about where we're meeting today?

I don't know who was making the decision on where we were meeting, but it was never me.

But it was always like, do you know where we're meeting and someone would go, oh, yeah.

Mary Lynn and CJ have a show over here on this night.

So we're all going to meet there and go this place afterwards.

If no one had a show, then everyone would pick a particular bar for whatever reason it would be.

This was right before cell phones.

Yes.

Before everybody had cell phones.

Yes.

And we all found our- And technically, I mean, the internet was still around, but I remember not really having- I would get one email a day probably through 1998 or 1999 or so.

You know, you would- you turn on and the whole- you've got mail.

Yeah.

Was like, nowadays, can you imagine that?

Like, of course I have mail.

I get hundreds a day.

Of course I do, you idiot.

But at the time it was like- Why do you sound so surprised?

It was a lot like getting a letter in the mail.

It was like, oh well- It's 100- Yeah, like one a day if that- Now imagine- Imagine if you had- With vitamins.

Imagine if you were getting so many letters every day that you had a stack like you just- This is- You're just like on the floor.

And you're like, I gotta get back to these people.

That's like, uh, I don't know.

Imagine- Imagine- Imagine- Just throw this one away.

I'm never gonna get back to them.

Like not opening mail immediately.

Like, what did I get?

What's this?

Boy.

But at the time, we had no way to contact each other.

But we all found ourselves in offices.

Right.

So we all had phones.

We all had phones, but I do remember- I didn't want to do work.

95 to 96.

I don't think some of us had jobs.

So it would just be at home, I remember.

Yeah.

And you just call up people and you talk to them for a good hour or so, trying to figure out and just saying what's- What's up with them that day?

But we all, every comedian in this circle of friends met every single night and drank somewhere and every single night.

Cat in the fiddle quite often.

Um, and it was usually based on who had a stand-up set earlier in the night.

That we would all go watch and then find the bar next to- After that.

Fun stuff.

It was fun stuff.

But the communication trail is really the part that was exciting.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

That seems like the idea of talking on the phone for that long seems absurd to me now.

That's how my wife and I got together.

Is she called on the phone?

You were a phone sex operator.

I was supposed to say.

And I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar.

Which she met you.

Yeah.

No, she called on the phone and I talked to her for two hours, I believe, on the phone.

And I had only met her a couple of times and made plans to go out the following week.

And that's how it happened.

You know?

The rest is history.

It truly and the future.

I hope the rest is the future.

What if I get home and the rest?

She's not there.

Oh, that would be weird.

I heard the rest was history, so I left.

He's on the- She's on the- Do you think that song would pop into your head?

I think so.

If I looked around, okay, it would take me a little time.

I would have dabbedo with it.

Of course.

And it would take me a little time to actually accept that what was happening was happening.

It was like she really left.

But then suddenly, I think at that point, it would pop in my head.

She's not there.

I'd be so mad.

I'd be so mad if that popped into my head at the wrong stage of dabbedo.

Yeah.

At which stage are you talking about on ad?

Denial, anger, betrayal, bargaining.

I always mess up betrayal with bargaining.

I think in the in the A.B.D.

A.B.D.

It's as easy as one, two, three.

Paul?

Yeah, Scott.

I have to tell you that we have to get to the first clip on this countdown.

Well, then I have to be gotten to it.

I think we've been talking for over a half hour and have not gotten to the first clip.

People like this.

People enjoy this.

It's like this.

I have to hear us shooting the shit.

But let's get to it.

Tell you what, we're doing the top three today.

And these are important episodes.

This is just how it is.

This is just what happens when you do a countdown.

Let's get to it.

This is episode number three.

Okay, episode number three.

I want people to know.

Yeah.

These are the top three.

That's it.

That is it.

There's not, we're not going to be like, oh, here's a few.

Oh, we made them.

There's not that.

There's also like, oh, we made a mistake.

This one's actually number one.

This is actually number.

This is it.

This is the official order.

By the way, and we're not going to do a bottom three either.

Fuck.

With that P-horrible, all the performers.

I'll be interested in new than new than the, oh, I did the least popular ones in the year.

Look, I see those types of stats, but.

That you do.

What are you telling me about there?

No.

Because I'm in them.

You said it with bitch.

Okay, this is episode 534.

Okay.

Still on the 534.

If you can't believe it.

This is an episode called Solid as a Rock.

And the participants are.

Do you know what?

What?

Solid as a rock.

Acronyms to soar.

Soar.

That's beautiful.

It's sour actually.

No, it doesn't.

I just realized.

Solid or a rock.

Well, speaking of that song, you're going to hear it a few times.

The people involved are Paul Rust and Claudia Odordi.

That's right.

From the television show Love.

Sure.

Paul is the co-creator of it and the co-star of it.

And Claudia is one of the supporting characters on it.

That's right.

And for a few years, Paul and Gillian, Jacobs, who is co-starred on the show with him, would come and do the episodes.

But I think she was doing a Broadway play or something.

And so she could not come.

Just some weird excuse.

She did do another episode that is not in our countdown.

Which is a fun episode.

But so Paul and Claudia are there at the top.

The first thing you are going to hear is, look, Paul Rust I've known for all of this preface.

Look, Paul Rust I've known for a long time.

I have known him since probably like the first few months when he moved out here from Iowa.

And he and Neil Campbell and Mike Cassidy, they all had their group together.

And so I've known him a long time, really a dear friend.

And what I love about Paul is, and if you watch the television show Love, personally, did you watch it or did you watch it?

I really enjoyed that show.

And I thought it was so unique in the themes that it was discussing.

And certain things that got me frustrated about Paul's character were resolved by the end of it in a really interesting way.

Anyway, I just thought it was such an artistic achievement and such great performances from Mitch and Claudia.

So anyway, go check that show out on Netflix.

It's not going away. They did three seasons.

Can I point out one quibble?

Yeah.

And this is not, didn't ruin the series for me, but it did give me Paul's early on because it happens early on.

Okay.

There's a scene where Paul is gathered with some of the other people who live in his apartment complex, this condo world or whatever.

Right.

They live basically at the, like the Oakwood.

The Oakwood, yeah, the Oakwood, yeah, yeah.

And you know, Paul and Gillian's character have just embarked on this.

They're just, their relationship is lots of...

They've just gone on a few dates or whatever.

And then, so the guys are asking him, so what's going on with her and with you and her?

And he says, well, you know, it's like a real Adam Baldwin, Meryl Streep situation.

Adam Baldwin?

I'm sorry, Alec Baldwin.

Alec Baldwin, Meryl Streep situation.

It's complicated.

And they go, huh?

And then he goes, it's complicated.

And then they all laugh.

And they'll end real life.

Yeah.

People would roll their eyes.

Basically, the...

Basically, whatever happens when I'm talking.

Those people being, though, if they were those real people in real life, would say, what?

No, let me tell you something, though.

If those people were who they are in real life, because I've worked with most of those people in a writer's room, I believe Mike Hanford was one of the friends.

And who else was in there?

I believe Dave Groobrell was there.

Okay.

I've not worked with him in a writer's room.

Steve?

Steve from, yeah, from Freaks and Geats.

Yes, a bad answer.

Steve Gay, yeah.

The guy who's so good who played the kind of dumb stuntman guy.

Oh, yeah, he's great, but I don't know what he's doing.

I can't remember his name.

Never met him.

Yeah, he's so good.

He's really good.

On commercials now.

On commercials now?

Yeah.

But I thought it was with all the people at his...

Who played his in his band.

No.

Oh, it's just with the other people.

Okay.

Because those people would definitely laugh.

Of course, those people would, yes.

Yeah, but Hanman would love it.

Hanman would die for it.

Anyway, what I was trying to say though about Paul's show.

Yeah, it was trying to be funny.

And I guess the bad guy.

So, yeah, I mean, it was not cool what you said about Paul.

It was not cool?

It was not cool.

The not cool were here.

I recognize the delegate from Raku.

Naku.

Yeah, it just happened.

I know, but I was trying to think of the word delegate.

And I was successful and pretty happy about it.

But I'm not a fan of it.

So about Paul's show is it's kind of a cereal comedy.

Because it gets serious.

It's big issues.

I'm not too ashamed to admit that I had a tear in my eye a few times.

Oh, no, me, man.

I'm sorry.

I'm not a pussy.

I'm not saying...

I'm stone cold.

But so he has that side to him where he's a serious guy.

But the thing I love about Paul too is he's one of the silliest guys I know.

He's very silly.

And he was one of the Bang Bang writers for the first three seasons.

So he's so silly.

Anyway, so the first thing that we're going to hear is his recurring segment that he's done on the show several times called New No-Nose, which is his parody of Bill Maher's new rules.

So we'll hear that.

And then this is exciting.

We have two people who are making their first appearances on the countdown in position number three.

That's impressive.

This is Carl Tarte and Ego Nwodim.

Ego Wodim.

Ego what?

Wodim.

Oh, okay.

I said the N, but I should not have.

And I said Eem instead of him.

That's right.

I don't think that I've ever like I have known her just as Ego for so long.

I don't think I've ever had occasion to actually say her name, but that's good to know.

It is good to know and it's fun to know.

It's fun to know Wodim.

Wodim.

Yeah.

Wodim.

Well, anyway, Ego and Ego is of course now on Saturday Night Live.

That's right.

And Ego and Carl have not been, Ego made a big splash on the show.

She has been on only for maybe six months before she got an SNL.

So she did a handful of episodes, which are some of my favorites.

And then Carl has been a writer on Brooklyn Nine Nine and has not been available.

I know.

They have not been on the show this year all that much.

I know.

I lost them from my show too.

Yeah.

It's sad, sad day when those guys got jobs.

I know.

I guess I'm happy for them.

I'm not.

But this is one of the last episodes they did before they left.

And they are playing Bashford and Franklin, who I mentioned previously.

This is a wonderfully silly episode.

I really enjoy it.

This is your number three.

Number three.

Are you getting heated?

I'm getting heated.

Are you getting cheesed?

I'm getting cheesed.

Is it time?

This cheese is melting because it's heating up.

Is it time for our favorite segment on this show?

That's right.

Is it time for start the clock?

Start the clock.

Good afternoon.

That's a no.

Oh man.

It's time for some new no-no.

No-no-no.

No-no-no-no.

Oh boy.

If you've never heard these before, this is where Paul gets some things off his ample chest.

Yeah.

I got a little steamed about stuff and people like to hear it get off my chest and you know there's the new no-no's.

New no-no.

What time?

Oh.

Drag him.

You know that annoying coworker of yours goes into the break room?

Sides to cook something up and it stinks real bad.

I hate this guy.

I hate you.

You know what?

I got a deal for you.

New no-no.

If you cook something stinky where I work, I'm going to cook something stinky where I live.

Just sit in my house.

And thanks.

And there's nothing you can do about it.

Oh and the worst part?

You don't even know it's happening.

New no-no.

I eat stink.

Yeah.

New no-no.

Have you ever had people go, do you want to look at a picture of my kid?

Oh my I hate that.

Oh I've done that.

Yeah.

What are you looking at?

Oh okay.

Yeah.

I'll look at a picture of your kid.

If you look at a picture of me dressed as your kid.

And guess what?

I already got it.

Ready and loaded.

How'd you get the kids clothes?

Shopping.

I assume they're their grown person size reproductions of the clothes.

Not the actual clothes.

No.

The same size.

I twist.

I cram.

I fifth.

New no-no.

I twist.

I cram my thick.

Yeah.

Okay.

Look out.

New no-no.

You know these people who slurp their food?

Oh.

So annoyed.

Okay you like slurping?

Slurp everything.

What?

You got a slurp chicken.

You got a slurp turkey.

You got a slurp ham.

You got a no-no.

Throw clearers.

There were the slurpers.

Okay.

How about this?

Every time you clear a throat, I pee in my pants a little bit.

You're annoying.

Drivel dribble.

Yeah, I'm just peeing my pants.

And guess what?

It's uncomfortable for me.

Not you.

No-no-no.

You made me pee my pants tonight.

Yes.

Any more of my good bitch?

I don't know.

I don't think the PC thought police will let me.

No, come on.

We're going to let you.

We're going to let you go.

Let's restart that clock.

Okay.

Restart that clock.

It starts the clock.

Don't spoil anything.

That's what people say all the time.

La la la.

Plugging my ears.

Don't- Okay.

Well, I'm sorry.

I'm going to spoil everything for you people.

In the sixth sense, Bruce Willis is in it.

Whoa!

Go back.

Rest the sixth sense and give it a watch.

Cause Bruce Willis is in it.

No-no-no.

Bruce Willis is an actor and he plays a character in the sixth sense.

Yes.

He takes the shit in it too.

If you see it, if you can catch him.

In the middle of the movie.

Throughout the movie.

No-no, my bad.

My bad.

Oh, I'm so sick of this expression.

My bad.

Everyone uses it constantly.

No-no, my bad.

It's now my bat.

Huh?

And is it a baseball bat?

Is it a vampire bat?

I'm not going to tell you.

You'll have to find out when you say it.

And the person hands it to you.

No-no-no.

My bat.

And then they give you a bat.

Do we have to carry around bats?

To give to people when they say it?

Check your lockers after the show, guys.

Whoa!

Full of bats.

Any more?

Express lanes.

Oh, turn up that clock.

Oh my god.

You go to the grocery store, what do they say?

Ten items are left.

Big up items are left.

Ten, twelve, eight, eight.

Fifteen some time.

Okay, so if it's up to fifteen, let me get this straight.

Okay, let me do the math.

Does that mean I can bring in?

Five?

Yes.

Does that mean I can bring in?

Nine?

Well, you could probably just breeze right through the line.

Could I just bring in one?

Yes.

Are these real questions?

Okay, deal.

I'll bring in less than fifteen.

Great, that seems like a little bit of a problem.

You can also bring in fifteen, because it's fifteen or less.

Oh, but I can't bring in sixteen?

No.

Sure.

You probably could bring in sixteen.

I think they'd notice.

I feel like this is less of a new no-no when you asking us how these lines go.

How did these work?

Okay.

Low talkers, close talkers, high talkers.

You've never seen Seinfeld.

No, no, no, watch Seinfeld.

Yum, who depends.

It's fun, too.

Social media.

Cast in a wide net.

I've got it up to here.

I think he's moved on.

Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snore, Snore, Snore.

It's a what's that up?

That sounds good.

Snore, snore, snore, snore.

Snore, snore, snore.

There's four.

You gotta write them, even though you only say three.

Whoa, I love that.

I'm downloading that now.

What?

What's with social media?

No, I don't wanna look at a picture of your sandwich.

Okay?

Maybe, you know what?

You want me to eat the sandwich?

Is that why you're showing it to me?

Then I'll pretend to eat it.

Every time I look at one of your sandwiches, I'll put down my phone.

I don't pant them, I'm holding the sandwich.

And spend 20 minutes at least eating it.

Is that what you want?

So you, what?

Is that, are you done?

What was that the, the music faded out?

Fellas, put the toilet seat down.

Ah!

Yes!

By your name!

I agree.

Thank you, thank you.

Oh, sorry, I had to get that off.

I had a rope being my bonnet.

Oh, good stuff.

It's really grinding my gears there.

Oh my gosh.

I'm allergic to bees.

They are musicians and also geologists.

Wow, that, what an exciting combination.

Please welcome Bashford and Franklin.

How you doing?

Oh, Scott, thank you for having us.

Oh, you're quite welcome.

It's my pleasure to have entertainers of any stripe here on the show.

So, and you fit into that perfectly because you are musicians.

But I think what's also interesting about you is you're also geologists.

So it's my pleasure to have you on and thank you for appearing.

Thank you so much.

Thank you.

For having us, Scott.

We're so happy to be here.

Are you happy to be here?

I am happy to be here, Bashford.

I'm happy to be here too.

Okay, so you're Bashford.

I'm Bashford.

And you're Franklin.

Yes.

We are a married couple.

Oh, you're a married couple.

Yes.

Okay, that wasn't in your bio.

It should read musicians.

We don't want people to- Slash married couples.

We want to be known under our own merits, okay?

Oh, I see.

Because you think people would judge you differently if they knew you were married?

Absolutely.

Why did you say it right off the bat then?

This patriarchal society- Sure.

always gives the male more credit in the workplace- Sure.

behind the music boards.

So what you're saying is you think that Franklin wouldn't be given her due- No.

Because they would assume that you just pulled her up into this business.

Absolutely.

But if you don't know you're married, then people will assume- We're equals.

You're equals.

Great.

Much like Claudia and Paul over here.

Yes.

Oh my God.

Equals.

I see- Am I equal to you, Paul?

I thought you were my boss.

No, you're a double me.

Yes.

That's not a- Like W?

W?

Yeah, I just got the- It was sent to me in the mail this morning.

I found out.

Okay, great.

You ever see that movie, W?

Not gonna do it.

Kevin, can't say that I have.

I saw that movie.

I loved it.

I thought Josh Brolin did a great job as George W. Bush.

He did, didn't he?

He did.

Yeah.

Just a spitting image.

He endeared him in my heart because I was quite upset.

You were upset at George W.

Between the years of 2000 and 2008, I was quite upset.

The entire eight years you were upset?

The entire eight years I was in a state- He didn't get out of bed.

He didn't get out of bed.

What did that do to your mental health?

My God.

Oh, that made it worse.

Oh, yeah.

Well, I didn't know.

He was a byproduct of his mental health.

Oh.

He loves his hands.

But now I'm back.

You're out of bed.

You're on stage.

Oh, yeah.

And was it the movie W that got you out of bed?

The movie W got me out of bed.

Wow.

Once he became a human to me and indeed himself to me.

He's fine.

He loves baseball.

He pays.

Oh, he pays.

Oh, there he is.

Do you own any of his paintings now?

Yeah, we have a whole room.

We have a whole room of George W. Bush paintings.

Mm-hmm.

And all painted by Josh Brolin as George W. Bush.

Okay, wow.

Those are even more rare.

Mm-hmm.

Because he'll, there were only like probably 27 scenes where he was painting in that movie.

Yep.

And we have all, we have 26 to 27 of those.

Wow.

Who has the 27?

The cut one.

I don't know.

I'm not exactly sure.

Who do you think has the 27th?

You got to track that down.

I was somebody in, I think I saw somebody in Ghana had it.

In Ghana?

On Etsy.

I was looking on Etsy.

Not Ghana do it.

Not gonna do it.

Oh, Scott, I love you.

That might be George H.W. Bush.

But, so you guys are singers.

Yes.

As well as, I assume you said musicians, but you sing.

Sing, yes.

Both singers and songwriters.

You sing, you do it on each one of your songs or do you take turns?

Do we ever.

We do it on each one of our songs because we only have one song.

Oh honey, oh let's do it.

Oh yes.

Start, say why don't you start it off for us.

Wait a minute, you say you only have one song?

We only have one.

And you're gonna do it now?

And it's a cover.

I don't know the way we're set up for the do.

Do you do the music?

No, I don't know.

Okay.

Do we have access to the music?

We can do it on CoPella.

Let's do it on CoPella.

Alright, go ahead.

Yeah.

Do you start a soft baby?

Oh, you're gonna take a walk?

You're gonna take a walk?

You don't even know.

Who starts?

You want me to take your part today?

Yeah.

Okay.

How about I just start at my line when I come here?

Okay baby.

Not right away.

There was no time to play.

We built it up.

And built it up.

And now we're solid.

Solid as a rock.

Oh, honey, I did the Baroque version.

You did the Baroque version?

You said solid as Baroque.

Oh, okay.

Oh my God.

Let's take it back.

Okay.

Now start from my part again.

Okay.

So wait, you guys are doing a cover of solid as a rock.

But you forgot and it was solid as Baroque.

Okay.

So now you need to start over.

I just want to be on the same page.

Yeah.

Okay.

Oh, hey, right?

Where are my favorite ones?

Five, six, seven, eight.

There was no time to play.

We built it up.

And built it up.

And now we're solid.

A.

Solid as a rock.

Did you say Baroque again?

What?

I don't know what keeps getting into me.

Okay.

I was looking at your lip.

I was reading your lips.

Much like George H.W.

But yeah, don't.

Solid as George Bush.

We have our political differences.

I will say that.

Oh, really?

What are your differences?

I like Baroque.

And I like Michelle.

It's not that different.

So you liked the first lady.

You both supported the administration.

And I liked the first man.

Right.

But still, you have to like the other one.

Did you, you like the other person in the marriage, right?

I have no qualms.

Bow the dog.

Bow.

They have a dog named Bow.

They did have Bow.

I like Sasha.

Michelle's brother is the basketball coach at Oregon State University.

Good bit of trivia.

So you guys feel like you have big political differences.

It's huge.

We did not get along.

You know, the other day we got into a fight over our political differences.

I stayed in bed for weeks.

He wouldn't get out of bed.

I said Michelle was fine.

I said she was fine.

He wouldn't speak to me.

He wouldn't look at me.

One look.

One look wouldn't speak.

I closed my eyes and shut my mouth.

Close his eyes and shut my mouth.

And but now we're solid.

Can I?

Solid.

That's...

Barak, right.

Can I ask you guys a question?

You say your musicians.

Yes.

We don't say we are.

We are.

You are musicians.

Yes we are.

But you only halfway know one song.

What?

You don't even know who starts it.

You can't even get the lyrics right.

And it's not your song.

You didn't write it.

That's why we don't know who starts it.

Okay sure.

Yeah.

But it's a cover that we use.

We go around the town.

And every town we do a dig in.

We sing this song at the dig site.

It's like a coronation of the dig.

Oh I see.

Okay.

Which brings us to the geologist part of it.

Yes.

So you guys are geologists.

You're scientists.

We are.

Are you married geologists as well?

We're married.

We're geologists and we sing.

But we don't tell anybody that we're married on the digs.

Really.

And I don't know if anybody does.

See I'll paint you out because society.

I don't believe that she will get the credit for being a better digger than I am.

I am a better digger.

He's an okay digger.

I'm an okay digger.

Okay.

Well you guys obviously know what you're talking about because geologists call each other diggers all the time.

Me.

That's my digger.

Okay.

I wasn't going to say that.

You were thinking.

You weren't thinking.

Yes.

That's my digger.

Okay.

Look.

Guys.

How did you get into the science of geology?

Well I got into it because I was studying communications at University of Wisconsin-Ashkosh.

Not Big Ash.

Just University of Wisconsin-Ashkosh.

That's a community college.

Okay.

Yes.

What's the mask out there?

Overall.

Just overalls.

Like a sentient pair of overalls.

They walk around town.

They go to the basketball games.

Do they have a time they lose?

They unbuckle.

It's like the flap of the overalls like the mouth.

Yes.

Right.

It talks.

Okay.

Good.

Go.

Ashkosh.

Not Big Ash.

Right.

And something was weird under the ground of my dormitory.

And so I began to dig and dig and dig and dig and sit.

What's your found baby?

I found a pot of gold.

What?

How could you tell what was weird about it?

Every time I walked, I'm so glad you asked Claudia.

Every time I walked, I walked over the carpet and there was always a hump in the carpet.

Oh.

And I was on the ground floor.

I said why is this hump in my ground floor?

So I took a box cutter and I cut open the carpet and then I saw that the ground under it had shifted.

Okay.

Was it a concrete underneath?

Concrete.

But it was broken.

Oh it was broken.

Oh interesting.

The concrete.

So it's carpet on concrete.

It was carpet on top of concrete.

A concrete.

A very hard floor.

There's probably a carpet pad on that as well.

None.

No carpet.

Just carpet concrete.

What?

This is the first time hearing of this.

This floor was solid.

Hey.

Solid as Barak.

Okay.

That's what this floor is.

The carpet's still hot.

I'm just getting by the way that you're singing solid as a rock in your geology.

I'm catching up to that right now.

Twist.

This is like when I found out that Bruce Willis was in the sixth sense.

Ooh, spoiler.

Those were all things.

What a twist.

Scagged.

So those were all things.

I haven't seen that movie.

So how did you dig into the concrete?

I took a spoon.

Oh.

Like prison style.

Like Shawshank Redemption style.

Did you know that Bruce Willis was in there?

No, I didn't stop spoiling movies for me.

I'm sorry.

Is that a normal tool for a digger?

In prison?

Yes.

Okay.

Yeah.

So you weren't in prison though.

I was in prison.

They had in prison to you in this college.

No, no, no.

I could leave and go as I...

But they did put you out for breaking the floor of the Tuomatore.

They put me out of college.

But at this point you have a pot of gold.

What do you need college for?

Exactly, Scott.

You caught right on.

So had a leprechaun left it there?

Or was it literally in a pot?

Or was it...

Much gold as could fit in a pot.

It was in a pot?

Like did you use to cook oatmeal or some other hot breakfast cereal?

Molotow meow pot?

Like a hot pot?

And it was in the pot, had a handle?

Not to be mistaken for a crock pot.

Mmm.

Not to be mistaken for a sock hop.

Okay, well I promise I will.

Not to be mistaken for a hot block.

I will not mistake any of those things.

Sometimes the block is hot.

So you have this pot full of gold.

Did you ever find out who's it was?

I didn't.

But the pot stayed hot.

And when I saw it...

I said the pot is still hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot.

So then how did you get into geology if I may ask Franklin?

You see I was living below him in the dormitory.

What?

I was...

So this is on the second floor.

She lived in the basement.

Oh.

Okay.

So you dug into the floor but it was really your roof.

Yes.

And you see I was bleaching my hair.

And I started getting concrete in the dye.

I stomped upstairs.

I said what is the big idea?

Right.

And were you...

I have to ask is this pot of gold was it your possession?

It was.

It was mine.

So.

It was mine.

And this is news to you.

But this is news to me.

Because you're alert.

Stop spoiling our love.

I put it in the ceiling.

I put it in the ceiling because I thought it would be secure.

And people always put things in a mattress in the floor.

But no one ever looks up.

But no one ever thinks into looking in the ceiling.

Yeah.

It's like that movie taken if she had like a hid up on the ceiling.

She wouldn't have gotten dragged up.

Please don't spoil it.

I'm sorry.

The sneeze is in it though.

Also that movie 54.

The boss of the studio 54 hid all of his tax evaded money in the roof.

Mike Myers.

Yes.

Claudia.

Yes.

Come through.

I did.

Mike Myers.

Yes.

I went up there.

I said, what's the big idea?

I'm trying to dye my hair.

And I said, this man, this man is solid.

Solid.

Well, Scott.

I think you're pardoned by just Scott.

Scott.

It felt like you were leading his hair.

Scott.

Without dramatic pause.

Do you think Scott?

I've been known to carry a dude.

Oh.

You're carrying it all right.

Straight to hell.

Look.

You guys only know one song.

Oh, but we sing that song.

But we sing it to this guy's in heaven.

And it's on tune on key upon pitch.

All right.

I said, this man looks solid.

I said what's the big idea?

I had been lifting a lot of weights.

I was on the I. Scott's football team.

Oh, OK.

So you guys got into a fight, but then you said you were solid.

I said he was solid.

He looked me dead in my eyes and said, what color are you dyeing your hair?

I said blonde.

And I said that color is solid.

Solid has no rock.

Oh my God.

OK, so you thought he was solid, but that didn't lead you into the song.

It took you.

It was no, it didn't.

It didn't.

It was just a moment.

It took him thinking that your hair color was solid.

We looked each other and I, you know, from that moment, I haven't spent a day without him since.

Really, not even one day.

Even all those days in bed.

No, she came in and watched me.

She sat at the foot of the bed.

I said, I said, I'm not going to do anything until you do something.

I said, it's going to be a while.

So how long ago was it that you met?

It was pre 2000.

It was 1934.

Wow.

Oh, you guys are old.

I know I know.

We are quite old.

I had no idea.

Incredible.

Yes, black doesn't crack.

But I tell you what does.

What?

The floor.

And the floor.

Number three.

So good.

This.

Oh boy, I love hearing those guys laugh through their appearance.

We were all having a great time.

It was a great episode.

That was really fun.

And I think because it's called solid as a rock and they sing it so many times, I think also a lot of people voted for it because I mean, it's a great episode, but also very recognizable title.

Very recognizable title.

I knew exactly what it was.

All right, let's go to a break.

When we come back, we're going to be doing the top two episodes of the year.

Paul, what could they be?

Don't even guess.

Do you really want to?

Yeah, I really want to.

What do you got?

Better not tell you no.

All right, let's hear it on the other side.

We'll be right back with comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang.

Back here, best of 2018, part four.

And it is the new year.

It's the new year.

Truly is.

Welcome to 2019.

2019.

The queer vlogo.

2019.

The fungal of man makes the night one of me.

Steely Dan.

The fifth character of comedy bang bang.

New York City, of course.

Yes.

I'm sorry, New York City's fifth character.

Oh, okay.

Steely Dan's new?

Yeah.

They're number six on the call sheet.

That's right.

Collectively, though.

You me.

Walter Fagan and no, Donald Fagan and Walter Becker are not separate there.

Walter Fagan's also there.

Well, he's a fagan from Oliver.

Fagan from Oliver.

He's one of the power bottles.

I believe.

York.

And then Steely Dan.

I think so.

Welcome back.

We are counting.

We're up to the top two.

You've got to be a buttermo too.

Bill Sykes.

He's a top.

He's a top for sure.

He's a top.

Let's go through all the data.

We did that on a previous episode.

As many as we could remember.

All right.

We got to get to this countdown.

Don't we?

I mean, what are we waiting for?

I think we owe it to the audience.

We owe it to the world.

Let's do it.

Let's go to this is your episode number two.

Number two.

All right.

Episode number two.

Now this has to be better than the previous episode.

It's got to be right.

But not as good as the next one.

Exactly.

All right.

So this is episode 543.

I just want to preface this by saying.

Yes.

If I'm not on this episode.

Oh boy.

Here it comes.

I'm going to be furious.

Hulk mashup.

Well, we'll see.

Okay.

This is episode 543.

So we're still in the 500s.

That's good.

Okay.

This is an episode called the ninth anniversary show.

Paul, you are in this.

That was a close one.

Whew.

Please don't say that before the next episode.

We know by the way.

What?

No, no, no.

Let's see.

The people.

Okay.

This was our ninth anniversary.

We started this show back in 2009 about April 30th or May 1st.

I can't recall what the first one was.

But one of those days.

And this is nine years later.

We did episode 543.

Let's talk about who came.

First of all, let's talk about who came to the episode that we do.

First of all, those men, Sean Clemens and Hayes Davenport were recording their own show and were leaving.

And I said, hey, come on over and do the top of our show.

Don't say the whole time.

But do the very top of our show.

And they were nice enough to do that.

So they.

Nice enough not to say the whole time.

Exactly.

Thanks guys.

But we have PFT over here.

Lauren Lapkus, Sean Diston, Zeke Nicholson, Ego Wodem, and Madeline Walter are all here.

Now this is here's.

Okay.

This is the ninth anniversary and I wanted to shake it up a little and have some of the recent people who were doing such a good job on the show.

The Reeple.

Yes.

You know, you got Sean Diston playing Rudy North who, you know, made such a big splash.

Zeke Nicholson, who's been a great recent addition to the show, Ego, who had been on for maybe six months at this point or nine months.

And Madeline, who is another great performer who I lost to Brooklyn Nine-Nine as well, who has not been able to be on the show in nine months or so.

That's right.

Fucking show goes on.

Didn't that show get canceled?

Yeah, it did.

What is this?

What are we doing now?

Crazy.

There's no rules anymore.

It's like a real Hogan family.

You got Valerie then the Hogan family.

So this is a really fun show.

We all got together and these, these anniversary shows are like just big, you know, fun.

Anything goes, types of episodes where everyone is talking and trying to talk over each other.

And I put out the invite to a bunch of people and see who can come.

And I'm always blessed with a wonderful turnout.

So this one, and this one was really great to me because of course, you know, I had to have you and Lauren there as cornerstones of the show.

But even Lauren was a new addition for, you know, maybe four years ago.

She was one of these new people.

So that's what I'm, I'm trying to always bring new people into the fold and get new performers on.

So this one was really- And you're trying to push older people out?

Yes.

Out the door.

I'm keeping that door open and joking.

Nice flow, Grandpa.

So this one was fun for me because it had a lot of the new people, a great mix of the old people and the new people.

So let me tell you what we're about to hear.

Now in the episode, previous to these clips, you and Lauren are playing Emily, grandchildren and Dirk Nasty.

And you are, you work for the RC Cola Corporation who owns my show somehow.

The RC Cola Corporation owns Scripps, which owns mid-roll, which owns my book.

Which ones comedy bang bang.

So you're here from corporate on my ninth anniversary to check out the show and see if I'm doing a good job.

Yes.

So that happens before these clips.

And then- No.

But it was, it was good.

I'm sure.

You can only check out so many clips.

Yeah, yeah.

Now I'm not good enough for clip.

Okay.

Come on.

But then we talked to Rudy North.

Now we heard Rudy North earlier in our countdown in his first appearance and he had one in between that and this and his catchphrases are evolving and he is coming up with new stuff.

So- This is when we find out he's in the speed force, right?

Yes.

And by the way, if you don't know who Rudy North is, don't worry, he recaps his character every time he appears.

So we didn't, yes, we do find out about the speed force in this one.

And then in between that clip and the next one, Zeke Nicholson playing Kiwi Chris comes by.

So if you hear an Australian character or something that sounds like it's trying to be an Australian character.

That is New Zealand.

New Zealand, right.

That is Kiwi Chris.

And we have Ego playing Entre P. Newer is the character that she debuts.

That's right.

People really want Entre P. Newer to come back along with, I believe she mentions her brother.

Oh, yeah.

So we're going to see what we can do about that if I can get Ego to come in here whenever SNL is not around.

So we're going to hear- SNL is not around.

I'm not around.

We're at SNL though.

I don't know.

It's not around.

It just disappeared.

It's not bad.

It's like a bit of 43 year.

Yeah.

There's no explanation.

It just knows it's just one day it's like it's March.

Like an SNL have come back from break.

Right up to the live show on Saturday.

So they're working on a show all week.

Right.

And then when it comes time for Saturday, no one's in the building.

Just no one's there and the cameras are gone and everyone's like, where does SNL go?

Yeah.

I don't know.

SNL is not around.

SNL disappeared.

I would love that.

I'd like it to.

Well, it's just so weird.

Yeah.

What's weird about it?

That it's just been there for so long or?

What's weird about it?

You know it's what's weird about it.

All right.

I know what's weird about it.

I just want to hear you say it.

Stop.

Well, because there's not many other live shows besides like the news.

You know what I mean?

Football.

That would be another weird one.

It's just like football.

We're building up to the- Are you ready for some football?

Well, sorry.

And then no, the teams aren't here.

We don't know where they are.

They're not here, man.

The teams aren't here, man.

I like every show should be live, I think.

Agreed.

To disagreed.

All right.

Let's hear these clips.

These are some really fun ones.

Of course, we can't play the entire episode because it's like two and a half hours.

Let's just do it.

Let's hear these clips though.

This is your episode two.

Number two.

Our producer is handing me a sheet here and everyone is a surprise to me today.

So let's see who we have here.

Oh, well, this is very exciting.

It reads here fan favorite.

He's been on the show several times, but only recently.

Yeah, that's right.

Only approximately the last five, six months.

Yeah, he's catching on.

Quit this guy.

Yeah, Rudy North is here.

Rudy North, professional employee, Rudy North.

Professional employee and friend favorite.

Scott, I need to get this out of the way, right?

Oh, really?

You don't want to meet our other- Oh, I'll get to these two in a second.

Okay, but you have to get something off your chest, Rudy.

Welcome back to the show.

Thank you, Scott.

No time for formalities or post-and-free's though.

No, I got to get to this right away, Scott.

You got to get to it.

Okay, let there be no more dalliances, please.

Scott, let's go ahead and do a recap previously on Comedy Bank Bank.

I am a dirtbag.

I life-swapped a guy, took his job at Postmates.

Got fired for Postmates for punch people in the throat.

Right.

Then I life-swapped a guy at Target.

He took his job at security.

Right.

Got fired for punch people in the throat.

Right.

Then, at the end of the last show, I took Engineer Cody's job with a life-swap.

He's no longer here at your world.

He's no longer here, but I haven't seen you around.

I was immediately fired.

Oh, okay.

I punched Engineer Brett in the throat.

Oh, no.

Brett, is that true?

You don't get on that.

Yeah, you've noticed.

He can't be him.

He can't talk anymore.

His throat is fucked up.

Oh, is that why?

Oh, my gosh.

I- you've been like gesturing the- Please give me the heimlich.

He does that on that now.

He's a comfort thing for him.

Yeah.

It's like a thunder blanket for a dog.

Right.

Yeah.

Okay, so that catches us up?

Yes, that catches you up.

Because as far as I recall, you were also a magical being who- That's not important, Scott.

Scott, I'm here to talk about my employment.

And Scott, I got a new job.

You got a new job.

That's right, Scott.

Okay.

Well, I was fired from your wolf, of course.

Of course you were.

Of course.

All right.

Now, I was walking through a park.

Just the other day.

Okay.

And there was a guy- I heard the sound and it was a loud.

Describe the sound, please.

The sound, it was loud.

Okay, well, sounds are normally varying volumes.

It was loud.

So this was at the upper end of the- It was a tonal sound.

Oh, okay.

So the music- So the tone- It was like a tone- Can I give you an example of what it sounded like?

Yes, please.

It sounded like this.

That kind of sound.

So sort of like- Singing.

It was like singing, but it was coming from an engine, a motor.

And I walked over to it and I saw a man holding a leaf blower, Scott.

Okay, this is very confusing.

Let me try to figure this out.

You heard a sound like singing.

Yes.

It was coming from a motor.

And that motor.

That was a- In the car?

A motor.

It was a leaf blower, Scott.

Oh, I think I know what's going on here.

And correct me if I'm wrong.

Is this a Flintstone situation where the leaf blower was a living creature?

Like a dinosaur?

Who was singing?

You know what?

If this was prehistoric times, it might have been.

But this was current times.

But this was current times we had the machines.

Look, can I ask you a question?

Yeah.

You noticed it was from a motor before it was from a leaf blower.

I have a keen sense of hearing, Scott.

Oh, okay.

Based on my time- Yeah, but you heard it was singing.

Based on what?

I'm sorry.

Based on my time on this earth?

Okay.

Oh, okay.

But I heard it was a singing- We've all had time on this earth.

So why should yours be my marquee?

And you're very good.

Yeah.

I'm very old, but we don't have time to get it to this.

Oh, that's right.

You're hundreds of years old.

I'm hundreds of years old.

Scott.

Yes.

I punch this guy in a throat.

The guy holding the leaf blower?

Yep.

Took his leaf blower.

Okay.

Took his job, took his life.

Okay.

What was his job?

Leaf blower.

Oh, okay.

I thought that might be something he was doing on the weekend.

No, no, no.

He's a leaf blower.

He's okay.

He works for the city of Los Angeles.

Okay.

I'm happy to say that I'm a happy employee for the city of Los Angeles.

I'm a leaf blower.

Oh, my gosh.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

I really appreciate that.

Rudy North, you finally have found a job and...

What could be a career?

Now, Scott, a lot of people...

Now, you're calling a career and I appreciate that because a lot of people look down on leaf blowers and they say, is that even a job is very easy?

Well, I would assume no one would do that unless they were getting paid for it.

Well, yeah.

I mean, or they were trying to, you know, do the upkeep of their own property.

But, Scott.

I'm not sure if they being a leaf blower is akin to being an architect.

Okay.

How do you mean like, I'm trying to think of architects that I've met?

Architects!

Mr. Brady.

Mr. Brady is the only famous example of an architect.

Frazier.

Frazier was an architect?

I think.

Caroline in the city.

She drew buildings.

She drew buildings?

She drew buildings.

Wait, was she a cartoonist?

Ten nights from too close for comfort.

She also drew buildings.

Okay.

I feel like Frazier was a call-in radio host.

I feel like he might have been...

But I might be wrong.

I don't know anything about how the Frazier cranes.

Your last name is Crane.

You don't work with them.

Oh shit.

You know what?

He was an architect.

I'm a little confused by the sound that this leaf blower made.

Are you on me doing it again?

Yeah.

Well, no, but it sounds like a human being singing?

Well, Scott, I'm not...

That was pretty good.

Oh, that was a sneeze?

Gis a tiger.

It's one of the things that caused us to work together.

We realized around the office.

Oh, no, no, no.

We both...

You instantly harmonized.

Wow, now I got a good ear.

I couldn't hear over my own sneeze.

I was sneezing.

I guess any two different notes are harmony in a certain chord.

Hey, you're the music expert, Scott.

I'm just the leaf blower expert.

Are you?

I guess Scott's criticizing how we...

I'm not criticizing at all.

I was more criticizing what Rudy said.

Well, hold up.

If you're going to criticize anything, criticize these nuts.

Who?

My dear fellow.

Well, I'm just saying, Scott.

Wait, did you say that because your nuts are crittersized?

Those are big possums.

I got big nuts and if you're going to crittersize anything, you've got to crittersize by a duck.

No, Scott, you're not respect to me, Scott, because I'm telling you that, leaf blowering is...

Don't punch me on the throat.

I'm not going to punch you on the throat.

All right.

Dirt bass, hey, shake.

I'm not going to taunt you on the throat.

No.

No, Scott.

Were you a genie or something?

No, I was not a genie.

No, yes, I might have a similar voice to a genie that might have appeared on the throat.

So don't we all?

Don't we all have similar voices?

I know, I sound like a genie.

I sound like many people.

What was your...

But I'm trying to...

You always come in here and you never...

Scott...

You say we never had time to talk about your backstory.

I'm worried we're getting into the, you know, the intricacies of leaf blowing when I'm really interested in the...

How could you be interested in the...

You're immortal?

Okay, Scott, I'm immortal.

I wasn't born into a human body.

I was born in 1600.

These are things that we all know.

Can we talk about leaf blowing?

All right, go ahead.

Scott, look, it's your show.

I don't think you understand.

It's his show.

I'm already...

It's your time.

It is my time.

The floor is yours is what I need to say.

Thank you, Scott.

This forum is mine and I want to talk about the importance of blowing leaves.

The importance of it.

Yes.

Now, when I ask a wild...

The importance of blowing leaves, I ask a wild.

Where do they go?

Any time I see someone blowing leaves around, I'm like...

It's like when you go in, there's an air dryer in the public restroom.

Where does the water go?

It's just like flicking it around, you know, onto the floor.

It evaporates.

Yeah, and that situation it evaporates.

But with leaves...

So do leaves are evaporated?

Can't you just absolutely see where those leaves go?

Oh, it just seems like they're just flying around and then it's like...

Exactly right.

They're no longer on my property anymore.

They're on someone else's.

Yeah, my job is to get leaves off of sidewalks and get them onto people's shoes and faces.

And to sort of get them so that people can walk down the sidewalk and be like, wow, this is clean, but...

Ooh, it smells like mulch.

There's bugs everywhere.

And somebody's sort of swished around all this dirt with air and didn't really do anything.

Right.

I mean, so you're just like blowing leaves onto someone's face so they look like Gene Simmons in his Kiss Makeup or something?

That's my favorite thing to do.

Mm-hmm.

Blow it in leaves or people's face.

So they look like Gene Simmons in the Kiss Makeup.

Very specific.

Scott, you should be a leaf blower, man.

I'm very happy in my current position.

Yeah, you know what?

I don't know if you have the skills to blow leaves.

Yeah, what are the skills involved?

I mean, it seems like you pick up a thing and then you pointed at something.

You have to turn it on.

Is that about it?

You've never leaf blown before, Scott?

I don't believe I ever have.

No, I...

That was some expert shit right there.

I mean, damn, you pick...

So you pick it up and then you turn it on.

You're pretty good, Scott.

I'm very disappointed.

You know what?

Man, leaf blow is pretty easy.

Yeah.

I mean, it's a very low paying job.

I mean, I'm sure there are people out there.

I mean, I don't think there's anyone out there listening to podcasts while they leaf blow.

I think it would be impossible.

No, that's crazy.

So, you know, I don't think I'm insulting anyone.

No, no, no.

But it's a very low paying, low wage job that, you know, people don't want to stay in for a long period of time usually.

Can I ask you a question, Scott?

Sure.

How much money you make?

Uh...

That's a good question.

This is interesting.

I've never asked you that before.

Yeah, I said like this.

I mean, it fluctuates.

Here's the problem is when you're in show business jobs come and go and fluctuate so much.

Give me an average of the last three years.

Of the last three, I would have to take a look at my tax returns.

I don't have them easily accessible to be.

Can you make any of the key track of it?

This is interesting.

Well, that is interesting.

This isn't a rude question.

I feel like this question doesn't normally...

You put the rude and rudey north, my friend.

Funny rhyme.

That's a funny rhyme.

That is a funny rhyme.

That is quite good.

So, how much money do you make?

Well, I mean...

What are we paying you?

You guys should have this information more than anyone.

We should do.

We just want to know how you interpret it.

In dollars.

Oh, okay.

Wow.

You were troubled, I was kind of interested.

How old are you?

What are you making a note of that?

Look, Rudy, why are you here?

Not to quote the Beastie Boys, but why are you here?

It's supposed to be pretzel.

I did want to tell you about my new job, but I did have some other news I need to deliver to you.

But then we can move on and we don't need to.

Okay, this is news about yourself or news about me.

It's kind of news about myself, but it's news about everybody.

It's news about everybody.

Okay.

Scott...

I'm sorry, everybody in the world?

Or everybody here.

Everyone who's ever existed.

Ever existed?

Was it dead?

Yeah, look, Scott, from the first caveman that took a lightning strike to a tree branch and decided like, oh, that keeps me warm.

He's affected too, Scott.

Oh my gosh.

The first caveman that took a lightning strike to a tree branch.

To a tree branch.

And said, oh, that keeps me warm.

You guys think that's a weird question?

I got it.

Scott, your actual name is slot ockerman.

We're living in a flashpoint-esque scenario where I've traveled back in time and changed the future.

Yeah.

Little details have changed in everyone's lives.

It's just like the buttercream effect.

It's like the buttercream effect, Scott.

Oh, no.

So yeah, your name is Scott now.

It's Scott now, but it used to be slot?

It used to be slot ockerman.

I don't know.

What was my name?

You turned back.

Oh, your name was Mrs. Grandkids.

Mrs. Grandkids, not Miss Grandchildren?

No, Miss Grandkids.

What was my name?

Oh, your name?

Dick thirsty.

I'll stick with Dirk.

Okay, yeah.

Okay, but was Miss Grandchildren married to Stephen King in the previous?

She was married to Stephen Prince.

Stephen Prince.

Yeah.

Scott, I don't really want to explain all the different- Oh, the differences.

Was Stephen King's name Stephen Prince before?

Or was it a totally different person?

When you go back that far in time, it's hard to kind of predict the outcomes.

So yeah, it's hard.

How far back did you go in order to exchange those?

I went back before humans existed.

Whoa, the primordial ooze.

I think you have a lot of other guests, Scott.

And I feel like we shouldn't really get too far into this.

How did you do it?

How did you achieve it?

Because as far as I know, you're just an immortal.

Oh yeah, I can run really fast like the Flash.

Just like the DC Comics Flash.

Okay, so you can't time travel in terms of just like if you wanted to, you'd have to run really fast.

I run really fast backwards in time.

I have the same powers as the Flash.

Every single power?

Yep.

I can phase through stuff.

I could also make duplicates of myself when I vibrate really fast.

Okay.

And can you bring other people into the speed force and how about the experience?

Oh yeah.

I would love to experience it.

The speed force?

Yeah, let me get in there.

Hold on.

Oh my God, that was amazing.

Yeah, that was crazy.

That was like three years we were in there.

What did you say to the speed force?

I don't know.

It didn't talk back so I just...

Yeah, he said a lot of stuff.

But Scott, we had a lot of fun times in there.

That was really fun.

I feel like I mean, you're my best friend.

I love you for the last three years.

How long were we gone?

Was it like two years?

Why are you guys still here?

I can't believe it.

Oh, we've been...

The time stopped over here, I guess.

It was just like a millisecond to us.

Oh my God.

That's right, Scott.

Rudy and I have experienced so much.

He told me his whole backstory.

Yeah.

I learned everything about him.

Hello, Scott.

Now that you know the backstory, let's not start telling people.

It's boring.

Yeah.

I don't want to hear it.

You've kind of heard.

So much about it.

I don't have any information about them other than their name.

But please welcome to the show Entre P. Newer.

How are you doing?

Hi.

Hi, Entre.

How are you?

I'm good.

How are you?

I'm good.

Call me by my full name, please.

Entre P. Newer?

Yes.

My mother didn't name me Entre P. Newer for nothing.

Wow.

Okay.

I beg your pardon.

I guess it's a custom in human beings to only call someone by half their name.

Well, I'm not like other human beings.

I'm an Entre P. Newer.

This must have come up so many times in your life.

I'm not sure why you're so upset about it right now.

Because I'm hot.

All right.

I'm hot.

You're coming in hot here.

I'm coming in hot.

It's hot outside.

I'm hot inside.

Okay.

It's so nice to meet you.

I'm Scott.

I'm the host of the show.

Good to meet you.

We've never met before.

Scott last name of the original.

I beg your pardon.

Scott David Ockerman.

Good to meet you.

Okay.

This is Kiwi Chris.

I believe that's his full name.

Oh, yeah.

Good to meet you.

Rudy North of course.

I know that's his full name.

Great.

I'm sorry, but it was 18 years ago.

Do you show me?

You just reminded that never came up in the last 18 years.

Sorry.

Andre, how you doing?

Excuse me.

Who are you talking to?

Andre P. Nure.

I'm good.

And who are these two?

This is Dirk Thirsty.

I'm Dirk Thirsty.

And Emily Grandchildren.

They're from corporate.

They work for RC Cola.

We're here to monitor the show and we're going to report back on what we hear.

You work for corporate, you say?

Yeah.

Okay.

Are you looking to invest in some businesses?

Oh.

Sorry, they just sneezed.

Oh, sorry.

I'm like a leaf blower for a second.

Sorry, please ask your question.

Are you interested in looking to purchase some businesses?

We are interested in looking to purchase some businesses.

Yes.

So, what were the first steps?

Well, we're going to think about looking.

Yes.

We think about looking.

We're interested in that.

Have you thought passed that or something?

No, not yet.

We're the beginning.

Yeah.

We're interested in looking to get all those places.

Get all your ducks and all your money.

That's right.

I have a great business I would love for you to consider thinking about investing in.

It is a platform for people to interact with one and another.

Ooh.

Like on the internet, a social media platform do you mean?

You've never seen nothing like it before.

It is, you can put photographs, captions as well.

Put photographs where?

It sounds like Instagram.

Or a scrapbook.

Does Instagram include captions?

I've heard that a few times.

Oh, it does.

It sounds like it.

But these are old photos.

So old, they're not eligible for Instagram's throwback Thursday.

Oh.

I forget what the cutoff point is.

What is the cutoff year for throwback Thursday?

If your photo is older than 40 years, you can't put a different throwback there.

I forgot.

That's in the terms of service.

I forgot.

I can't get my maybe picture to stay.

I've never seen a TBT from Civil Rights era, huh?

Yes.

Whatever he just said.

Sure.

Are you interested in looking to invest in?

Are you interested in thinking about looking?

Yes, exactly.

I can't tell.

Is it on the internet?

Is it a social media platform or is it a literal platform?

You go on.

I don't know the answer to your question.

Scott David are coming.

But you go on to the web.

Are we talking about spider web or are we talking about the...

The actual world.

Get on a spider web.

That's something...

Will it be any spider web or is it specific?

Well now you're putting words into my mouth.

You can...

Whatever the...

Please put words into your mouth that helps us make sense of this.

Words come out of my mouth.

They don't go back in.

I understand the words.

It's coming out of your mouth.

Your mouth is exit only.

Can you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?

I can't understand the words.

Cuck a lot of your mouth.

I'm saying almost nobody understands the words coming out of my mouth.

Rudy, what movie is that from?

Oh what?

What movie is that?

That's obviously a movie reference.

No.

You saw another movie without me?

Okay I saw a rush hour.

Right is that it?

Rush hour.

Rush hour two.

I have an idea for a movie as well.

I think they did it as well.

You do.

Yes.

Were you moving on from this platform?

Well y'all don't seem to understand.

Oh you were just grabbing...

No!

You were just grabbing something that already existed.

We wanted to understand.

Oh no.

You telling me that there's a platform where you could put photos that are older than 40 years old?

Multiple.

My name one.

Facebook.

He's going down.

Okay okay.

Do you know something that we know?

Oh okay.

Mark Zuckerberg is going down with the guff.

Please use his full name.

Mark Anthony Zuckerberg.

By the way what is the...

What is the key...

What does the P stand for in your name and why aren't you insisting I use that?

It is just P.

Oh it's just...

Oh it's P-E-E.

It's a whole range of J's that you like that famous tape.

P-E-E capital E. The last one is a capital E.

My favorite movie.

It's bookended by some capitals.

The P tape.

P-E-E-E.

I love that film.

So you're pitching.

So you're saying Facebook's going down.

So you're pitching a replacement to that?

No it's not a replacement.

What I do is original.

Say that again?

Original.

So people will not do the same things they did on Facebook.

They will do totally separate things.

Yes.

This will not be a substitute for Facebook.

Yes.

So they will talk to their parents.

People will accept friend requests from their grandparent.

Can I ask you a question?

Entre P. Newer.

Yes.

Have you ever been on Facebook?

I've seen it from a distance.

How far of a distance is like a football field?

I had a coffee shop over a young man who I spoke to him.

He said he was a writer.

Okay.

But he spent the whole time on Facebook.

Oh that's pretty common here in Los Angeles.

One of the features of your website is I can accept a friend request from my grandparent.

Precisely.

And you put that in a bitch.

Precisely.

And you can also...

That's the second thing in your pitch.

If you're not...

If you're front loading your pitch with this.

If you're not looking to invest in my product I have other products.

Yeah tell us your idea for the movie.

A black and an Asian man.

A black period.

An Asian man.

Two times.

So first sentence a black.

A black period.

It's subject, predicate, verb, all of it.

Okay.

Yep.

And an Asian man.

They're police.

Okay.

And they're going to...

And just...

Can I ask...

Can I ask someone not understand words that are coming out of someone's mouth?

Sure.

Is it a sequel?

No it's called Hushour.

Okay.

Because the other person...

Now hold on.

Have you seen a quiet place?

I've seen a quiet place.

I don't know what that is.

But a quiet place is a movie about a family.

And they are in...

I feel like I'm in church.

I feel like...

Thank you for that.

Yeah.

Pitch.

Pitch on sister.

Yeah.

Pitch on.

Let the spirit of the picture get inside tonight.

Okay.

Yeah.

The pitch coming inside people.

Yes.

Yes Lord.

Use me God.

Okay.

The pitch for a quiet place.

There's a family.

A family in a sound studio.

One the father has tried to record a mixer tape.

A mixer tape?

He wants to record his mixer.

This actually genuinely sounds like a cool original one.

Thank you.

Wait.

Why am I talking like this now?

Seeing rubs off on your note it.

Sorry.

It's pretty cochlear.

My time is off.

Your time is off the essence.

Of the ebony.

That's my magazine.

That's my magazine of choice.

Can we bake a quick bit of a question a bit?

Yeah.

Russia.

Sure.

Cush owl.

Can the Chinese guy touch the bleak guys radio or no?

Wait.

She the Chinese man don't have no hands in this one.

Oh.

He's so in fact he can't.

Why is he Chinese?

Why did you assume he's Chinese?

I'm from New Zealand.

So only Asian folks we have there.

Okay.

She just said Asian.

I did just say Asian but I appreciate your help Australian.

Yeah.

Okay.

Wait big difference.

But that's exactly what you just did with Chinese and Asian.

Oh.

I was trying to make a point.

Do you see?

Oh, very good.

Entre P. Newer.

Thank you very much.

Point was saved.

Well, if you, does anyone have.

Point just like a DURX beard here.

Point received.

The end of my beard.

What did you just put in your coat?

My beard.

Yeah.

As you can see DURX rainbow colored beard comes to a point at the end of it.

Oh, I see.

As you can see.

Does anyone have any interest in considering these businesses for funding?

Let's move on to a different business because I'm not sure about the other.

I have interest in considering that.

We're looking to be interested in considering.

We are looking.

Looking.

Oh, stop drinking.

I have a chicken.

I might be interested in a more original idea.

So these ideas have fun but they're a little fine.

They're a little, yeah.

I didn't want to do this on this podcast.

But all right.

I didn't want to out this idea because I don't have the patent just yet.

It is pending.

That's pending.

Okay.

Well, that's good though that it's pending because no one can swoop in there.

I've never heard of something patent pending that someone was like got in there, you know, a little earlier.

Right.

Well, this one is, oh, this is, this is going to be my claim to fame.

Okay.

Wait.

Great.

A, a rectangular shaped object with four to five seats inside of it.

Oh.

Well, in front of one seat.

You're, you're, you're, you're describing a car right now.

Hold on.

Describe it a car.

Wait, what does it do?

What does it do?

What is it?

What is this about?

It, the person, somebody will sit in the car.

Oh, oh, shit.

You just said car.

You pitched a car.

You know what a car is.

You're just copying ideas.

No, the devil doesn't got inside.

You said car, you said car and you planted a seed of doubt in my mind.

I beg your pardon.

I'm sorry.

I don't need to get in your head.

Number two.

Oh, yes.

Good shit.

Good shit to my boy.

Was this all so I wasn't listening to the clip.

I was looking at stuff.

Yeah.

Was Madeline Walter, by the way, came after these clips and did Charlie Mansett.

That's right.

Was this the debut of Speed Force Thanksgiving?

Yes.

That's a concept that has delighted me.

I enjoyed that as well.

Yeah, there's a separate thing.

That takes place inside the Speed Force.

And apparently in one of the clips that we didn't play from this, I learned all of Rudy's backstory in the Speed Force.

Like in all the time that we spent together.

That's right.

So I have to remember that next time we do an episode that I apparently know all of us.

They're not crying.

And we found out in our last episode in the holiday spectacular right before these episodes that apparently Rudy is Jewish.

So that's good to know.

Oh, Judy North.

Yeah, Judy North.

You don't think...

Is he the wandering Jew?

What?

Rooting or is he the wandering Jew?

Well, did you say that he's been alive since Christ died since 33?

I believe so, yeah.

Did I say that?

I think he said...

About the wandering Jew?

Yeah.

The wandering Jew was there for the crucifixion.

Not much we know.

Right.

And he's been wandering ever since then.

Yeah.

Oh, we got to ask him this.

Do you think for the wandering Jew, like did he know he was cursed at the time?

Like did Jesus...

Or did he just like a year when buying his like no wrinkles yet?

Awesome.

No wrinkles yet?

We don't know that he was in age.

That's true.

Yeah, he might be 2000 years old.

Yeah, he might look like shit.

I said no wonder he's wandered around.

Yeah.

I don't know.

We got to find this guy.

We got to find this.

We're in the world is the wandering Jew.

I feel uncomfortable saying Jew so much.

Jew.

But it is...

The lurk.

That's the one.

That's what he calls himself.

He's a man person.

It's me, the wanderer Jew.

All right.

Let's go to a break.

When we come back, we're going to get to it your number one episode of the year.

Very, very exciting.

Just to reiterate if I'm not in this episode, I will be furious.

Yikes.

All right.

Real cliffhanger.

We'll see you on the other side of this.

Comedy bang bang.

And we ended the previous segment on a cliffhanger.

That's right.

Paul F.

Previously on Desom Comedy Bang Bang.

Now just to reiterate, if I am not on this episode, I will be furious.

All right.

And why will you be furious?

I'm glad you asked me that, Scott.

What is it about...

I know as human beings, we all want to be recognized for what we do.

We want to feel that our time on this earth was not for not.

That's right.

Is that a hit?

Did I just explain it?

Oh, that's a big part of it.

Then explain the rest.

I will explain the rest and thank you for giving me this platform.

I do and I do and I do for these people.

And if they want to toss me aside now, after all that I've done...

All you've done?

I intend you to do?

No, Paul.

I will not be able to contain...

Paul, they love what you do.

They love what you do.

Maybe they don't love it enough to vote it into the number one spot?

Do you know how they prove that they love it?

How?

By voting it into the number one spot.

All right.

You're in my mind, Kratzken.

Well, look, I think it's time we get to it.

It's time we get to your number one.

Number one.

Which I will remind you from them.

If you're not, you're going to be furious.

Okay.

Do you remember the other episodes you did this year?

I don't remember anything.

So then why do you think this?

We may have gone through all of the episodes that you've done this year.

We may have already breezed through them all and they were...

Breezed through them all.

What episodes do you remember that you did this year?

I remember when I played Breezed through them all.

Breezed through them all.

Now you have to do a character called Breezed through them all.

That sounds like at least a war episode.

Right.

Or was it JW Silver?

Yes.

Born that way.

Well, that's how Big Chunky Bubbles was.

Y'all safe?

I started doing that voice on a best of.

Oh, right.

And then in January we did that show that show.

Oh, yes.

Oh, yeah.

It was all safe.

That's right.

Right.

I heard a crown go.

That's what it's done with me.

That's right.

Yeah.

Good shit.

We should do more of that stuff.

We should do more stuff.

I don't know.

Just fucking around until we find a character.

How about this guy?

Hi.

I don't hate him.

He's not bad.

I mean, I took a real risk there.

Anywhere my point is, I'm the best.

You are the best.

It needs to be recognized all the time.

Well, what do you think then?

Do you think that this episode is going to have you in it?

If you had to guess what is the top episode of here?

I'm not in the business of guessing.

I'm just going to say, if I'm not in this episode, I will be furious.

All right.

Well, let me tell you that this is episode number 525.

Aha.

Okay.

I can't give you any sort of hints.

Now you may remember earlier on in our countdown, episode 524 was on it.

Merry chunky Christmas.

It's not looking good, Scott.

Not looking good.

So 525, the very next week, what do you think it could be?

The very next week.

What song is that?

I joined in with the cat.

The cat came back.

The cat came back the very next day.

The cat came.

Did you sing that at camp?

Somehow I sang that at camp.

That was like a big campfire thing.

The cat came back the very next day.

The cat came back.

We thought it was a goner, but the cat came back.

He just couldn't stay away.

Real chazzy.

There goes the spider man.

Spider man.

Let's do this.

You sing Spider man and I'll sing cat came back.

5, 6, 7, 8.

The cat came back the bionic state.

We thought it was a goner.

The cat came back.

You just couldn't stay.

The cat came back the cat came back the cat came back.

He just couldn't stay away.

I think Sam got a video of that.

Good stuff.

Oh, see?

See?

Why wouldn't I be in the number one episode?

I tell you Paul, people said.

Plus I do these.

People have said this every year.

They said if we could vote on the best of episodes, they would be the most popular episodes of the year.

People love these.

Unfortunately, they are ineligible.

But look, this is episode 525.

This is the episode after- Oh, I know that what looked like.

After Mary Chunky Christmas.

What episode could it possibly be?

I don't know.

Happy Chunky New Year?

No.

How the fuck do I know?

It is, of course, the 2017 holiday spectacular.

Wait a minute.

That's right.

And let me tell you who's in this episode.

We have Jason Manzukas, John Gabrizz, Lauren Lapkis, Mike Hanford, James Edomian, Karl Tartch, Toni Newsom, Jeremy Rowley, Drew Tarver, Neil Campbell, the band Mr. Heavenly, and Paul of Tomp.

Oh, yeah.

You're out of order.

You're all out of the devil's advocate.

Oh, our boss sent them a woman.

Powerball.

Mebedeeza Scrooge.

If Alpatina were to do a Christmas carol, as have an user's screw, would he play him as a powerball?

You'd have to.

First of all, if you respect the text, you'd have to.

You'd have to.

Can you imagine anyone worse playing him and he's a Scrooge?

I mean, he would just shout.

Spirit!

Rama Mustard!

Get out of here.

I think as big as me, sir.

I think Justin Beef.

What day is it?

I'm awful.

Who has he played recently?

Paterno?

That's right.

Who else?

Raterno.

Raterno, of course.

Uh, famous sequel.

I think that's a sequel that's better than the original.

I think Raterno is so much better than Paterno.

You play Paterno, you play Kevorkian.

You play Bill Spector.

What is it with this guy?

He's going to play like famous weirdos for the rest of his life.

You've got to play the jinx.

The jinx.

You've got to play the jinx.

That jinx.

But she know he's got to play the jinx.

You're just couldn't stay away.

Just couldn't stay away.

Hey!

Blah, blah, blah.

Um, this was a really fun episode to do.

Um, as I talked about, um, Mr. Heavenly.

Yeah.

Um, great band, uh, that, uh, engineer Brett plays in.

That's right.

He plays, uh, guitar or bass.

I can't recall for that band.

Well, the bass is, uh, bass is always guitar, but guitar is always bass.

No, no, no, we don't know.

Um, they are playing and occasionally they will chime in, uh, and grind the episode to a halt.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

No, they're great.

Um, before the clip we're going to hear, uh, the, before the first clip we're going to hear, because we're going to hear several clips.

Um, we can't play the whole thing.

It's a two hour, two and a half hour show.

Uh, first we talked to Jason Manzukas.

Um, Lauren Lapkis playing Ho-Ho the naughty elf is there.

Uh, John Gabris is playing intern Gino.

He talks to us for a while.

Oh, he does play Gino on this one?

Yes, he does.

And Mike Hanford plays John Lennon, who, uh, as we all know, if you have been listening to the show, uh, is the famous John Lennon, who after being dead for five years, decided to come back to life and is now alive in New York City.

Um, so we, uh, we, before this clip, we have, uh, been talking to them.

So they're all in the room when we introduce Paul here, who is playing mayor, Junius, Bobboudunary, who is the tiny mayor who lives in the walls.

And we find out something very surprising about you in the first clip.

That's right.

Something that I didn't remember about your, uh, backstory and, uh, about my backstory about, well, just about your, uh, mayor, Junius, Bobboudunary, just your identity.

A fun fact about it.

Yes.

So we'll hear that.

Uh, the next clip that we're going to hear is, uh, Carl Tarte as MC Sugarbutt, who is a rapper who went into a coma in the, in around 1985 and then woke up recently.

So everything he says is in the style of rap from the early 80s.

That's right.

And also James Adomian as Chris Matthews.

And this is such a good impression that James does.

Yes, it was like killing us while he was doing it.

Um, so those are the clips we're going to hear.

Let's hear them.

This is your episode number one.

Number one.

Uh, he is the mayor of, where are you a mayor of again?

I'm the mayor of inside the wall.

That old lady's here.

Look, it is that old lady.

I'm not an old lady.

My voice isn't quaverry at all.

Okay.

I know.

I'm just little.

Right.

Please welcome back to the show mayor, Junius, Bobboudunary.

Hello mayor.

Hello.

My size.

Oh, who is this creature?

This is hello, the Nadio.

So just for, just for the listener at home, can you guys describe the size disparity between the two of you?

I'm the size of a dollar bill.

And I'm slightly smaller than that.

Wonderful.

Thank you.

A foreign dollar.

Like a euro?

A good.

He's got a coin.

Sorry.

He got you there.

He's saying he.

Sing.

I know he's a perch.

Geez, I don't know.

Uh, you, you, oh, you seem, you seem very intrigued when you saw someone that's just a little bit smaller than you.

Just nicer.

Oh, boy.

Well, you know, there are certain similarities between this race of creature and my own.

Mr. Mayor, just as a heads up, you stand in ankle deep in what I think is ho-ho comes.

So this is a heads up.

It's snow.

Yeah, but I, it did come from the tip of his peeps.

That candy cane?

I guess it's still out.

Yeah, you see what I'm talking about.

You know, it sounds like he's fine with it.

It's a buzzing to bother him.

It's snow at a candy cane.

I mean, what, what's the big deal?

This is great.

But you put it that way.

You should get tested.

Where are you from?

I'm from inside the wall.

Oh.

Why is that so horrible to you?

It's creepy.

Well, you're from this weird old house up in the North Pole.

That's creepy to some.

People love the North Pole.

They talk about it for their whole life.

Their whole life.

Yeah.

I mean, at best, maybe like a week at the end of the year.

You're talking about it now.

Well, it's a week at the end of the year.

He's got those.

Do people live inside the walls along with you or just you?

Yes, though.

I'm part of a race of people that live inside the walls.

Which is the mayor?

I'm the mayor of them.

And how many people do you govern?

Oh, untold millions.

Untold millions.

Yes.

So this is all walls all over the world.

All walls all over the world.

There's a lot of space.

No gerrymandering with all these walls.

How dare you?

Well, and can I ask you as a mayor, do you oversee a small number of those millions?

Or is mayor the highest level of political office in the wall people?

How high does this go up?

As far as the presidency?

Follow the money, Scott.

Follow the money.

Which, as I have established before, is cookies.

Our currency is cookies.

Right, by the way.

Do you mean cocaine?

Because these guys over here say if you say cookies, you can do cocaine.

That's true.

Cookies is slag for cocaine where I come from.

But it also means money, but it also means actual cookies.

Okay.

Actually, here are some holiday cookies, by the way.

Here are some holiday cookies.

Oh, thank you.

Oh, I'm rich.

They're in a plastic bag.

It's supposed to be careful.

Have we just done rest?

Do you eat the money or do you just spend it?

Do you think cookies are good in your land?

Or is that not edible because it's money?

It gets confusing because we're spending cookies to buy cookies to eat.

Right.

So are they're eating cookies and spending cookies?

It's all the same, but you have to be specific.

How many are you exchanging them?

How many cookies can you?

I'm giving you this.

How many cookies does one cookie buy you?

It's a what to want.

Are there any other food besides cookies?

It's not a trading system.

Well, there is other food, but food that we get from humans when they're asleep.

Okay, but that's okay.

So you're not...

You're not...

It's solely subsiding on cookies.

No, I mean...

You should just eat cookies.

I mean, you should eat other stuff.

Right, yeah.

Yeah.

So are there good cookies and bad cookies?

Like, are there some cookies that people go, oh god, not butter cookies?

Yeah, it's fucking cookies.

What do you mean?

Right, of course there are good bad cookies.

Would you trade a bad cookie and get a good cookie?

I don't think we're not discerning at all.

Just any cookie is great.

Everything about you is different.

So I want to know what these different things are.

Mr. Mayor, I do just want to say that Scott speaks only for himself.

Thank you very much.

And that I consider you and your population to have probably even the most discerning taste.

All right, so what would you consider being a discerning little person to be a poor tasting cookie?

Um, bit cells, any of those Italian cookies that all taste like licorice.

Right, okay.

So but don't like them.

If you get one of those...

We got a different minute...

...opposed.

That's the trick though.

If you...

It's starting to work.

I just want to eat a cookie.

Fair enough.

No, that's just...

Fair enough.

Jesus, just learn that on a...

...parillo towards the end of the...

I was on a parillo towards...

What's that?

It's almost like parillo.

Hey, hello!

So if you acquire one of these cookies, one of these poor tasting cookies...

Yeah, if I bought a cookie...

Are you allowed to spend it and buy a good tasting cookie?

Yes, there's some weirdo who wants that cookie, but here's the thing.

If I am unfortunate enough to have bought a poor tasting cookie, well that's an eating cookie and I'm just stuck with it.

Because that was the arrangement that was decided upon.

And how long does it take you to eat one poor tasting cookie?

It's not fast.

Right.

You can't just switch that into a spending cookie.

What?

The whole system would break down.

Oh my God, he's giving you a rest in the face.

I have a question.

If you've got a cookie in your bag, you know, like a...

In my cookie bag.

A good spending cookie.

Which by the way is as big as you.

That's right.

So now let's say you take a nasty tumble and you open up your bag and you're cooking...

You have it for bid!

...is in crumbles.

It's all crumbs now.

Because sometimes cookies are crumbles.

Money's all in crumbles.

Money's writing a song!

Oh my God!

Get out of the guitar!

Yes, sir, heavenly.

Give it a guitar!

Send me that bass.

I want to try that thing out.

I can't touch my finger.

Oh wait a minute.

He's putting it on and...

Oh, Nick just...

Oh!

Put it at the Paul Godly School of Bass.

The Paul Godly Bruster.

Does that crumbled cookie retain its value as crumbs or no?

It's changed now.

It is.

It's like pocket change?

Yeah.

And it's one of our human dollars of its shadows.

It just has to change.

I'm sorry?

I'm sorry.

Continue with your story.

Is each crumb equal?

So like if it breaks into five crumbs.

I'd like to pursue what John was talking about.

You know when you have a dollar bill?

Sure.

And you drop it on the cold.

The Frobrick is a holiday special.

And you drop it on the ground and it shatters and it's changed.

Maybe that's never happened to anyone here.

I guess I've never tried it.

A frozen dollar bill?

Yeah.

Just shatters into time.

Just shatters into times.

And you'd shake those and they shatters into pennies.

What's the temperature at which paper freezes?

I think.

And I'm...

Look at what I'm...

Mayor, can you tell us about your outfit because it's so weird.

I don't see how it's so weird.

I'm merely wearing my cutaway coat with mayoral sash by Striped Trousers and my top hat.

Right.

No shirt.

Not taken.

No shoes.

No service.

You stand in barefoot in what is definitely Elfcomb, my friend.

Seriously.

He doesn't have a problem with it.

He doesn't have a problem.

It feels like snow.

I don't know what to tell you.

You are...

Your feet are blistering actively.

It's too much to eat.

Do you like blistery feet?

Yeah.

I like getting nasty.

Yeah.

I believe you had a question about the crubs.

Well sure.

Are they equally divisible?

Are they worth one crumb apiece?

No.

The crubs, you have to count the crubs from a crumbled cookie to determine what the worth of each crub is.

That's right.

You gotta warm up.

Count the crumbs from a crumbled cookie determined what the worth is.

Why are you warming up your voice?

Because I'm going up stage.

What do you like?

What's the play?

Really?

What's the play?

My life in pieces.

Where?

Is it about a dollar bill?

Yeah.

Well, I mean, it's always fascinating to have two people of the same size here in the...

Is it?

That's fascinating.

How often does it happen?

Well, I mean usually I'm lining up every guest back to back just to see.

And usually people are like, one's five ten, one's five eleven.

But you know, you're...

But we're not the same.

He's smaller than he.

I'm smaller than he.

What?

I'm slightly...

But no, but the most exciting...

Just because one size is all the same.

No, see that's not true.

Stop lining us up back to back.

Scott is like Wrigley and Burj- You want to be front to front?

What is up front to front?

Front to front.

Front to front butt.

No, front to back.

I'm just happy that in the event of...

Front to the back.

In the event of a fire drill, I'm the first out the door.

Why is that?

I'm the smallest.

Okay.

Mr. Tallis.

Yeah, but it's going to take you such a long time you have such a short stride.

I would think that...

Very spry!

I'll be honest.

How fast can you run?

Watch this.

Oh my gosh.

I love it.

I didn't even have time to get a stopwatch out.

Wow, that is incredible.

Okay, I'll come back.

Boom.

See?

Oh my God.

That was like 70, 80 miles an hour.

Something like that.

That's above what Sammy Hager would do.

What do you mean?

Because he can't try...

He tops out at 60 or so.

Oh, I thought it was that...

I thought I can't drive 55 beats.

He never got up to 55.

I thought he was always at 54 or 56.

He just couldn't get it right.

He cruised control style.

He just wants to get it at 55.

Hey, I think the original draft was like, I can't drive 55!

I heard it turns out he had a marble under the accelerator.

So it wouldn't go all the way down.

Really?

Yeah.

Who put it there, a little person?

He made me.

So what are your traditions during the holidays?

Well, during the holidays, of course, we like to move out of the walls.

And then we can turn into gingerbread houses.

Oh, really?

Is that why we make them?

I guess I never realized why.

Yes, it's an ancient path between humans and our people.

Really?

Yeah, I've always done it for fun.

What?

Maybe that's what you thought.

Sure, yeah.

I guess I never realized the reasons why.

You know, when you're making a gingerbread house...

Sure.

And your mind goes blank.

And you're just like a robot that's been taken over by another consciousness.

Oh gosh, I guess.

And then when you're done, there's a gingerbread house there.

Sure.

Cully known as the gingerbread fugue state.

That's right.

That's because of us!

You're welcome.

Ed, we thank you.

And why do you like to do this?

I mean, it seems like if you had to be displaced, it would be unpleasant.

Well, it's not that we're not going that far.

It's just from the walls to the gingerbread house.

Sure, but I mean, in accordance to your size, that's like, you know, me moving two blocks away.

It would still be an inconvenience.

Okay.

You're getting really hung up on scale.

Yeah.

I know you can move fast.

Is gingerbread considered a cookie?

It's like living in a mansion.

It's like living in a house made of a dollar bill.

You gotta go toilet.

Or do you have a gingerbread toilet?

We have a cupcake toilet.

Wait, are cupcakes currancy as well?

No, no, hold it a cupcake.

No, they're just very comfortable.

But you sit on a soft toilet?

Yeah, why not?

Because then the pot just goes in your butt.

What?

What did you say?

There's a poop just ho-ho goes in your butt.

There's a hole.

There is a hole.

Okay.

We have not a hole.

The seat is a cupcake.

Got it.

I've never been there.

Can I ask you a question?

How kind of you?

Maybe you'd see a different way of life that you could enjoy.

Mmm, what's wrong with my life?

Well, institutes and motels all night long, baby.

Laying on a cockroach.

You said baby too?

Rolling across the ground.

Yeah.

A few of us do, I think.

What was your question, Jason?

Oh, baby.

When you live inside the walls, are you living in houses, in the walls?

Or no?

Is that why you?

No, it's not houses.

It's like little platforms and stuff.

It's not very convenient.

Why not have us make permanent housing for you?

Jason, can I stop you right there?

We do.

The last time I was here.

This was covered.

This was my, well, this is my party words to everyone.

Please, humans, consider putting working, plumbing in dollhouses.

It would make things so much easier for everybody.

I mean.

Just a dollhouse, keep it all the same, but put a working shower, sink, toilet, and then.

Oh yeah, I've been fooled a few times by those.

What are you doing going on?

What do you mean dollhouses?

You know, I'm just an emergency, you know, I'm my stepdad's in the can and I gotta, I look around and all that's left.

You know, you've been at a home depot and, you know, you're just like, oh, thank God, I got a shit so bad.

Then you realize you're on a display toilet in the middle of an aisle?

No, me neither.

You ever walk down that door aisle and you keep opening the doors?

Because you think there's a hundred rooms?

Screaming, how do I get out of here?

How do I get out of here?

I use the home depot door section as my mind palace to help me remember things.

You sure are locked dial?

You ever know where your friends have to eat and the food just ain't no good?

What, what do you mean, like the macaroni soggy?

The peas are mushy.

What's the chicken taste like?

What?

This is ringing a bell to me for some reason.

I can't recall why.

It's the season.

Oh, that's right.

Ring some jingle bell.

How do you feel, sir, if I may ask about the borrowers?

Now let me say, oh boy, oh man, we talked about this.

We did okay.

I figured it might have come up.

I know it.

It's a sore spot.

Here's the one.

The borrower is great.

It's okay.

I get this a lot.

Here's what I don't like.

The borrower.

The littles.

The steward will hate him.

Really?

Is that a mouse?

Yes.

It's gross.

He's vermin.

Wait, but there's, there must be plenty of bugs in vermin where you guys live, right?

Yeah.

Do we don't like them?

Do you?

It's the same size as you.

It's like you seeing a bear, Scott.

I love bears.

What about the Indian and the other?

We're not talking about our search terms again.

Not fair.

John Lennon hung his candy cane on his microphone.

I was going to eat it later.

So you put it on your microphone to remind you?

I started eating it.

Oh.

And then I, you know, I can't eat the whole thing.

And you don't want to put it upon the table because it's a term that's masted to it.

Oh, this ink everywhere.

Right, of course.

Yeah.

I wanted to ask a question of the mayor.

To the mayor.

Please.

Feel free to ask it to and of me.

What is the name of your people again?

Did we ever find that out?

Um, no, you know, I hadn't, I hadn't mentioned that.

I don't think it's important.

Wait, the name, what was it?

The name of your people?

Yeah, I think that's important.

Nobody needs to know that.

No, no, wait.

Humans.

Are you human?

Yeah.

I'm just a small human.

Soly dear.

Did you say soul eater?

Yes.

Wait, it's soul eater.

We're called soul eaters.

Are you soul eaters?

Yes.

Do you eat?

Think that's a staple.

I'm a duck.

Do you remember how I said we eat cookies?

We love cookies.

Oh, the soul eaters.

Sorry.

You also said you don't eat those exclusively.

Are you eating human being souls?

We're not, okay.

Look, we're not eating like all of the soul.

It's just enough.

We're little, we're little.

It's just enough to get by.

Kill him.

Wait, wait, wait.

Get him.

Hold on.

Get him.

I'm gonna get him.

Hold him down.

I'm over here.

Let him grab you.

He's too fast.

If I gotta get out of here, I do this candy cane with me.

He's been on the show before and it's wonderful to have him back.

Let's first welcome MC Sugarbud.

How are you?

Get on up there and get on down.

Sugar but is in your Christmas time.

Oh, very good MC Sugarbud.

It's snowing.

Snowing.

Scotty Z.

How you beat?

I'm good.

It's actually not snow.

It's ho-ho come.

Hey.

Ho-ho come.

It's a broken row.

Oh, I think it's on.

I also want to welcome, I don't believe he's ever been on the show before.

But he is.

That was a bit fair.

Lawty first time.

Yeah, he's currently.

He's a bit fair.

Missed Miss Sargent.

Missed Missed Missed Missed Missed Missed Missed Missed.

MSc the host of Hardball.

Please welcome Chris Matthews.

Missed Miss Scott.

Chris Matthews.

What are your thoughts on politics?

I don't know what you're saying.

Have I ever suffered a Quinnipiac?

Yes, that's valid.

I don't think I've ever suffered from one.

No, it's.

You'd know it if you had.

Quinnipiac is a certain kind of stroke that broadcasters go ahead and tell them a day.

Oh, is that what they're talking about when they talk about the Quinnipiac?

Quinnipiac, Paul.

Yeah, Paul.

Yeah, it's so good to see you.

It's so great to be here.

You know, when you come, when you think of podcasts and you let your very tip on you on one side, we got to take a break.

Great, great.

And MSc, MSc Sugarbud, you are a musician and John Lennon here is a musician.

Oh, John Lennon.

John Lennon.

What's a part of the doors?

Oh.

That's a curious, you see, that's why I bring it up because not everyone else, but Bandai was part of, you know, part of the European rock band.

The doors were in America.

Who?

You brought him up first.

Behind you, there is another American band, Mr. Heavenly.

Mr. Heavenly, not in hell.

People in jail go to sleep.

Oh, boy.

His rhymes aren't wrong.

I have a best way to pass the time when you're in jail.

Just sleep.

MSc Sugarbud are you known for your freestyles?

You know, I'm known all across the world to all the pretty girls.

I'm all the raps that you have in Dead Sea.

I like that line because it didn't rhyme.

I know.

You have a lot of trouble sticking to Landon.

You know what though?

Keep going.

I think you're going to get there.

Is that Jason Mann over there?

Jason Mann, shout-sout.

Oh, just say it.

That's just him.

It's a Shaggy Sugarbud.

If you're down with the primary, will you rent third party?

You don't win the primary when you rent third party.

Oh, yeah.

It's real and dead.

I'm going to run for independent.

Oh, very good.

It's real and dead.

Yeah, you never heard about it.

I know you're not supposed to run the same word twice, but apparently you can just take ladders out.

That's true.

No, in-depth space in front of a paragraph.

That's real tall.

Is that a giraffe?

You're going to get- Hey, he's getting better.

Do you got double space?

I got a giraffe in here.

Do you double space your jackets?

Always.

Double space.

Makes the pages longer.

And he's back.

Ha ha ha ha.

Chris Matthews, what's going on this year?

That's safe to say, right?

This is fantastic here.

It's a wonderful year for politics.

You got Vladimir Putin doing the thing?

I mean- Vladimir Putin polling number number one.

You're primary and Chris buying polls.

That's true.

Outlayer is Zagby.

Where did we cut that Zagby?

Mayor Julius.

That's true.

Yeah, I guess not.

You registered Zagby poll.

Point four.

Yes, well, that's those polls.

Look, it's early days and I don't think this is the time to be paying attention to polls.

Certainly not the Zagby poll.

Okay, it sounds like a guy who's running for office or trying to dodge some kind of scandal.

Well, he is trying to dodge a scandal.

He's admitted to eating souls.

Of evil people.

Well, maybe he can take over to Joe Scarborough when he's done.

Hey, how's his band doing?

They think it's fun.

You know what?

I actually go sometimes.

They get a nice ale.

I drink about half it.

You ever see me on MSNBC where it's just me broadcasting in front of a town hall, people walking around voting and stuff?

That's all fake.

There's cops all over the place.

Make sure everybody gets in front of me.

Cool.

Great.

Well, great.

I'm reviewing that band.

I wish I'd have tried letting it.

John Lennon.

You were shot in shot Manhattan.

Did you ever complain to Mayor John Lindsay in New York City, crime and punishment?

I said this time.

I can't have it all guy like me.

If it happens to me, I can't have it anyone.

Are you the wars?

Look, I don't need to talk about it.

I don't think we need to answer that right here right now.

I'll talk to you about that off the air.

Okay, John, that does you a question there.

It must hurt because shot in the back.

Would you pretty shot in the front?

Would that have been better?

I think I would have liked to have seated coming.

But there would be a danger of you getting shot in the nuts though.

That's true.

That is very true.

You're just shot in the nuts from behind.

Yeah, that's true.

I guess if they're sleeping.

If you got a nice, pretty white.

I was at the time when I got shot.

Thank God I was a shot in the nuts.

I was walking around the streets with my pants down.

You were?

They don't talk about that.

They tell me slow.

Do your nuts hang down real low?

Tell them really slow.

I'll tell you slow.

Let's really take our time with this.

In the winter time when I'm pantsless in New York City.

Get on deck.

They drag on the cold concrete.

Burn up burn.

In the winter.

Keep big and high on my nuts, drinking.

Bye, my friend.

That was a classic beetle stumper right there.

Was it B-side, C-side or D-side?

That was a D.

Wow, my God.

I have to go.

I'm hungry.

Oh, really?

Oh, it's always nice to see you.

Hello, bye, Merry Christmas.

Fuck you.

Strong words from Ho Ho.

Have fun.

All right, so you didn't get a chance to interrogate Ho Ho.

But did you ever get a present as a child during the winter times?

By sure.

I got a bunch of buttons to reelect ice an hour.

Ice an hour.

Ice an hour buttons.

Buttons supporting him.

Sure, I used to have a founding member of the Scoop Jackson fan club when I secured your high school.

Who else you want me to reach back to?

I, yeah, yeah.

Three more names would be great.

Just to place you in time.

Well, Teddy K was fantastic.

You said Teddy Kady Chris.

We needed him for breakfast.

Ted Kady Chris.

This is post-Chap Aquatic.

Well, yeah, you were supposed to just, you were supposed to knock the cereal all over and we all was trapped.

Some of it would drown, but some of it would swim back and testify.

You could eat your bowl of cereal, cagrids.

Oh my gosh.

I understand about every third word you're saying.

That's, you know, politics.

That's, that's politics.

That's gonna go over some people's heads.

It's about people involved.

It could be a ball.

MC Sugar, how do you spend the holidays?

I spend the holidays with my fam.

He's sitting right there.

It's Jason Mann.

Yeah.

Your fam, your family, not related by blood, are you?

Not related by blood, not related by flesh.

Hey, you looking real French.

Is that deodorant under your arms?

Yeah, it's a little bit.

I put on a little splash this morning.

Hell.

Cool water brand deodorant.

We, I mean, you know, always wearing a tank top.

I gotta have a tank top.

Sun's out, guns out.

Sky's out, thighs out.

Ooh.

Get them going.

You could try to get by, but you gotta get trapped.

How many, how many tattoos do you have, you know?

I have one tattoo on itself, the island of which I was born.

Yeah.

Look, I like, I slip fantastic airport.

Love that airport.

Really?

You spend a lot of time?

It's a cemetery where my dad's buried.

Do you go, do you only fly into and out of my slip everywhere else?

I go and sell a train, damn trek.

Wait, are you also being a human table at Palm Springs as well?

Or are you going into the Palm Springs airport?

Oh, yeah, sure.

If you need me to Palm Springs airport, but I would take the accelerator there and it doesn't run there.

So I'm able to jump it off the tracks and just run it.

It's not gonna pop up.

I got a special loud car.

I was like, I got special privileges because I have a loud car.

I was, yes, there's a quiet car in most the Amtrak chairs.

They have the loud car.

I just sit in the front and go, hey, politics!

All the windows are down.

Yeah, the windows are down.

You ever cleared cattle just from just sheer drool and volume?

I have special privileges.

Yeah, I was born in the Ocelotres somewhere in Chesapeake Bay.

You were?

How many years ago now?

How old have a man or I look at you sometimes on television and I can't tell exactly your age?

Listen, that's intentional.

You said intentional.

Like, you know, people have this vanity.

You want to look a little bit younger, so I froze myself in 60.

Ooh, you froze yourself.

Yeah, I think that was my peak, so I just always want to look like a six-year-old bad vibrant.

Right, okay.

So you're above that, but you look so...

No, unless I'm you fitting, like, Maryland.

I just think the gravity test is so a six-year-old.

Really, you're going to lynch yourself to, yeah, the fourth estate.

How do you feel about, like, the current environment we're in?

A lot of guys in media, a lot of guys in your world.

Yeah, being taken down, or any fear of that from you?

That's great.

More room for Chris.

Wait, your show was an expanded name.

The halls are in DMSMBC.

Very, very few people walking around.

A lot less contact physically for cheap people.

That's good.

More room for Chris, you know?

Wait, is more room for Chris the name of his show you're doing?

That's my weekend show.

More room for Chris.

What do you talk about?

It's my weekend-filling show, or late-night-show, they do it.

If there's like, do anybody bam off here?

Chris Matthews fills in.

More room for Chris.

Is that about politics or about local interests?

No, it's about local interests.

It's about local interests.

It's about, you know, just school issues, education, bar reviews.

You help?

Look at any help.

You just go on Yelp and read reviews?

I go on Yelp, but I don't even necessarily vocalize.

You just be clicking through Yelp.

When you walked in, I didn't think your face could get any read of, but I was way wrong.

Jesus Christ, Chris, you okay pal?

Sure, yeah, I live in a diet and radishes and strawberry juice.

It's very Christmassy.

Yeah.

It's festive.

Yeah, thank you.

They plan for the holidays, but it's a controversy.

ACLU said you shouldn't have a Christmas parade.

You're going to go ahead with it anyway, eat the flesh?

We are going to have a Christmas parade, as we always do, mimicking human behavior.

That's what we do.

Where does this parade?

It occurred because you're in gingerbread houses.

It's inside that goddamn wall.

You know, so when you're in living in gingerbread houses, you go back in the parade.

Yeah, yeah.

It's a hassle.

What happens if a human, a full-sized human catches sight of you?

Like, because I've never seen, so you're the first person of your kind that I've ever seen.

Is that so?

Yeah, absolutely.

It was quite a surprise when you saw you for the first time.

I don't think anybody.

We're out there all the time.

We never see you.

Why do you think that's so surprising?

We're not talking about him.

We're talking.

He was considerably much taller than him.

He is like the size of a dollar bill.

But not a coin.

Smaller than a dollar bill.

For a policy question, shoot.

It's besto's.

Where do you come down?

I think that asbestos is...

He's in the wall!

It's a big male.

It's in other walls.

Okay.

All right.

Asbestos is an issue that is a big male.

I think that asbestos is a big male.

It's in other walls.

Okay.

All right.

Asbestos is an issue that is considered the third rail in politics where I come from.

Oh, yeah.

The third rail, they're really useful.

If you can't win talking about it, you can't.

Mine's even on a silly espresso.

Also a very good bar.

It is sure what the station's down there.

You need station or free station or...

How many stars on Yelp?

Sars on Yelp.

Six to six.

Wow!

Six to the half.

What?

You know what the third rail gets it unfair at being a big male.

It gets it unfair at being a big male.

Go down.

Just touch it.

Lick it sometime.

It's a little shock.

It's like a battery.

MC Sugarbot, you ever lick anything you shouldn't have?

Ooh!

That's a great QUE.

Scotty D.

I'm going to answer it for now for you.

And D.

My middle name is David.

And he knows that.

We talked about it before.

Most of the time when I'm licking things that I shouldn't be licking, I'm getting ready to do a stickin'.

Some magicians be doing trickins.

There's no to the editor.

Just take out the gears grinding a little bit.

No, I need the gears.

I'm all ears.

Listen to you and all my fears.

I'm scared of snakes.

I'm scared of bats.

I'm scared of roaches.

I'm scared of rats.

You live in the walls?

Damn, that's dumb.

You're not.

Wow!

That was the longest he's ever gone.

Number one.

Oh boy.

So good.

There it is.

That's why I'm number one.

After these...

You're number one.

After those clips, then we hear Tawny as Gary Urbanski, and then Drew Tarver and Jeremy Rowley as Keith and Ming talk to us for a bit.

And then Neil Campbell comes in as Ernie Bread.

What's this thing?

Ernie Bread, to himself.

He's a guy who plays at the pond across the street with ducks and came in saying that he was a fan favorite character.

But he was really just a guy who wanted to come in.

Ernie Bread.

By the way, his name is Ernie Bread, the thing you throw at ducks.

And his catchphrase is, does a duck quack?

Wow.

Funny stuff.

I almost included that clip, but when I listen to it back, it's really funny and then kind of other stuff happens.

It doesn't have like a definitive ending, but it's a really funny episode.

So listen to the whole thing.

Or be damned.

And that is our countdown.

Like I said, over 35,000 votes.

And let's run through some stats here.

Okay?

Who's in the most episodes that ended up in our countdown?

Paul, you will be surprised to know you were in seven episodes in our countdown this year.

You only performed in nine.

And seven of those are in our top 14.

Wow.

Not bad at all.

The ones that didn't make it are where you played JW Stillwater and Shevel Knievel.

She was another one that I forgot about.

Yeah.

Another one I'd love to talk to you again.

And then we'll talk about the next episode in seven.

Jason Manzuchas is in the second most in four of the top 14 episodes.

Lauren Lapkis is in three of them.

And then appearing in two episodes are Thomas Middleditch, Ego Wodom, Carl Tarte, Drew Tarver, Toni Newsom, Sean Diston, and Mary Holland.

Those are all two episodes.

I really enjoyed this year's countdown and the clips that you all voted for because there was like a lot of variety in it.

And new people that have not been on the show and not been in previous countdowns.

I remember there were like two years that John Gabers was on the show that just his episodes weren't ending up in the top 10.

And then I think we talked about him on one of these best ofs and said, oh man, he's so great.

People should be voting for him.

So he's been voted in since then.

But it's just great to get the new talent into the show.

I think I talked about this last best ofs.

I said that this year, 2018 was going to be a transitional year for Comedy Bang Bang.

I don't know if you remember this at all.

I do remember it.

And basically I was trying to transition you out of the top 10.

That's what I even remember.

And some did not work.

Couldn't do it.

No, and let me explain that for a bit because I think people started to think, oh, I'm ending the show.

What's going on?

And basically, I don't know if you recall Paul, but when we were taking these last years right before the holidays.

And I was kind of freaking out a little bit in terms of my schedule.

We went out to lunch in the middle of them.

And I talked to you a little bit about it.

I had a big work project that was coming up that was fairly overwhelming to me and was about to start.

And I was looking at the schedule and I was like, I don't know if I can do it.

Looking at the schedule for this show and saying, I don't know if I can do it.

And build a ship and a bottle.

Exactly.

I mean, those are my three passions.

Whatever this project is.

Doing the show.

Oh, I thought the ship and the bottle was the project.

No, no.

You had a whole other thing.

Oh, Scott, I'm so sorry.

No, I'll never stop building those ships and bottles.

I'm so sorry.

I was giving you such a hard time.

I was like, no, I did those.

No, no, I did all the.

Yeah, I built 27 this year.

Congratulations.

Thank you so much.

So anyway, so I was talking to you about it at the lunch and I was kind of like, I don't know what to do.

I was asking you if you wanted to maybe guest host some stuff.

I was just really looking at the schedule and I was freaking out about it.

And so I had some plans of what to do this year of how to achieve doing it.

Or maybe I was thinking of even going on hiatus.

I didn't know.

So anyway, to just make a long story short, the thing I was doing got postponed a couple of months.

And I worked it out.

You were like, great news.

My thing got sponed.

Business as per year.

Well, not the good thing about it was it got postponed to the extent that we had already been recording Freedom, which is our other show that we do here on the Earwolf Network.

We had recorded maybe seven or eight out of the ten that we were going to do by the time that this had come up.

And so with the postponement, I was able to finish those out, but also do 16 more of those with you guys, which was great.

So we did 26 episodes of those and those are currently airing for free on your Wolf on Thursdays.

But then I was able to do, I had already recorded maybe eight REM episodes up to then.

And I was able, I think we did like 30 of those or something.

No, maybe it wasn't that much.

But we did, yeah, I think we did, it might have done 30 of those or something.

So I was able to work out my schedule.

Everything's fine.

It almost sounds like you didn't know what the fuck you were talking about.

Well, at the time I did know what I was talking about.

But now it's like I get 30 episodes of this.

Are you having podcasts?

No, but really the thing about the show is that every year in a sense is a transitional year for the show because I want to keep having new people on.

And sometimes people are like, who is this?

Anytime there's a new person or they go, oh, they don't get it or whatever.

But that's very important to me is, if it was just the same people that we started with nine years ago, how insane would that be?

If it was, I mean, obviously Paul, you've been here the entire time almost 10 years at this point.

And there are certain people, but everyone just gets busier.

You know what I mean?

Paul, you only did nine episodes this year.

Yeah, that's true.

It is true.

At a certain point you were doing at least one a month at some point.

Yeah.

You know, just everyone gets really busy.

But that's a really important part of the show to me is to find new people to be on it.

And I love hearing the new people being so high up in the countdown.

Having Carl and Eggo's episode at number three is just fantastic.

That's terrific.

And so, you know, I think 2019 is going to be a transitional year for the show.

And we're just going to keep trying new stuff.

It's going to be our 10th anniversary.

And that's exciting.

That's a big deal.

It's a big deal.

Ten trips around this great big ball of fire that we call the sun.

What?

No, you're right.

We do call it that.

Why?

What do you call it?

I sold.

You worship it, right?

Yeah.

Okay.

You know that.

You're a soul worshipper.

Yeah.

Oh, by the way, soul eater is the thing that we found out about Mayor Junie's soul.

He eats soul.

Yeah.

I'd forgotten that aspect of it.

In any case, rather.

In any event.

No, whatever you need to say.

I have no intentions of stopping the show.

I think Rudy North last week said something like, don't stop the show or something, you know, because Sean is like listens to it and is like a fan of it.

I'm not stopping the show.

I think he was fanning the flames about this transitional year thing.

But I have no intentions of stopping it.

I still got plenty of gas in the tank.

I was just a little worried last year about just merely, you know, being able to get the show out there and I didn't want the show to suffer.

And frankly, I don't think the show suffered at all this year.

And I think it was one of our best years.

I mean, there's a stretch of episodes where it's just on fire, I think, this year.

I will say, you know that I'm a listener and I listen to the show when I'm not on it.

Yeah.

You know, I'm a first time listener.

I decided to try an episode where I wasn't on it.

I was like, this is not bad.

I listen to the show on a regular basis.

And this was a tremendous year for the show.

I, you know, this show for me is, you know, I'm running around from one thing to another.

Sure.

Constantly.

You're always doing errands.

You're always late.

I'm always doing errands.

I'm always like, I dropped my dry cleaning off.

I'm sorry.

So the guy by the counter was like, I didn't know you were going to be here.

What do I care?

It makes it worse.

So so I listened to the show a lot in the car and it keeps me company and it's, you know, keeps me, it keeps you from getting, you know, too stressed out, afraid.

Well, I mean, honestly, yeah, but, but it's, it's a, it's a companion to me.

And this has been a great year for the show.

Opanions.

I've like, they come to me at night.

In the car when I have my dry cleaning.

There's a new one, by the way.

There's a new car.

Oh, there is.

I got to talk about it on three.

Where it's like he sees a, it's a different guy.

He sees a squire.

I think it's wise that it's a different guy.

Now, what's he looking at now?

Who's this crazy old bird up to today?

He like looks down and he sees a, there's two dogs and then one disappears.

Oh, no.

It's only one.

It's just as disturbing as you.

It's not like he saw one dog and it disappeared.

No, he saw two.

There are two dogs.

Only one.

Well, so I don't even know what that one is real.

One is real because that one could go at any time.

It's not quite as dramatic as the previous car.

Okay.

Let's pull it back, guys.

How about the guy sees two dogs and then one disappears?

They're doing network notes.

Well, guys, you're really straining credulity here.

What?

He sees two dogs and one disappears.

It's easy.

This is all to say that this has been a great year for the show and I say that as a listener of the show.

Thank you very much, Paul.

And I say this as the host of the show.

I'm doing a great job.

Keep out it, Scotty boy.

These are my motivations.

No, I had a lot of fun this year.

It started to look like it was going to get hard to juggle, but it all worked out and I was able to cover my shift.

That's what it really was what it is.

That's right.

You know?

So this year is going to be even better.

It's going to be our 10th anniversary and you will not believe what we have in store.

Give him a little hint.

Uh oh.

I don't know.

But it's going to be fun.

It's going to be fun.

And keep listening to it.

It really means the world to us when you write to us on our various social media platforms to say that we get a lot of messages from people who are anything from being in the hospital and having this is the only art form that they're able to either concentrate on or consume for various reasons.

To people going through hard times who don't think that they are allowed to laugh.

And this sort of leads them into the ah of Dabda.

But it really means a lot to us to hear stuff like that.

And so we're not going to stop.

You know?

I'm not going to stop.

And I hope you don't stop listening to it until the apocalypse.

And then, and only then, are you allowed to stop listening?

But two more episodes.

Two more episodes after that.

Apocalypse two more episodes.

Two more episodes because they'll already be scheduled.

The only be scheduled.

So while you're running away from zombies or the, you know, the nuclear wasteland, uh, scarred, toxic adventure, make sure to have those headphones in the tremors worms.

Do you think that's how the apocalypse is going to come out?

I think it's going to be just like tremors.

That's what it's going to do us in.

Yeah.

And thank God we serve Reba McIntyre.

Reba.

All right guys.

Um, I want to thank, uh, also everyone who worked on the show this year, um, in the booth over here at Engineer Sam, you did a lot of episodes.

Don't get on my, um, and you did a ton of episodes this year.

It's great.

All of our engineers, we got some new ones in this year and, um, some state even.

Yeah.

So yeah.

Uh, really great, uh, working with the people who work at the company here.

And, um, also the people, uh, who worked PCAST last, uh, last week, uh, our big festival that we hadn't in Los Angeles, uh, the, your wolf people and stitch her people who worked that really made it go smoothly.

Also in my, uh, assistant Corinne did a lot of work on that.

So, uh, shout out to her.

That one guy from the age who watched cops on his laptop.

That was so bizarre.

Strange.

What was his job?

I couldn't tell you.

I don't know what he was doing, but he was right there, uh, stage left the entire time watching cops on his laptop.

And he had a great seat and the best seat in the house instead watched cops.

I've been meeting catch up on the show.

What are all my favorite criminals up to?

Um, anyway, thanks to everyone.

Uh, we don't mean to get maudlin, but, uh, it, it means a lot to us that you listen.

Well, Paul, I want to thank you, especially for doing these with me every year.

Uh, it's really great.

You're a big part of the show and, uh, I hope you never quit it.

I hope you never quit me.

I hope I never get fired.

God, I, I love being a part of the show.

I'm going to buy you a phone by the way this year and you, you may receive a text on Christmas day.

Oh my God.

You remember from a million years ago when we started doing these best steps?

I love being part of the show and I love doing these best steps with you.

It's so fun.

I really look forward to it and it's always a good time.

Always a great time.

So thank you for, thank you for having me on the show.

My pleasure.

Uh, it truly is my pleasure and I hope, uh, even more than that, the audience's pleasure.

Um, that's going to be it.

I hope it's, who knows?

I hope it's our pleasure more than theirs.

Really?

You hope that we, I mean, I probably do get- We're the ones doing it.

I know.

I probably get more out of it than the audience does.

Well, but I think that makes sense.

Yeah.

It's your life's work.

Audience.

Take a breather.

It should be more enjoyable to us.

Don't listen to this.

It should.

No, they need to hear it.

Okay.

All right.

I'm not sure if it's the best thing that I've ever seen.

You're out of order.

No.

You're the doubles advocate.

Come on.

We're going to fly.

The jinx.

All right.

We will see it already is 2019 when you're hearing this, but we'll see you on Monday for the first episode of the year with Ben Schwartz and Horatio Sands.

It's going to be a great 2019 stick with us.

We'll see you later.

Thanks.

Goodbye.
