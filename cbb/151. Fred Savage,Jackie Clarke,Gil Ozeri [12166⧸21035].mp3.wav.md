was so very excited when you agreed to do the show oh i i loved it thank you twitter it brought us together yeah that is true building bridges that's sometimes how uh you can get great guests on your podcast for those of you doing podcasts is go just uh send someone a message on twitter this final i just i just refresh it all the time just looking for waiting for someone to reach out to me anyone don't need to have whatever it doesn't always turn out this well i showed to a lot of buildings on sunset boulevard uh have you been on wtf before no so i don't know what you're talking about yeah that guy man yeah yeah forget it yeah this is the one yeah this is it okay first of all before we continue uh i do have to ask did you win the mega millions last night you know i didn't but some might say you won life slaughtering because fred you have a fantastic career uh you uh you started out it as one of the world's most famous actors that's fair to say i don't think i don't know no do you did you did princess bride first before wonder years is that correct yes yes which right out of the gate classic princess bride was yeah that was a good one that's a good one but uh you know you didn't know you don't know that at the time sure you know working actor i was a little kid when i said you can't go to london i thought it was so cool um but uh that's been really well embraced they do these um i went to this uh Jason rightman just i wanted to ask you about this this is your right man yeah and so we we did uh i did one this week yes and then uh big libous yeah but i did uh they did a princess bride reading and they got a bunch of the cast together to read it and it's really it's really amazing how that's taken on its life of its own what part did you play did you play the original part or did you play the uncle no i played myself you played yourself i reprised my role wait were you playing yourself in the princess bride uh no but when i did savage himself a version of me um they uh but i so i i repr ised my role from 25 years before that's fantastic but it's amazing the uh the following that has gotten is incredible then you went on to the wonder years of course which uh you did five season six years on which is amazing i didn't uh personally i i did not see a lot of it because i i was in college and i wasn't watching a lot of tv i was watching a lot of pot put in my m r o u t h but for the kids the kids don't know what we're talking about but uh spell everything so so don 't worry i don't have a million questions about about the wonder years okay um i am i i think that's why i wanted to talk most about well you're here for the entire hour i i did i did because i don 't really know it i thought maybe what we could do is we could go episode by episode and you could tell me the plot to each one i'm i'm prepared to kind of give a live reading of any episode you want all the parts all the anyone you want any from any season except for really yeah not see the worst yeah what was going on and for that was uh i was in uh really a lot of changes going on for me and it was a period of transition going through a divorce at the time and just wasn't a lot of people don't know but you got married at uh about 13 years old yeah to my stand in yeah to your stand a really short squatty woman uh not very not very attractive as i recall no but a kind soul but it was almost like looking in the mirror for you which is what attracted you two are the similarities to me is what attracts me to most uh it was like making love to yourself my wives yeah exactly which a lot of people are into um but so how did you transition into into directing because i mean uh you know you can think of uh a lot of the sort of child actors who grew up to be become abnormal but you're you and michael sarah i think the are the two who both of us to be normal we hang out we talk about it a lot here and i you escape the trappings um no i uh i always wanted to do it when since i was a kid i thought it was you know it's i think it started from like i thought the cameras were really cool and again this is when these things were shot on film so i'd like go you know i would learn how to you know load the camera and take it apart and i just thought it was really interesting and how quickly could you take a camera apart and put it back together i 12 seconds i could well it depends on the different parts i could take a gear off of a camera to like i would annoy the cameraman um i could pull a gear off of the camera really fast really yeah why would you do that i don't know i just i was that that was how i acted out was that season four uh yeah that was season cameraman just really pissed off that's how i would act out i would act and i would i would take apart the camera or i would hide those are my big acting out moments hi i didn't know about pot then so i i was like i'm gonna rebel by you know seriously kids if if you need to just kind of relax if you need to if you're having trouble at home if you're having trouble in your life pot pot solution yeah i didn't know that then uh which is maybe why i'm here now um to score some but uh but we'll talk about that uh but um i think my dealer bro is coming by okay good uh i uh so i always wanted to do it and um i you know i you know i you know i i started my first job i directing i was doing i was acting i was this on working on working which it was a show that i really enjoyed by the way that a great cast artin m ering and dana ghoul dana ghoul yeah it was a great cast that was a really good show i really enjoyed that show it was it started off great and then it kind of got off on a weird tangent i think i liked it when it was on the weird tangent maybe it started off as it's like office comedy and then like season two which doesn't sound like a very long time but like the third episode it was about like a like a like a meteor was plummeting to earth and i kind of enjoyed that i like it became very surreal very quickly it became very surreal very quickly um but i um i directed one of those and you know to get you know to get to get an opportunity to direct you just kind of it's hard so you just kind of do it any way you can and so i you know to do it on your own show is an easy way to kind of start right and um but i wanted to see if i could do it and i i uh i really enjoyed it and then uh i went to i went i started my brother had a show on on television boy meets world right yeah um i know how you're all about boy meets world you're clueless about the world well even though i was i was out of college by then i was a big boy meets world fan i have to say that your commitment to your studies in college you're you're like the way you just immersed yourself in academia and shut out all pop culture i you know it's amazing you have to do it you become a success you're that's why you're so well read i mean because i had my uh doctorate of course my post-doctorate right no it's your commitment to education is to be applauded uh Fred what is your favorite word action or cut i mean action because it's there it's just a whole world of possibilities you know what i mean i've been playing with um create yeah as opposed to action that's i i haven't had the courage to do it yet but in my mind i do it i do it totally seriously create what what are you caught i don't like caught because cut zones feel so final so what do you know my least favorite words are company rap company rap yeah then i hate it then you back on the you're back on the doll i hate it yeah i never understood everyone when people would applaud and rap oh yay because then you're not of a job your job's over right you gotta go back on the back you know hit the hit the bricks and start combing for another job i agree with you i don't like rap don't like it don't like it at all because you know what then your creating is done that's right you know but that brings me back to i want us to plant cut with um pause because i don't think the creative process is over yeah no it does people people get this sense that okay cut i'm gonna stop learning yeah people have a cigarette they go out they call their agent to the texting or the car it's just a pause it 's just a pause in life you know what i'm just take a pause and let's juice is growing yeah learning you know let this let's just keep discovering where are we gonna go next now when you talk to your ad how do you let them know that oh no it is a total cut we're moving on like when you use how do you say pause pause moving on or what what do you say there i leave the stage you just without a word i walk off okay that's a good style for you i think you're gonna be very popular as a director i found it's working um and we should talk about uh bff which comes up this week which i'm very excited about i i have not seen the pilot i know it's online and people can watch the pilot but i like you're waiting for it what i experience it i like to see stuff on you know live with everyone else let's see who's buying ads who's sponsoring it exactly i love to keep track of stuff like taco and i love to sit i come to the office the next day i want to talk about it at the water cooler uh you know what i mean i like because look that's usually where i have the most fun at work you know we're in the water cooler yeah you know we're in these boring day jobs and you know you got to spend time at the office but you know i mean i love just hanging out with my friends at the water cooler and talking about what we saw the previous night so it's no fun when someone comes up to the water cooler like i remember the other day uh jerry came up to the water cooler and he was like oh guess what i saw online early the other day and i was like jerry i don't care but that's what i mean i feel like now with all these other outlets to watch things you could the water cooler conversation could start earlier that's true you just had a sync up we got you well that's the thing how do you sync up well with all with all your office mates texting so you're saying the company wide text of watch bff online tonight so we can all talk about

where'd you get why did you get rid of windford my sallish are you guys fans of the tonight show do you think did you think you were coming on the tonight show as i was like no the way that he pairs denim with denim is just a miracle oh my god Freddy you ever been on the tonight show i've been on the tonight show how many tell us a story uh which which incarnations by the way i was on uh the first time i did it was when when jay would get guessed for johnnie you guys know what jay would guess hole for john was it your tiny better self it was my tiny better so you would have loved it you would have loved it when you when you said better self well you're terrible now but you were perfect then i think he's pretty good now you would let you would you would his middle name is rumbling well uh so you were on as uh as uh that must have been before 1990 to do yeah so i did it with jay would guess host for johnnie and i did it with johnnie and then they would johnnie yeah did you sit on his lap i uh i did are you willing to sit on other people's lap i could uh i think now is not as a pro has been does a wonderful johnnie cast an impression i do you want to hear it of course absolutely uh let me push it in let me push it in what let me push it into you what johnnie karson that's j olly i don't remember him yeah that's actually pretty good oh okay well i have to take your word for it because that's pretty spot on i've never sat on his lap that's a spot on what's his last from the vantage point of his lap that's what you would hear what when johnnie would have every guest sit on his lap that was one of those things that i loved about the time i was i was one of the last jay doesn't do it in you know he never took that that on you know that was one of the things he got rid of when he was a concave lap oh is that the really the trouble he has a concave so people just disappear disappear oh yeah okay yeah maybe if he put a booster seat in his lap or something oh i guess such a genius oh god i love you you're so smart yeah just smart is pouring any money how do it's i i p s i love back rubs just putting it out there oh okay well i don't know if that'll really come up i just like back can i ask you it doesn't seem like you guys know uh Fred's work it doesn't seem like you know because we love it too much we've watched it all of it all of it i feel like she's familiar i think you stopped when when when did you stop i feel like you were familiar with my earlier work oh when you were tiny i can just tell we want to stop watching television when dreamon came on hb oh right and that was too too much for you it was too meta too salty meta i don't understand he wasn't in those movies i don't get it it it fucked without brain oh my god and ever since then we stopped i got to say that i think your brains were messed with a little bit earlier than that because it's a very sweet i was a regular sized person i don't like you same time i was a regular sized child very small you know that he wasn't an adult when he was in uh the most perfect adult child uh it seems to me like you guys had a very bizarre childhood where you were in some sort of holding holding facility i mean what do you call weird i mean everything's weird yeah this whole room is weird yeah so we bite we bite on the hood there's been a man sitting here who has not said one freaking word well no he's an engineer he's not what i'm talking about you're a weird weird one that guy right over there that guy he's wearing a parrot hat now you're not even pointing at the engineer you're pointing at just an empty space in the room okay this guy is crazy it's okay i know you don't see this guy over here thank you for inviting us into your nightmare what you you were raised without parents you were raised with just in in a garage or in a is like a nice room you're really pulling back some layers this couple well i'm just kind of what the bicelles were so pleasant and then you were really starting to get a set on covers this stuff i'm sorry i like to know a little bit about people said you're freaking a chef yeah you bacham man scott uh i mean that's one of the reasons that i mean i hate to bring it up again but this show is nominated for it's because you get in you get in depth what a water net me no not an image like an ash is it a people's choice award was it a gram the people do choose it was it a cable ace award no it's better than a cable and american music award i mean time will tell if kids choice holds up in the pantheon of awards i don't even know what it is but i think something called wtf is gonna win so guys you're your fans of the show you want to how did you enter the contest by the way i can't take an email to your hush fish worker email to you you guys have a caretaker yes how old are you by the way i didn't want to say i mean you can guess from their own age but somewhere between 70 and death but we won 't tell you specifically i'd say a little over the hill towards death okay well we it's a big hill it 's a huge hill huge hill first we have to first lots of dandy lines yeah we're coughing up blood now but we're not coughing up chunks but you guys are older you're an older couple it seems older sexually active couple that's nice it seems like you were sometimes with each other it seems like you were raised um by televisions even though you're at least 70 years old which seems to me like you were born at least in 1940 oh a genius so i mean and the television was invented before it became popularized in the 50s not a lot of programming not a lot of programming but i i think you know if people were to check out exactly when it was phylopharm's worth it you might da isy you're fighting flaws with our own enemy what is this well i regret this crime i mean god jesus holy crap i'm just saying your story checks out i like the television story is real you tell me come on you play along here you might have changed in what polandam guys what uh so so your fans of the show your caretaker called me up is that what you're saying email did she emailed you she said we could write some fan fiction for the show we love to write little playlets okay imagining some of our favorite people yeah we each wrote some fan fiction for you two little playlets for you guys to perform for us so you want us to perform yes you want us to perform fan fake what what and fan fiction for those of you don't know is people who aren't involved in the production uh write up little fictionalized stories and what is this a play

television you guys have final draft excuse me we do wind it now when did you get that was that nineteen format 1950 professional i thought this was gonna be we were all where we work we work in final draft yeah yeah did you guys it's fair the formatting is very professional here guys so pam he's gonna read the uh the uh the uh action lines stage directions i think sure it's interesting that you

that we're in Fred's goddamn billiards if you were joe oh great this would not happen they don't play pool they do not they sit and drink brandy and listen to selena the The original motion pictures soundtrack.

It's a fine night.

Fine night indeed.

I think I'll turn up the music.

Fred stands and walks to the CG player.

He bumps into Scott who spills his brandy.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Are you?

I am.

No, you're not.

You're a bad boy.

At 10 speed.

You're a bad boy.

You are a bad boy.

You're a bad boy.

Am I mad or are you a bad boy?

I am a bad boy, but you also are a bad, bad boy.

You're a bad boy.

Len's spinked by cell enters wearing a tuxedo coat with a diaper.

Gentlemen, gentlemen, stop fighting as it is.

I who is the bad boy.

Fred and Scott look at Len.

He's right.

They end the night in a tickle fight and come on his back.

OK, guys.

I feel like that's the end.

I think that you guys, as fan fiction, is kind of just an excuse to play out playbillards.

Because you are sick of it.

And you want to listen to Selena.

You're looking at the wrong part of this scene that you're taking on Bridge with.

It also says a lot about your character that you're listening to Selena, the original motion.

And there is a tension in here.

I'd like to back and forth.

I'm glad you're not.

Yeah, I'm glad you're not in trouble with the rest of it.

The thing about this one that you didn't like you didn't ruin this one.

I feel like coming on the back was earned more in the second one.

It definitely, I mean, we know a lot of people.

I felt that, right?

I felt good.

It feels good to stand toe to toe with one of America's most precious actors.

Curl toes to curl toes.

That was very sexy.

That was very nice, guys.

Thank you so much for bringing that.

Tell you all, why don't we take a little break?

Why don't you take a little break when we have sex?

And I didn't.

I didn't.

I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

I can tape record your sexual encounter with my modern dance.

Tell you what, let's go to a break.

When we come back, we'll have more from Pam and Len, more from Fred Savage.

We'll be right back with Comedy Bank.

âª Riding down on the road that's right on a big man âª âª Tying my shoes and smoking a cigarette I know âª âª Ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do âª âª I lay on down in a time I shoot âª âª Home cocaine, home cocaine âª âª Gonna ride that came train to you âª Comedy Bank, bang, bang.

We are back.

We're here with Fred Savage.

He was been nice enough.

We somehow got sidetracked in that last segment.

I feel like I don't.

I just feel like I could have brought it a little harder with that first game.

Still thinking about it?

Definitely could bring it harder.

Once you step back into that acting arena, I know it's got its claws and eye-acting.

What you want to think is what would Tiny Fred Savage do?

And always do that.

Yeah, I have.

I do that.

W-W-I-T-S-D.

Don't talk about WTF, please.

Oh yeah.

Oh my God.

That was a plug.

All right, it's time now.

Harassment.

It's time now on the show to play one of our favorite features.

It's time to play a little game called Would You Rather?

This is awesome.

Incredible intro.

Very much.

I love the intro.

Please, I'm begging you.

Don't talk during the intro.

When can playsactophone with his butt?

I wish that was longer.

Guys, when we play Would You Rather, we have to sit through the theme song.

I gave me time.

Pardon parcel of playing the game.

I liked it.

They gave me time to think about both of y'all's feet.

All right, now none of you have played this before.

This is quite exciting.

We all know how this is played though, at least the listeners do.

I will, of course, read a Would You Rather scenario.

Send to us on Twitter.

You can send us these at CBB-WIR, Comedy Bang Bang, Would You Rather.

We have listeners and viewers.

Send us Would You Rather scenarios.

I will read them out loud.

I will then open the floor for questions.

As we all know, the scenarios are merely part of the story.

There's all sorts of details you can ask me about.

Ask me any kind of question about any of the scenarios.

What size foot do you have?

That may come into play.

I, of course, have not opened the floor for questions yet.

I'm a pal.

I'm going to have to dock you.

That is negative three points.

So you'll be starting at negative three.

Fred, you'll be at zero.

Len, you'll be at zero.

Those are our scores right now.

Very misogynist.

So I'm going to read this scenario here, and then I'll open the floor.

This comes to us from Charles Doyle.

Charles Doyle asks, I believe that actually sounds like a real name.

Is your name sound like the fake names?

Charles Doyle asks, would you rather have a banshee scream directly into your ear the second you fall asleep every night for the rest of your life?

Or peace skyscrapers?

Would you rather have a banshee scream directly into your ear the second you fall asleep every night for the rest of your life?

Or peace skyscrapers?

I am opening the floor for questions.

Wait, peace?

Like peace on earth, good world towards man?

We have to pass this guy.

Okay.

Before we visited that guy scraper in New York, we were really starting at zero with you.

Oh, good.

If I'm going to have to explain words to you.

The way you talk wasn't so weird.

P is one word, and then skyscrapers.

Well, if you know anything about me, you know that I like things going into my chip and out of my chip as well.

So I don't even know what that means.

Peace skyscrapers.

Peace Okay, now Len, you voted before the voting.

Oh, so as a huge, as a huge super fan of the show, I think you would know exactly how they get in the play.

I think it's really a teeing something solid.

Well, see, that's part of the scenario.

So Len, I'm afraid I'm going to have to dock you 10 points.

Yes.

Very misogynist.

Pam, you're still at negative three.

Fred, you're in the lead right now at zero.

If you do nothing, you may win.

I'm going to coast through.

But no, please.

Trust me, any questions about either of the scenarios, the particulars about either.

What would you do?

See that again, that's not how this game is about that.

Okay, so this is a huge, how do you actually have a skysc raper come out of you?

So does your, your wreath are wrong?

Would open.

Wait, would you say is it wrong?

No, does your urethra?

Your urethra what?

Yeah.

Only girls have that.

Your urethra.

Urethra.

Does it expand like a vagina when you give a baby out?

And unfortunately, of course, from your back story, you would not know about that.

No, I don't.

First hand.

But yes, it does, as a matter of fact.

It, it, uh...

So it expands.

Oh, so I would...

It expands and then contracts.

I would pierce skyscraper then.

I feel like the first time would be terrible.

The first time would be terrible.

Fred, you voted before...

Are you going to dock him?

Yeah, I'm afraid I'm going to have to dock you 11 points because you should have known better after, after his...

What are you supposed to vote?

Well, you ask me a lot of questions and then I close the floor for questions because there's particulars that you don't know about.

It's a really detailed question.

It is, but there's all sorts of details you don't know about.

For instance, you don't know...

Well, okay, I have a question.

Banshee.

Does he scream once or does he scream consistently?

Exactly.

See, that...

Now we're getting into the news.

Ah!

Because it's said, as it is written, he screams directly into your...

Every time you fall asleep...

The second you fall asleep every night for the rest of your life.

Yes, every single time you fall asleep...

What kind of penis do I have?

A good question.

Is it a good question?

I could tell you...

Is it a building-sized penis?

I'll tell you right because if it is, that would be normal.

I will answer that.

Yes, it is a building-sized penis.

Oh.

It is slightly smaller than the skyscrapers that you're pee ing out, though.

So it still is very, very difficult and painful.

What size homo-e-in?

Like a skyscraper size home?

Meaning just in which scenario, by the way?

Well, I don't want to pee out a skyscraper and then have no room for it.

Like room.

Are we giant people?

Question.

Is the... how aroused am I getting from this banshee?

Let me answer your questions one at a time.

So are you in a skyscraper?

I believe it was first from Pam.

Yeah, how big is that at home?

Yeah, it is a normal-sized home to your body.

But answering Fred's question, you are giants.

Yes.

So you're peeing out skyscrapers that are tinier than your bodies.

So you are giants who are the size of six skyscrapers.

You are one to six.

Well, you're needing out something that's the sixth of our size.

Exactly.

Which is pretty big.

Pretty big still and painful.

But you have a skyscraper-sized penis, which is a sixth of your body, which is also pretty big.

I think I know my vote.

Please don't.

I'm begging you, guys.

I'm begging you.

I'm going to disqualify all of you.

What gender is this?

What is this?

Now, what?

It's Radio's Kiss Out.

Glenn is just blowing the kisses at you.

Glenn, I feel like this game has decid- Glenn, I haven't even answered your question.

Oh, yeah, yeah.

What's the question?

How aroused are you by the banshee?

How aroused, are we?

It's a- no, I'm supposed to answer this.

Oh, okay.

It's a female banshee.

Does that tell you anything?

Yes, that means I choose the skyscrapers immediately.

I don't even- Again, I'm going to have to dock you another 12 points because you, of all people sitting down better, you're at negative 20.

Two.

So I'm going to leave right now.

No, no, no, no, no.

You're a negative 22.

As we all know, negative numbers are positive.

So we're at- currently, Pam, you're in the lead at negative three, even though you keep threatening to vote.

Yeah, well, I'm ready.

I know what my vote is.

Well, still we have- I close the floor at this point.

Fred, you have another question?

In the skyscraper scenario, you're giant living upon the earth.

Oh, I mean, we haven't even established that.

Where are you living?

Where am I living?

You're in the cloud kingdom.

Okay, I'm in the cloud.

And I can sleep- I can sleep fine.

I'm well rested.

No, you have a banshee screaming in here.

That's the other part of the scenario that- see, and this is why you ask the questions.

Oh, this is a real twist because I was all- he's about to skyscraper.

You have a banshee in this scenario, you have a banshee screaming in your ear only once a night.

Ooh.

Just once a night?

Just once a night.

That's easy peasy, Japanese.

Yeah.

So in the first scenario, I was on board skyscraper with a regular sized penis like I'm going to much today.

Well, it's not a regular size.

It's a sixth of your body.

I don't know if that's regular for you, but it's- No, no, but before I knew any of this, I'm still not voting.

Please don't vote.

So we have one scenario where a banshee screams every single time you fall asleep, so you never get a good night's rest.

Ever.

And then the other scenario, you're a giant living in a cloud kingdom.

You have a penis which is about the size of the six of your body.

So about a foot.

You pee out skyscrapers which are slightly bigger than the size of your body.

Are they liquidy skyscrapers or are they like actual brick and mortar?

Great question.

They are liquidy and they freeze the minute that they exit your body.

So it's just liquid.

So people are still able, people in the- Down on earth, down below, are still able to live in these urine.

What's the pitch of the banshee?

What's his pitch?

Do you mean- Do you mean- Do you mean- What is the note that he hits because that could make me shake?

You know what I mean?

The flat which as we all know is the highest note that Tony sings and whistles.

That'll make it shake.

Like the same.

When you say it cools off into a building, is it hot?

What you're peeing on is it hot molten building?

No, it is- The IP is not hot.

I feel so over here.

I mean- Well, here's what happens.

Your pee is hot.

Your pee is scalding hot as a matter of fact.

But the minute it enters the atmosphere, this is in the future by the way.

Right.

When- But it passed for a second.

I'm not a doctor, but there's something wrong.

No, it's something- I don't know what's wrong.

It's going to be something very right.

Is this some fetish that you're into as people with pee colds?

Look, have I been looking for someone who can pee cold maybe?

I just want to say that if you can pee cold, there are people who need to talk to you.

And one of them is me tonight.

You don't have to wait till tonight.

You could probably do it right after the show.

Imagine, imagine cold- Chinese, French savage, tinkle and cold.

Is that the only part that you don't like about someone pee ing on you?

Is this how- I wouldn't have to store it in my fridge for hours before we used it.

It just saves you a bunch of time.

So in this scenario, it's in the future when global warming has happened and the entire atmosphere is cooled down to such the extent that the only way anyone can build anything is from your pee skyscrapers, which immediately frees and the humans down below are able to live inside.

So you're doing- you're doing- A servant.

The human's a great favor.

Yeah, in fact, they gaze upon you as a god of sorts.

And there's a banshee who screams into your- Just once, I think you're trying to push us in one direction.

I'm not because you haven't asked me anything about the other scenario in the banshee.

The banshee is so boring.

Why do you dispose of waste now?

How do you dispose of waste?

Well- Personal waste.

You do not have any kind of holes in your body.

So it basically just builds up inside of you.

So it's like we are now.

Wait a minute.

It's like we are now.

Wait a minute.

Yes.

You don't have any kind of crevices?

What do you mean?

I think that's why I like things going through my dip.

Wait, that would be one of the holes.

Not a hole, sir.

Just a tap.

Just a solid tip.

Just a brown helmet.

Then how does anything go into it?

Who says things go in?

Wait, you said it.

It's the attempt.

It's the attempt that's really delicious.

So in the first scenario, you're constantly interrupted by this banshee.

You are unable to dispose of waste which causes infections in you and you balloon up to several times your size.

Wait, wait, wait.

So we're getting screamed out of banshee.

Yeah.

And we can't tinkle a defecate.

Correct.

And you're constantly sick from this.

You really want us to pit at the other one.

But you guys haven't asked the importance of the questions about that one.

The questions are just there.

You've just said it.

And you just continue to expand.

That's loading inside you like an aquarium.

You guys haven't talked about how much money you made.

Oh, you're so smart.

As what?

Tell me.

What's the profession that a sleep, that a tire and shit filled.

You have a great job as a legal aid.

As a legal aid.

And you make a lot of money as a legal aid.

You make a good living.

You make about $40,000 a year.

Oh, my God.

I thought you were going to say 25 bucks.

$40,000 could change one's life.

A year.

When you do this, you do that thing where you rub your.

Yeah, I rubbed my fingers together to imply that it was a lot of money.

Yeah.

Do that's not a lot of money to you.

I don't know how much money you make as a director.

Um, is it more than 40,000?

Is that dickage of me that looked down at $40,000 a year?

I mean, a lot of Americans out there would be happy to have 40,000 a year.

Well, it had some, you know, a friend.

I mean, I know you're in the entertainment industry.

Where do you live in Manchinville?

Where do you live in?

In Zillionaire City?

Yeah.

Population Fred Savage.

And Scott Ockerman.

I'm trapped on the hill of money and gumdrops.

God, on a big, gold tooth.

Just a penis made out of diamonds.

Yeah, I mean, but you haven't asked about how much you make in the other scenario either.

Oh, I didn't even think that we, these questions would exist.

I didn't, I wasn't even thinking about the money.

In the other $40,000 and the money's a wash.

Let's find out.

No, no, in the other scenario, you make 35,000.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

So it's, it's considerably a better living.

But is it like when you go to Mexico and you like, so does like a thousand pesos?

Oh, yeah.

You're like, is it though?

What's that?

Currency exchange.

It is in the future.

So we got to talk about it.

So 40 grand would be like really nothing.

Well, you make 35 as a giant in the cloud kingdom.

What year is it then?

It's in the future.

So it's, I think it's 2013.

35 what?

35,000.

35,000 what?

What's the unit of currency?

It's 35,000 credits, of course.

The futuristic currency that we all credit.

I have the question.

Did you get all this information from the fake gentleman from Twitter?

No, no, no.

I know all in each of these scenarios.

After the apocalypse, our cage takeover.

Everything is run with credit.

Oh.

And tokens.

You have to pay with tokens.

I want a little ring that's a gumdrop.

So the currency exchange rate in this scenario is $35,000 or 35,000 credits equals about $41,000 in this scenario.

Oh my god.

So you're making a little bit more.

A lot more.

And is it also $2,000?

I don't pretend that you think $41,000 is a money.

Yeah, come on.

Don't pretend that $1,000 a year means anything to you.

Well, you're saying $1, one of the 35 is $41,000 or $35,000 ?

I think $35,000 is to $41,000.

When is the $41,000?

That's also $21,000.

I'm not saying that.

Are you taking that?

No, we're getting bogged down in this currency exchange.

You're making it about money now.

I was into the altruism of pissing buildings, but you're all of a sudden about the green.

I have a question for Johnny Fred Savage.

Johnny Fred Savage.

Well, when you look at the medicine cabinet in your bathroom.

Are you asking Fred Savage of your?

No, the current tiny Fred Savage.

Oh, okay.

Not missing.

It's not really nice to call him.

No, but he's so tiny.

It used to be.

Wait, he used to be so tiny.

Pam, what is your question?

When you go to your bathroom and you want to use a cute tip and you go into your medicine cabinet, are they just rolled up $100 bills?

That's a good question.

And what does your dick look like?

It's part B.

Part B's.

Please, Len.

Guys, you haven't asked the most pertinent question I feel about the giant scenario.

What is the Banshees name?

That probably is not the most permanent question.

All right.

I got it wrong.

John Cuebanchi.

It's about the fact that in the Banshees scenario, crack cocaine does not exist.

Oh.

So, weigh that into, I mean, you know.

And then what do you get crack cocaine?

Exactly.

There isn't any.

But in the other scenario where you're a giant person who has piss and shit building up in you and you make $40,000 a year as a legal aid, crack cocaine does exist and you are able to buy some.

Well, I have one final question.

Yes.

Why are you...

It's because...

You're deciding that this is the final question.

For me, for myself.

For myself.

What is the scenario?

Which side is the scenario where you can tell people who you really are and you don't have to hide?

I don't think that you've been hiding anything.

Why are you looking at me as you say that?

You are the most transparent in the closet person that I've ever met.

In the closet, not sure what that means.

All right.

Any other questions about either of these scenarios?

Oh, yeah.

Does the Banshees look like Johnny Mathis?

Johnny Mathis.

Why?

Would you be into that?

Oh, I'd be that very into that.

Then, yes.

The Banshees in the former scenario who constantly is screaming into your ear looks like Johnny Mathis.

So then what do you have the voice of Johnny Mathis?

Because then that scream...

He has the golden tone.

Beautiful.

Very dull.

The melodious voice of Johnny Mathis.

But I'm still fully shitting piss.

Veen is sif you, Hill.

That's my Johnny Mathis impersonation.

I won't continue it because I don't want to expect it.

I'm sorry to say it, everyone.

Don't.

I'm tittering.

Any other questions here before we close the floor?

Are both of you alive in either scenario?

Just...

Both of you...

You, Seth and you, Fred, are both of you alive in either scenario.

We are alive in the former scenario where the Banshees constantly screaming at us but not in the latter scenario.

Thank you.

All right.

Is that no longer an option for me?

Well, for you, you are still alive in whatever scenario you 're in.

Okay.

Yeah.

We all have different realities that we have a lot of math written down.

There's a complex equation.

He's taking you seriously out of the sense.

I have another...

I have one final question for myself.

Okay, Pam.

Does TV exist in any of these realities?

Why do you...

You don't watch it anymore.

Okay, I have one more question.

All two.

What?

Reality.

Can I listen to the mock mare in WTF podcast?

None of them.

Neither scenario.

Wow.

That's good, big and tough.

I've never heard it but I hear it's great.

But Brian Ben Ben is on everything.

He's every character and every television show.

I've talked about a tiny man.

All right.

I'm now closing the floor for questions and I'm going to ask you how you vote.

Fred, how do you vote?

Which scenario do you like better?

I'm going to go...

I've been pretty wired a wire on the skyscraper thing.

Yeah, where you're a giant up in the heavens.

People worship you.

You are benevolent.

You pee skyscrapers allowing for your subjects to have shelter.

You have a...

35 grand a year, which is 41.

41.

Yeah, you make 35 credits.

35,000 credits.

And your penis is relatively big for your frame.

I'm really just going off of I'm not...

I can expel waste and I can sleep.

Yes.

I'm basing on those two factors alone.

So you really enjoy expelling waste.

And sleeping at different times.

You ever done it at the same time?

Yes, I have.

Oh, I bet that's a story.

Which one?

Number one, number two.

What are we talking at this time?

We've all done number one.

You know what I mean?

I've never shit in my sleep, but as an adult, I have shit myself.

Awake.

Yeah, well, I'll shit yourself awake.

Yeah.

Then that's shitning your sleep.

Wait, you were sleeping?

You shot and then woke up because it's late.

That's like a better shitning your sleep.

That is shitning your sleep.

That is the text of a definition.

I was awake.

I was awake from start to finish during the shitting.

Wait, are you saying that you woke up and immediately shit?

No, I'm saying you were a story about my day.

My friend.

You didn't have to freeze it like I might be.

I should myself awake is a weird way because then you think that you're shitting your girl like sleeping, sleeping, sleeping.

While I was sleeping.

Shit, oh my God.

Like that's your alarm clock.

It's like you're shitting yourself.

I said it every night.

All right.

Well, Fred.

Skyscraper.

Skyscraper is your vote.

All right.

Now let's go over to Pam.

Pam, how are you liking to vote here?

I think I'm going to go with the Banshee.

Not just because of Johnny Mathis, but because the scourge of crack cocaine would be obliterated.

No, no, no.

The scourge of crack cocaine is obliterated in the giant scenario.

Oh, I'll still go with Johnny, man.

Okay, so it's really just that.

Yeah, that's the main thing.

Okay.

All right.

Len, how do you like to vote?

The former, please, the Banshee.

The Banshee.

So we have two for the Banshee, which is not the obvious choice.

It's not the obvious choice, but you two are alive.

Oh.

And the possibility.

The possibility of you coming on my back is true.

Oh, let's shut this down.

All right.

We wanted to know why we chose.

All right.

So we have two for the Banshee and Fred, you're the only person who voted for the skyscraper.

I'm just so weird because you shoot your pants as your alum .

And I would like to have you know that the skyscraper was the right choice, which gets you 10 points.

So that brings me up to negative one.

Negative one.

And that puts you ahead of Pam.

Who was it?

Negative three.

And Len, you were at negative 22.

You had no shot at this.

There's a shot at losing.

But that means Fred, you are our winner.

Congratulations.

And that is of course how we play.

Would you rather?

Wow.

That was so good.

Oh, God.

Is there a conclusion?

This is the same one.

This is the theme.

We have to listen to the theme.

But you can celebrate your victory while we listen to the ...

Oh, God.

Thank you.

I'm very excited.

We don't have to do it silently for the outro just merely for the intro.

I'm very pleased with the victory.

Have you ever won anything before?

I've been nominated for a lot of things.

Really.

Me too.

Never won.

You've never won anything?

I was reading today that you were nominated for a Razzie.

I was not.

I did not win that either.

That's unfortunate.

But it's an honor to be nominated as you know.

It is a one production.

It's a one production.

But what production?

You want to know what award I did win?

Yeah.

And my competition.

Mm hmm.

I have it under my sink.

Not your sink.

Yeah.

Was it the plumbers award?

Two people's choice awards.

You don't say.

Oh wow.

That's how you feel about the people.

Why do you keep them under your sink?

I didn't know where else to put them.

Because you don't want to be awesome.

How about on a goddamn mantle.

I tell you.

And this is my pledge to you.

If I win these goddamn combos.

You want to go?

They're going up on my mantle.

Sweetheart, you're not going to.

I'm going to pull the lavar burden and just put my by my fireplace.

I don't need known for him yet.

Well, there's a famous humble brag picture that he put up all of his Emmys like above his fireplace.

And it tweeted it.

I don't think for reading rainbow or some shit like that.

Yeah, it's not for like next generation.

No, that would be.

Although, you may want something for roots.

I don't know.

Oh, maybe.

You want a lot of Emmys.

Yeah, for reading rainbow.

That just cleaned up.

Oh my God.

People love to fucking read.

Alright guys, that is just about it for the show.

We only have one last thing which is of course plugs.

I'm going to go electric and I'll have some plugs.

Maybe where you're going to be.

Come on, let me play the music.

It's a very musical shell.

A few of my love and my what's up memorial hot dog.

Oh, nice and short.

Like that.

Fans of the show know Jessica St. Clair.

I think stars Jessica St. Clair stars that in par.

He wrote it and created it and and star in it and.

Wow, when did they sleep?

I don't think so.

And it's pretty, yeah, premieres Wednesday.

And Pam and Len, do you have anything to plug by?

I'm a stretch of imagination.

You just have Twitter feed.

And nephews have Twitter feed.

Oh, I would love to follow.

It's at Pam and Len's nephew.

Dot.

You don't have to put any good dot.

And nephew Kevin does hair cutting at the flare cuts in.

But also don't you have relatives who worked on that show Happy Endings and they have their big season finale.

Yes.

So just keep your TV on.

You will have to change.

Please flick it over.

Just change.

Just get push it over.

Push those buttons.

But also Dream on is on coming out on DVD.

I think it's on Netflix.

The complete series or did they cherry pick and make the best ones?

It's the best stuff.

It's almost impossible to.

It's with that girl from Just Shoot Me.

I want to plug.

First of all, I want to give a shout out to Martha E. Wil mont for sponsoring the studio for a day.

I'm not Mark Merrion.

You voted incorrectly.

Okay.

Fred Savage, can you say hi to your tiny self for me?

I'd like to say hi to Fred Savage.

Do you say hi to yourself, your tiny self every night before you go to bed?

In your prayers?

I try and tell him it's going to be okay.

Yeah, that it's going to be okay.

You're going to get through season four.

Yeah.

You're going to get to see the side anymore.

It's going to be fine.

You don't have to listen to Steve Wood and Woods back in the high life again.

Okay.

Mm hmm.

Little blue eyed soul.
