♪♪♪ There once was a man from Nantucket, his name was Ven, and I think he's old health insurance. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Hmm, thank you to Chast Free Month III for that Castphrase submission, Chast Free Month III, and welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

We have a great week. I tell you, after a few months where we had zero celebrities, no one wanted to come to my backyard.

Maybe we had a David Cross once in a while, you know, here and there, but, you know, when you invite people to a backyard, celebrities mainly don't want to go there. We're finally back in the studio. We're all in August. We are just, the stars are out.

The stars are out in the night sky. Who do you guys showing up?

I don't want to say who we have. We had Pat in last week. I mean, it's all people I know. Holy shit. Wow. Holy shit.

But we do have a big Hollywood star coming up a little later. We do have a celebrity chef. We have a lawyer coming up a little bit later.

And yeah, our main guest played a lawyer on television and is still playing a lawyer. He has another couple of episodes of his show.

It's called I. Cal Sal, what is it called again? God, I get Sal. God, I get Sal.

There is another episode tonight. If you're listening to this today, it comes out. There's the final episode next Monday night.

No, no. There's four more. Well, we're taking the same season. Oh, I guess, yes, as we discussed previously.

I don't know how radio or podcast. I'm on tour right now. I'm all I'm across the United States. I'm not here in the studio, unfortunately.

But yes, there's two more episodes. One tonight. Wait, is everything I see on TV pre-taped? Yes, even the news. Even sports.

What? Yeah, it's all happening five days earlier. The moon landing? That was the only thing that was launched.

I wonder I always lose in the casino. I keep talking about casinos. Yeah, I know. We were talking about casinos before.

You got casinos on the mind.

And maybe that is a glimpse inside the twisted mind of our main guest here. He's got dollar signs behind his eyelids.

I love you. I love you so twisted. So weird. So strange. He's got to be on drugs. I know you got to be on drugs to do the things you do.

Not at all. And it's not actually you show up. You show up pretty early in you. Yeah, it's like it's never that I'm usually the things that that's brought up around are not that weird.

Well, it's also not your current life is weird. It's I remember when David and I did a comic relief eight. I remember that.

And we did a naked. We did a naked phrase guest, but also as well, we did a brief moment where we did a fake infomercial.

Hey, get the comic relief t-shirt if you donate 50 bucks.

Well, can you use it for it'll protect you against spaghetti and watermelon and pizza pie?

All that shit. That joke. Yes. And it's just a fucking fun riff. Sure. And when we were and it got laughs, it was great.

And when it was done, the deer and I like her whoopie Goldberg goes, what was I don't know what they're on. I remember that.

That was like, it was a fake infomercial. We did the dumbest, most obvious, most horny, decolese thing.

What do you mean? Maybe the examples of the jokes were a little far out there. I remember that being a sticky.

A sticking point in the office for months after that. I remember you guys flying back. There's a lot of things you could say. She could have said, no, that was hacky.

Sure. That would have been fine. I would have been like this one. That's no sister act too.

Yeah. Well, he's here. I still haven't introduced him yet, but Balcal Sal is coming up and let's welcome him back.

My old Mr. Show buddy, Bob Odenkirk, many hamburgers to you.

And many hamburgers right back. Thank you so much.

I appreciate you.

Cheeseburgers in fact.

What?

Yeah.

You never added cheese to our traditional greeting. This is exactly the type of weird twist in mind.

I'm a gen.

Yeah.

Wow.

Incredible.

You are on drugs, Bob. Are you hot? Bob, welcome back to the show. Great to have you.

You've been on since the early days. We've known each other for now. You knew me since I was a 25 year old boy.

Now you're like a 40 year old boy.

It's like 20.

49.

43.

Do you think I'm 43? I love that. I don't know how many people they are.

I appreciate it. I was thinking about when we first met each other how I was but a boy.

And I thought you were so much older than me. And I don't think you were. But...

I was probably 32 when we worked together. And it's like how...

33.

You know, how can you ever expect like and you were in charge and you were a 33 year old kid?

No.

Right?

But you seem like an old guy to me.

Well, I had a kind of an old guy energy. Don't you think?

Plus you would spank us all.

Well, I was naked. Give me that. I mean...

We could agree on that.

I'm not gonna be some slack.

I was totally naked and greased up.

I didn't just spank you.

I agree.

All right, fine.

It was sexual.

Yes.

Okay.

So now I'm just trying to hurt people.

But it is funny that...

Trying to get off.

In show business we give these like boss roles to young kids just because they create a show.

That's really good.

Right.

And then you have to be in charge of a whole bunch of people.

Well, I was a Saturday Night Live writer and that helped me know a bit about production.

Because you kind of are put in charge of your pieces there.

Right.

And so, yeah, I had some...

And you knew what I'd been at the Stiller Show.

Right.

And you knew what you didn't want to do from pretty new jobs.

Oh boy, do I know.

Yeah.

Right.

You didn't want it to be on Saturday.

You didn't want it to be live.

Yeah.

And definitely not at night.

No.

Never.

No.

Early mornings.

Yes.

Sometimes this one wouldn't be up.

Let's be honest.

Because we would come on at 6 a.m.

Depending on the time zone.

Right.

And that was it felt a little like cheating.

Right.

But those are my rules.

And we did it.

And it came off with...

You had eight simple rules.

Right.

For putting on a television show with your teenage daughter.

David Cross.

That's right.

You guys...

Of course that was the past.

The present is...

I thought talk about the past.

Oh God.

I mean, you're probably doing a whole shit ton of press for better...

What is this shit called?

Got a gal cell.

Got a gal named Sal.

And is all the press done or do you still have more because the finale is coming in?

There's more.

Okay.

Always more.

Until next Emmy season.

So like another year?

Probably.

Yeah.

It will be the last six or whatever or seven will be.

Vodable or whatever.

Yeah.

So you'll have to keep kind of back.

I don't know what's going to happen.

But I think that we're...

This is our big final run here.

I mean maybe we'll get a shot next year.

But the last episodes are playing now.

And I think there's some of our best work.

So I think we got a...

This is the time to tell people if you like the show, give us a tick the box.

But we were talking before you were telling...

I don't want to spoil this necessarily.

But you were saying that this is a fake out, that this is a fake last season and there's actually one more season.

Yeah.

I mean it's not...

It's probably a spoiler.

But...

I guess it's a spoiler.

We're going to do a whole other like five more seasons.

Right.

Because we're only gonna...

We're not going to tell anyone.

Right.

Or have it broadcast in any way.

So that they'll continually be shocked and surprised at the news that, wait they're doing more?

Yeah they couldn't believe it.

They...

I tell written.

I mean some of it is shot.

Well everything...

You guys wrote everything on five years in advance usually.

Yeah most of the show was written 15, 20 years ago actually before I even...

I was in show business but only marginally.

I heard that episode was one...

Episode one was written while the creator was like having sex with his wife and like...

Like actually like...

God was having sex with his creator?

Yeah.

No I mean...

Who is God's wife?

When you think about it.

It's weird that he's a lonely bachelor isn't it?

Mother nature.

Okay yeah they get it on the box.

Oh God.

No.

But you were telling me that...

Isn't that kind of a harmless observation?

Yeah.

You could say God's wife is Mother Nature.

Yeah it's horrible.

Who's gonna get mad?

Who's gonna get mad at Mother Nature?

It's not some god from some other religion.

Exactly.

It's just a generic...

Yeah.

You know everybody...

Embodiment and personification of the world.

Of goodness and earth and nature.

Yeah yeah yeah.

You were telling me the last episode of this season of Better Cow Ballet.

The middle season is...

Yeah.

It ends with Bob...

The Bob character.

You play Bob right?

I'm Bob.

I play a character named Bob Odenkirk.

Right.

Which is so lucky for me.

Right.

That my name also.

Otherwise he would get confusing on set.

Where they're like Bob we're ready for you.

Right.

Yeah.

It ends like...

I'd be like who's a character I'm so...

Whatever.

Yeah.

I play a character named Bob Odenkirk.

Right.

Who's gotten the job as Saul Goodler.

Right.

And he has to act like this Saul Goodman guy.

And he's...

Yeah.

He's acting and he's also constantly checking his rating.

He's constantly checking his ratings to see how his show's doing.

Right.

He's very, very interested in that.

And so he's constantly injecting excitement and energy and drama into this otherwise bland job, simple job.

Right.

A guy with a pretty boring anodyne life with two children and a wife.

And the thing that was so hard about doing it, Scott, was I'd never been a lawyer.

And I had to pass the bar.

Right.

You know, this is what you have to do.

Yeah.

Jared Leto.

I believe it's pronounced.

I think he'd prefer everyone change it to Leto.

He'd prefer we all change it to Leto?

Yeah.

All right.

This is going to be a lot of paperwork for me, but okay.

Jared Leto and Bronson Pinchot.

They got together on this toe and show.

Called me from SAG.

They both called me at the same...

Hello, Jared.

They called you at the same time.

When I got the job.

You get a call from a SAG representative.

And those two are there to say, you know, listen, you are very lucky.

You are in the club.

But you have to do, you know, you have to...

You can't just pretend, you know, you have to do this thing.

You have to do the research.

So they had me lose weight.

Then I had to gain weight.

Then they just dialed it in perfectly.

Right.

So it was like a pound less than I was when I started this whole fucking thing.

So they said lose weight pounds.

You lost 40 and had to gain like 60.

And then...

Oh wait, you were just testing me to see if I had the schmutz.

And then I got the right weight and then I had to pass the bar and then I had to, you know, change my name, just call Goodman and...

Right.

Oh, you changed your illegally.

Oh, wow.

Yeah.

Or did you do illegally?

Oh, I did it legally.

You did illegally.

Okay, great.

All the way up to the Supreme Court.

I mean, this is a...

They took that case.

Wow.

Okay.

Almost every...

You hear about the big ones.

Abortion, whatever.

You only hear about the big ones.

But they do the little tiny ones all the time.

Can this guy change his name?

Can that guy change his name?

Oh my God.

My license was expired.

You know.

They took care of that?

Have you ever gone to court?

I mean, it goes up to the Supreme Court very quickly.

Yeah.

Well, I once got a parking ticket that I didn't show up for.

Yeah.

Well, if you had...

Right.

Odds are...

They just kick it upstairs?

They keep kicking it upstairs.

Oh my God.

And the nine justices, there's only nine.

This is where we should be.

Oh, yeah.

We need more.

The wonderful nine.

Three hundred.

Four hundred.

I would...

I mean, thousands.

Why not?

Why not every...

You know, it's better than a million?

A billion, as I said in...

Right.

The social network.

Not starring Bob Odenkirk, our guest today.

I once wrote a sketch for Saturday Night Live called The Jillian Air.

And he was the guy who helped billionaires when they were low on funds.

What would he do?

He would loan the money or he would just like...

He would be like, you're in trouble and I'm going to help you.

I'm going to give you a couple million dollars you need to carry you or tide you over.

And it was like...

Yeah, he did...

That was the adventure.

We like find a billionaire in trouble and help him.

What happened to that sketch?

Can I ask?

It didn't get on.

What?

But you were telling me, Bob, that the very last episode of this season ends with you turning to camera and doing the de Kembe Matumbo and going, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, back or back next season.

I actually don't know that reference.

I actually...

Is that a TikTok thing?

TikTok thing, it's sports.

He would wag his finger all the time at the crowds because they would be booing him.

This is what I don't know.

I'm looking to my sports guy over here and he's on the phone.

I've never seen it, but I'll have to check it out.

But you do wag your finger.

At the end of the episode, it's a spoiler for probably pretty much everybody, but I do look into the lens and I wag my finger and it's kind of a told you so caught you.

Gotcha.

Katcha.

Made you look at the whole series.

I did that.

Because you were on right before the finale of Breaking Bad many years ago, one of our earlier episodes, and you spoiled that episode for us, which ended with Walter White's son on the skateboard, his legs were fixed.

You said, look what I can do.

I remember you telling us.

And so I just want a similar spoiler.

You know, it's like, look, well, what happens in the end?

You we know that this character saw Jimmy, whatever Jean Bob Odenkirk, right, gets a sex change.

Surprisingly, Kim, the woman he loves, she gets a sex change and they can and they do face off surgery as well.

They do.

And then they are together again as a couple forever.

Incredible.

This is big news.

Yeah.

And they do live forever.

That's kind of a that the show.

So they're like, eternals or maybe.

In mortals.

Immortal.

Do they have that surgery?

How did they get that?

That is actually an accident of what are they hit by a card and suddenly?

No, the tanning booth that they go in and something's wrong.

They switches off and got it.

She lives forever.

Oh, okay.

Got it.

Yeah.

It's not important.

It's a great idea for a show.

It's like, but barely you.

Oh, you're okay.

So the two going to be about them as a couple, the next couple seasons are them as a couple.

Do they get vocal surgery as well?

Where they switch voices or is it the same voices, but in different bodies now?

Well, that's the challenge production wise because I'm going to have to record all my lines into her voice and her voice will go into my voice and right.

You can't do it any other way.

Yeah.

In fact, you know, are you going to do it live in front of a studio audience?

We're going to do it live in front of a studio audience as large as we can get.

Maybe like arenas or maybe even stadiums or I don't want to give too much way, but we're going to have you ever seen the Pink Floyd movie Pink Floyd at Pompey at Pompey?

No, I haven't seen that one.

We're going to shoot it at Pompey in front of the old in the old theater.

There in the old surround theater because it's actually the best sound.

Do you think it'll ever go off in the middle of a show?

That would be the dream.

Like suddenly you're doing a show.

Even with a volcano going off again.

Yeah.

Well, we're trying to make that happen because that would be a real cliffhanger moment.

Yeah, it would.

It was hard to get volcanoes to go off, you know?

Yeah, what can you really do?

Like set depth charge explosives or?

Well, there's a lot you can do and we're doing all of it.

It's going to cost a lot of money and boy, I hope people watch boy.

Oh boy, because we'll all die.

Sure, but I mean, we all have to die.

But we'll be frozen in place.

That's the thing.

That's what's beautiful.

You see all these like, you know, statues or skeletons from Pompey?

Man, they're famous.

They're all famous.

You know, everyone who died in Pompey.

Yes, we know.

Because they're eternally in that.

Yeah, in that in that doing.

Yeah.

Can you imagine, okay, everyone, we're acting out the poses.

We're doing like everyone's sort of like reaching to the sky like, hey, lava, don't fall on me.

Can you imagine doing something embarrassing and that be what's like, you're eternally known for like, you're scratching your butt or something like that?

You know, how terrible would that be?

It would be.

But I think a big wall of hot lava is going to make you get your attention away from your S.

I don't know.

I mean, as itchy as it can get, you know, who knows?

I don't know.

Bob, you went through a health scare while you were filming the cowbell cell show.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Is this an Easter egg?

Cowbell cell.

Cowbell cell, more cowbell cell.

Is this an Easter egg in the show where there's a scene where suddenly you clutch your heart and it abruptly cuts away and it made it into the show is like an Easter egg for them?

Yeah, and we're just kind of hoping the audience doesn't notice.

I'm actually dead for about half of it.

I've seen.

Half a scene, really?

I turned gray.

And so the sputtering.

Are they cutting back to your coverage though?

You know, they thought they weren't sure if it was an acting choice.

And then when they saw it, they went, I, we just like it.

They asked me, can we use it?

Can we use it?

And I was like, look, I was on the clock.

I was getting paid.

You're getting paid either way.

When you get a shot.

Sure, if you guys think it's great.

So my character and it does seem a little strange, just shuts down, falls to the ground, turns gray, can't breathe, and they carry on with the scene.

Wow.

And then they're all troopers.

Yeah.

And that showbiz.

That's incredible.

And then after they held cut, a minute or two later.

So a minute or two after they held cut?

Yeah, I was a, I didn't have oxygen for, I don't know, not long.

17, 20, 40 minutes.

Somewhere, yeah, not that big of a brain.

I lost about half my brain, but you know, they say to you, you only use 10% of your brain.

Yeah.

So did you, did you lose the half that wasn't part of that 10?

Or did you?

Yeah, the doctors added an MRI.

And they said, everything you don't use any of the part you lost at all, in fact, we can take it out and they are going to take it.

Oh, they are.

What are they going to do with it?

Well, I don't know.

They're just going to throw it away.

I'd love to have it if you, you know, giving it to me.

I mean, sure, but they're just going to throw it away.

I really don't want to have it.

You know, those metal wastes, yeah, yeah, container.

Trash cans.

You can throw it into that, you know, and so that's coming next week.

And then I'll be lighter, physically lighter.

Yeah.

I have less in my head.

That's great.

And they don't, they replace it with anything.

It's just literally empty and the rest of your brain just flops around in there.

And I guess you can get it.

It's got a little more room, you know?

Yeah, it's not a thing.

It doesn't change anything about who you are.

So if you're like shaking your head in disagreement, you'll hear like a sloshing seal.

Wow, that's amazing.

Congrats, man.

Well, you know, a lot of people get surgery on their faces or whatever.

I want the inside changed.

I want the inside of me different.

That's the thing.

Perfect.

And you've worked hard together that way.

I'm having some of my intestines taken out.

Really?

Which ones?

Long, sure.

Well, I can't decide.

I'm flipping a coin.

I'm trying to decide.

I like them both.

Yeah, they're both great.

I mean, they both do what they do.

But I think I'm going to get rid of the large intestine.

Yeah.

Off to it.

Because I'm just like, well, it's large.

Yeah, I know.

It's like, let's get it.

Let's, let's medium.

Can we, can we agree on a medium intestine for once?

We really need.

Hey, you go, yay.

Dolly, Dolly, Dolly.

I'm going.

Small ones not taking up a lot of room.

No bothering me with a lot of issues.

Ah, sure.

But meanwhile, I get this large one.

I tell you.

So small and medium is going to work for me.

And other things too.

Sure.

Yeah, what about some bones?

You know?

Yeah, I don't think I need all my bones.

You see, your feet have 500 bones.

It's like, come on, let's get this down to 25.

You know what I mean?

Like that's a manageable number.

That's a five-star.

Absolutely.

Yeah.

Yeah, everybody.

You know, the ear.

Relax with the foot bones.

The ear bones too.

They say that's like you have a million in there.

Is that so?

Yeah.

I didn't know that.

The only bone that counts though.

Am I right, buddy?

Morningwood.

That's true.

Be clear.

Let's use the medical term.

Let's just be clear what we're talking about.

Morningwood at this point.

Well better, better.

Gotta get, gotta get that guy.

He's...

Come on, Sal.

Come on, get over here.

He's only on our television screens for another week, another eight days.

Another eight days.

And then you can't see him anywhere.

Never.

No, they're gone for a bit.

They deleted.

I think that's fair too.

For every television show that they make, they should delete one.

That's right.

You know?

Yeah, because otherwise it's too many.

It's too many things.

So like...

It's just a bother.

Like I think now that you guys have made these shows, they should go back and delete the sopranums.

That's right.

Because it's about as...

They're about as good.

You know what I mean?

Right.

They have to be as equally good as well.

Yeah.

And then two years from now, they'll...

Three years from now, they'll get rid of my show and the severance moves into...

Yeah, exactly.

Post-world.

Exactly.

Yeah.

But it's the way TV works and it's the way the business has always been and I think it's good.

Yeah.

What about those movies?

You did that nobody won.

And the main difference to me is the...

There's like 29 frames per second in TV.

You mean between its characters and the story of the two things, the two projects that are possible and...

Yeah, the main difference is...

The main difference is...

Yeah, there's not a story.

It's not the situation.

It's 29 frames per second in the...

In the TV.

In 24 in the movie, is that what...

Yeah.

Yeah, that's the difference.

I mean, essentially, if somebody's watched Better Call Saul, you'd say to them, did you like it?

Did it at a different frame rate?

Yeah.

Then check out nobody.

And if you've seen nobody and they go, what's that Saul show like?

Well, would you like fewer frames?

Do you want more?

I think it's more, isn't it?

I'm not sure.

29.

Who knows?

Are you going to make another one of those movies and call it like somebody or like they're also nobody or like, what are you going to do here?

First of all, thank you for that suggestion.

It's never been uttered before.

Oh, okay.

Bye.

Anyone?

I think we're trying to get one made more.

Nobody as well?

Yes, in fact, that's the title.

Okay.

Nobody as well.

Indeed.

You are though, I mean, you know, you got Jason Manzukas in that other movie, The John Wick 3.

Uh huh.

Yeah.

You know, Izzy.

Yeah.

Oh yeah, yeah.

You should fight him in this new movie.

Jason?

Yeah.

In the film or off stage?

Either one.

During the movie.

During the making of the movie.

Oh, yeah.

I'd like you to fight him.

All right.

I think it's a hand to God.

It's a good idea.

I don't know if I could take him.

He's younger than me.

Spry.

Yeah.

Well, isn't I?

I think I have a little bit.

Slightly younger, slightly spryer.

You mentioned hand to God.

You were saying before the show that you're now incredibly religious and that everything has led to you just basically now having a close personal relationship with.

I wake up every day.

I get baptized in the morning.

I get last rights at night.

Jason case.

Justin case.

How long do those last rights last?

That's the thing they call them.

They last all night.

You can sleep in.

Is it a 24 hour thing though?

Absolutely.

You can't sleep in.

Great.

I have a little altar in my pocket.

I can pull it out and start praying.

Yeah.

Now, but you see, it's what it is.

Scott is now that I've succeeded in my career and I have a certain degree of satisfaction in that department.

Now I care about the purpose and meaning of my existence.

So like a lot of people who get to this place in their lives and their career, all about self empowerment, self awareness, meditation, yogurt.

Yogurt?

Yogurt.

Yes.

All that stuff has come to me now because I'm rich and old.

You can finally afford to fuck around and do nothing.

You can pay people to do all your errands and stuff.

Yeah.

So now I'm suddenly really captivated by that.

It's incredible.

I think it's the most important thing actually now that I've made the money that I need to live.

Yeah.

And so I think I'm a pretty good person and maybe even an extra special person because of my focus now on myself and only the poor people could afford to.

Oh, only, you know, I just look around and I feel so bad and it's just like other people are not as smart as me.

They're not as aware as I am about just existential.

It's a word I just didn't work as hard as you to get where you got as well.

I think I deserve everything I've gotten and probably more, a little bit more.

And now I hope you get that a little bit more.

I think it's really about time I focus on me.

I think I need to meditate and focus on nothingness and myself.

Are you going to climb up any mountains or anything like that?

Do any of those kind of like treks, you know, with a sherpa?

Yeah, I'm going to do some adventures.

I just want to challenge myself as long as you know, I'm really well cared for a whole time.

Exactly.

It's like glamping, in other words.

Yeah.

I'm going to go and slam up on Mount Everest, would you?

Oh, yeah.

Helicopter to the top.

Yes.

Stay in a casino.

I'll bring it up again.

Here it is.

Stay in a casino.

Maybe a tent.

A tent.

But you know, it has a feel like at least two slot machines.

I really back on.

I remember.

It just changed the top of every, you know, have you noticed that?

What do you mean?

Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

Do you remember the mom and pop casino sketch that.

We were all trying to write several, several times.

We should have been able to write.

We should have been able to, but we never could.

But it was all about, I remember the one iteration was about a mom and pop.

It was basically a bed and breakfast casino.

And they had one slot machine.

And it paid out the $5 million jackpot and they couldn't afford it.

And they were like, well, I guess we could borrow a couple thousand from our next door neighbor.

It was just the disintegration of this mom and dad.

That's a great idea.

It was a good idea.

Stu Moore missed show.

Okay.

Let's do it.

Or at least the other show.

What was the other show called with Bob and David?

Is that coming back even after the, as it turns out, I don't think people care that much to see older folks do sketch comedy.

Interesting.

Is it a young men's game or young persons?

I do think it is a young person's game.

I actually think that that's the lesson from that.

Awesome show.

I mean, I think it was a great show.

I'm very proud of it.

It was very funny and silly and perfect.

It's just like who wants to see, you don't want to see old people do that?

You don't want to see these, these.

There's something about it.

The energy for sketch has to be coming from a young face.

Well, it's like when you watch the Irishman and, you know, you're seeing young Robert De Niro's face on this extremely old man's body waddling around and barely able to run.

Right.

That's what it feels like watching with Bob and David, right?

No, we did a great job and it's great.

It's just the audience is not going to go down for it.

Well, I still think that that's my theory.

I have a lot of theories.

You do.

You're one of the people who has the most comedic theories I've ever met.

No, you're not.

I know a lot of people in comedy feel like it's dumb to make theories and rules and I think rules are kind of dumb, but theories are not dumb.

They're good.

They're fun to have.

I mean, I know one guy who had one and his name was an Apple fell on his head and he was suddenly like, hey, maybe there's this thing called gravity and his name was Isaac Newton.

I wanted to say asthma for a long time and someone may have slipped me the answer.

Look, we can agree that I'm not smart, right?

Was I the dumbest writer you ever worked with?

Well, I've worked with myself.

You know, I'm right.

Boy, what a room that was.

Talk about geniuses.

Well, Bob, Brent Forrester went to Columbia and had a perfect SAT.

He was the only person.

He scored a perfect SAT.

The only person who was ever one of the Mr. Show writers who went to college.

Is that right?

No, I graduated from college.

You graduated from college?

Yeah, which one?

Southern Illinois University.

Wonderful.

I'm very happy with myself.

Well, Southern Illinois's best is here with us right now.

Bob Odenkirk, he's saying goodbye to his television.

He's throwing his television away after next week.

After years of, you know, you're just going to rip it out of the wall.

Yeah.

Just throw it right in the dash can.

It's done it.

Me good.

I've done well from it.

Yeah.

You know.

And the fact that you have to have your TV to be on TV and they, it seems inconvenient, but it makes sense when you think about it.

Now, every child knows, you know, you get a box and you cut it out and then you put a show on.

Yeah.

And that's how we do saw.

Exactly.

You have your TV set.

They've, and they've filmed that.

They break out the glass.

It's a fake TV set.

Yeah, it's a fake TV set.

A lot of people don't know.

Yeah.

When you turn on your TV, there's a little even tinier TV in the frame of the TV.

Just barely.

But that's what, that's what we're filming.

Yeah.

Is you guys behind that TV?

Yeah.

Incredible.

It's a great process and totally unnecessary.

But it is worth it.

It's working wonderfully.

It's worth it because the show is so amazing.

Speaking of wonderfulness, we, we, well, we have to take a break if that's okay.

But I know you're done with the interview portion of this show.

What's going on?

There's only so many fake questions we can do before we have to take, go to a break.

Well, we do have to go to a break.

We have a celebrity chef here, Bob.

Oh, this is exciting.

Oh, we also have a lawyer and you played a lawyer on this show, Cal Balsell.

We're going to be right back.

We have more Bob Ode Kirk, more comedy bang bang.

We'll be right back with more after this.

Comedy bang bang, we're back.

Bob Ode Kirk of Cal Balsell is here and there is more Cal Bal in this season.

Oh my God.

This is apparently, it's not more the biggest Cal Bal.

Oh, that's what he meant.

Oh, okay.

So, so the world's biggest.

As we come to the.

World's biggest or United States biggest.

Oh, the world's biggest.

World's biggest.

We pulled out all the stops.

I mean, this thing is it's not a holy graham.

Really?

How big is it like six feet?

Six feet.

You're laughing.

What is it seven?

It's it's the size of an Olympic pool upside down, cowbell size and a cowbell sized Olympic pool upside down.

Such a thing.

I mean, when do you see it on your television set and you'll go like this?

It's probably going to look smaller.

Love for years, cowbell sell played by Bob Odenkirk and then racing on his Kim works.

And you're just going to see like, wow, here comes the biggest cowbell I've ever seen.

They're talking about it and they have emotion and do I have to buy a bigger team in Florida?

What do I dealer is they are going?

I don't want that cowbell in my town.

Ding, ding, ding, ding.

Does he do the ding, ding?

That's what the cowbell is for.

Scott.

Okay.

Spoiler alert, but I love you for it.

You pay attention.

Yes.

I knew it.

I knew if I watched how you know, I knew if I watched this, like every other episode of this show, occasionally.

But it's so satisfying to, to be you and go, hey, I saw the bell.

I remember the bell.

I saw the largest cowbell in the world.

And it's really going to make breaking bad look like like the world's biggest piece of shit, honestly.

Well, not let's put it in bell terms.

Okay.

Like a bell shaped piece of shit?

No, what are you trying to say?

It's going to make breaking bad like a, like a little bell on the ice gate of a, of a 10 year old, you know, figure skater.

Yeah.

Who's taking a shit?

It's going to make it look like a bell on a cat.

Like, put like a cat's neck.

Yeah.

So you know where your cat is.

And this, this goddamn show cowbell salad, I tell you, I think people are going to turn their TVs off and kick them and throw them out the window.

Yeah.

I saw it.

All I need to say, you watch TV.

I saw it.

I already saw that.

I already saw a TV.

I don't need any more.

Wonderful.

Well, thanks for the buildup.

And I think we're going to make people happy.

Yeah, I really do.

We need to get to our next guest though, speaking and making people happy.

Please, I'm sorry.

He is.

Oh, no, not at all.

I love talking to you, of course, but he's a celebrity chef.

Let's talk to him here.

He's never been on the show before.

Bobby Flaz is here.

Hey, it's just so great to be here with you.

Hey, Bobby.

Bob, obviously, you know, huge, huge, huge, two Bobby's.

And I actually think we met a few years of maybe 2012, 13.

I can't remember what was one of my reasons.

I think it was probably a bar of America.

I think you had an after party at Bar of America for signing on what the fuck it was.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

It was so great to see back there.

I love that.

The burgers were great.

We had the slightest stage.

I hope big slightest day everybody, you know, make you with sliders.

You sort of want those fun peaks behind the curry.

Everybody got to go back in the kitchen and pick out different proteins and everything.

Yeah, I don't like that because I'm like, I'm paying you to do it.

Why do I have to make my own thing?

No, it's fun.

It's fun.

You know, you get in there, you get dirty and we actually we try to make it as realistic, you know, a night in the kitchen.

The theme of the party was night in the kitchen.

I don't even remember that.

I do remember.

I remember it very well.

I loved it so much.

So the whole party was like a night in the kitchen.

And you showed up, you had to get there, punch or punch cart.

Yeah, you show up pretty early for you.

They actually had to fill out a form to get a job.

I got W9 in there.

Yeah, I had you shucking oysters for three or four hours.

You're doing prep work?

Yeah, he's doing prep work.

Marion ketchup's.

Marion ketchup's instead of rolly silver and everything.

And yeah, the whole idea behind the whole thing, and we do it with everybody.

You know, a lot of different production, you know, a lot of productions like it.

Yeah, yeah.

Colin, Scarlett, you know, call me over sometimes and we, you know, we'll chop it up with them, you know, do a night in the kitchen for us.

Like the big hit is that I abuse you like I would abuse kitchen staff.

Oh, okay.

So like, and do you normally do that?

I, yeah.

Yeah, you just yell at people.

I don't really know that much about it.

Sometimes I think you meant it.

Sometimes it's made sometimes, you know, it's hard to tell.

I mean, it's like negative reinforcement or whatever.

Some people say it's bad.

I wouldn't even call it abuse.

I would more just call it sort of yelling and occasional violence.

Right.

Okay.

So like, so if I were to be like, what job do I have?

Okay.

So I'm a waiter.

You're a little long.

I don't know that I put you front of house.

Honestly, I think I think I would probably get you started on prawns and, you know, some of the bigger crustaceans.

I don't get to be front of house.

You know, yeah, I don't.

I'm just shook.

Look at you.

I would play because I'm too long.

Yeah, you're too long.

Okay.

All right.

I'll do it.

No, you got to have the body for you.

You got to, but I like to get people who are shaped, you know, like a shrimp or Langoste or something.

I like to put them on the Oh, oh, so shaped like a shrimp.

Yeah, I think you kind of like cold up and you're so long.

I bet you curl up, you know, on a Delta one flight.

I bet you just curl up.

You know what I mean?

Oh, okay.

I guess I know what you mean.

So I'm shocking prawns.

I do know what you're talking about.

I remember now the night that I was there.

Yeah, you were there.

Everybody was sort of sorted by body type.

Sort of my body type and what the animal they look the most like tend to be.

You know, how you know, so say I'm shucking these prawns and then I make a mistake.

Is that when you would yell at me?

Oh, your piece of shit.

Are you ugly?

You're ugly.

You're family is the wrong religion.

Again, half of it is true and half of it is true.

Which part is true?

You're feeding it too big.

It's true.

One foot is bigger than the other.

That's weird.

That's bad.

Yeah.

My family being the wrong way.

How can you ascertain what's the right religion?

You know, yeah, you look at somebody.

You guys should be Catholic.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

You mean it depends on each person.

You don't know the right way.

Well, I mean, the insult would be different.

I mean, those are just the insult for you.

I can insult Bob, you know, completely different.

Yeah, yeah.

Do it to Bob, if you don't.

I remember I was slow.

You were slow.

I was not sure what I was doing.

What was your job?

What was your body type?

What animal do you look like?

Well, I have a kind of a long torso.

Ox tails.

He put me right on ox tails and you can see I could.

This doesn't seem efficient to have one person just doing one ingredient.

Well, it's a really good degree.

I mean, that's a chef cut.

Okay.

So a bad butcher would throw that away.

I was a chef.

I look at the ox tail goes.

Right.

I don't mean to get into your business.

But so what were you saying to Bob here?

So I was working with the ox tails and I had to.

It was like a Caribbean thing.

We were sort of doing like a Caribbean slice.

Like a jerk.

Kind of like an.

I had to put the jerk flavoring on them, you know, spices and the oils and I had to marinate them.

I had to double check constantly checking the time.

We were there like nine hours while we were marrying.

I had to put him in the oven off the oven in the fridge.

Yeah.

Off the.

I mean, it was.

There's a lot of work that you were doing.

You were doing it.

Let me take the ox tails home.

He said, take them home.

You had to come back the next day with them?

No, no, no, same day.

Get in the car.

Take them home.

Put them in the front room.

You know, whatever, get an air and do an air.

Yeah.

Do you have a rumpus room?

You have like some kind of bonus room somewhere you keep all your collectibles.

You stupid.

Because I have TV.

Action figures and then.

And then I will call you.

He said, and then be back here.

Yeah.

Fast.

I need to back here.

Yeah.

And so he wasn't doing this right.

And so how would you.

He was a little say, say, say you're cutting traffic and I said, you're cooking with Bobby Flay.

What do you mean traffic?

You get out of the car.

You walk.

Yeah.

Or take an ambulance.

Take an ambulance.

Take rent an ambulance.

If you're going to be working with him.

He's got a full treatment and I loved it.

I yelled at.

I got kicked.

I got thrown.

Everybody there.

They thought it was so.

Wow.

The grease pit.

What about the grease pit?

Tell them about the grease pit.

Well, you know, the grease pit, it's not really so much a grease pit as sort of like, it's like a speakeasy kind of thing.

Oh, okay.

It's called the grease pit.

Yeah.

So it was why you go like the floor was very.

There's a door.

There's exceptionally sticky.

So it's a room in the we could never get that floor cleaned well enough.

Oh, okay.

But I turned into kind of a speakeasy just sort of like hang out with some of the celebrities that we would have there for some of those parties.

You know, Bob was this.

Jake from State Farm.

Wow.

So we had Jared from Sublane.

Jared from Sublane.

So it was a pretty fun little party.

And you get the right people.

Right group of people.

You know, a chef wants to bring together the right group of people.

Yeah.

He wants to make magic with a bunch of family agreements.

So if it's a Bobby play party, if it's the night at the kitchen, you know, I want to find the right people.

Yeah.

Wow.

So I got to ask though, at what point?

I can wrap a port, you know.

Oh, wow.

Carson from Queer Eye.

Carson from Down Abbey.

Oh, really?

Carson from Down.

Mr.

Carson, so at what point do people get to actually enjoy the party and the food that they are all having?

Well, it's the slightest style night.

I mean, it's sliders.

I mean, everybody looks like in the end, it's just sliders.

Just sliders.

You do all this.

You do all this prep work for the next night?

You use the food then in your restaurants or because we just had sliders.

If I remember, there was a lot of prep.

That was the fun part.

Everybody's doing prep.

Dojo-Cats day.

All day, all morning, all afternoon.

And then here comes the sliders and then go in the room and make your sliders.

And then- Well, I try to stagger out the popular proteins.

You know what I mean?

I mean, I wanted the Oxtails.

Like the whole thing with you going home coming back, I mean, part of that's the abuse.

Part of that is like, it's 3 a.m.

We're partying.

Shondan.

Shondan's there.

Shondan.

Yeah.

I remember when Adrian Brody introduced him on SNL.

Yeah.

I mean, that was pretty crazy.

I don't think he's allowed back to having those.

It's pretty nice.

I mean, I wouldn't know.

I don't work there.

I hang out with Colin Scarlott.

You hang out with Colin Scarlott.

Yeah, hang out with- Scarl Joe, is that what people call her?

Darryl.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

You're red.

Wally from Cucards.

Wally from Cucards?

Yeah.

At these parties, this is amazing.

So you just throw the food away or what do you do?

No, no, no, no.

That's the theme of the night.

The theme of the night is what the people would throw away, but a chef likes it.

Okay.

So you're going to have to eat sliders.

You're going to have to eat sliders.

Toe-foo has shown us his cut of Episode 1.

Oh, yeah.

This thing.

Yeah, wow.

I've heard of it.

So we actually cook in Toydarian.

That's what Wado is.

I don't know.

Wado from Episode 1, he's...

It's on Tatooine.

He's a pretty big character.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

He's kind of like a Jewish monster.

Like monster.

And he's a made exterior type.

Yeah.

And the Armenian stereotype.

Yeah, yeah.

And that's what you made the meet out of it.

He's a Toydarian.

And so we actually secured some Toydarian primal.

I'm going to get Toydarian.

We got Toydarian primal.

Yeah.

Celebrity chef.

I know how to get meat.

This is amazing.

Yeah, so it was a really special night.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, I guess so.

I mean, so what do you have to do now, Bobby?

I mean, like, do you have a new book or do you have a new show coming out?

And I would love to throw it to it.

Throw it to the show right now.

Oh, throw it to...

Oh, meaning we're going to play some of the show?

Okay.

Yeah.

Can we do that?

Do we?

I've never done clips on it.

And so what I do is we just talk in this way, talking this way.

Yeah.

Okay.

We're shooting Bobby, B-Bobby Flay.

B-Bobby Flay, is that what the show is called?

I could do another show called B-Bobby Flay.

It's actually probably a pretty good...

I'll tell my assistant about that later.

Okay.

So B-Bobby Flay, you know...

Beats Bobby Flay.

Sorry, it's the East Coast vowel choices and the consonant.

You know what?

You know, I'm sorry, but I'm trying to...

It would last 20 minutes in my kitchen.

Okay, so Beats Bobby Flay.

If we shoot and beat Bobby Flay, then they'll cut to me and I got to explain, you know, for the Food Network, because you know who watches Food Network, he's the idiots.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, I guess what you have.

You have many shows there, though.

If I start a red sauce, you know, I'm going to have to do a cutaway and explain what the hell a red sauce is.

What is a red sauce?

I guess I don't even know.

It's like a sauce that's red.

It's got tomatoes.

It's a tomato-based sauce.

Tomato-based sauce.

I'm so sorry.

It's okay.

I apologize to you.

I mean, trying your best, Bobby, and I just think you reach out and over and over again to everyone.

But people just don't know food.

They just let you down.

I mean, I suddenly felt very intimidated by you that I didn't know what a red sauce was.

I assume it was.

Yeah.

A lot.

Well, sure.

All the time.

No, I got cats.

I got a dole-daughter.

Cats, a dole-daughter.

Southwest flavors.

Yeah.

East Coast attitude.

West Coast guy.

Yeah.

You know?

So I, there's elements of my life that I really enjoy.

And then they stuff that, I mean, Bob, people don't change.

Rough stuff.

Yeah.

People change, but people don't change.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well, we try to get real on the show.

And thank you, Bob, for asking the real questions.

I'm going to throw to a show.

He's excited about the food.

Yeah.

And I love that.

That's great.

But I can tell it's just covering up for real, a real emptiness.

You can really see the sadness behind your eyes.

I mean, you know, this kind of feeling is great for like a cutaway, if I have to explain what a gravy is or whatever.

Yeah.

But you really got to turn it up if you're throwing to another package on Food Network.

What is a gravy?

I mean, I've had gravy, but what?

What?

It's, you know, it's like what?

It's fats suspended in a liquid.

Because they're flour?

It's like an emulsion.

It's thicket in emulsion typically involves some sort of slurry.

Yeah.

I mean, I would know it if I ate it, but I wouldn't know how to make it.

Maybe go to a restaurant, say I would like some emulsion with some slurry on top of my meat.

Yeah.

See what that gets you.

And they'll probably...

If you're in one of Bobby's restaurants, you'll get some grapes.

You'll get grapes.

You go somewhere else.

I can't buy it.

Well, that's great.

So beat Bobby Flays, the show.

Beat Bobby Flays, the show.

And I got to explain this to stuff that when we do in the cutaways, you know, the talking head product, I hate that part.

That's not what I'm about.

Right.

I'm a Q card and I want a big jib shot and I want to scream my head off into that camera as it pulls away over the crowd.

Right.

So give us an example of this.

Oh, that would be like, you know, that's it.

Now, stay tuned for my epic Thanksgiving donkey punching bag fest for fat losers and drunk moms in partnership with ISAIA's 28 Death Decafemen.

Let's kill all the humans so that we can stay alive from anymore.

Films of this franchise.

That was perfect.

I mean, yeah, that's what you want out of a Bobby Flays.

That's really what the job's about.

Yeah.

Food is my passion.

But doing these throws, the throws are sort of the job.

You know, that's the thing.

That's what you get paid for.

Right.

I get paid to cook.

I mean, I don't get paid.

You would cook for free, but these throws, I think most people don't pay attention when you're cooking.

It's the throws that they watch.

They sit up.

Most of the audience is there for be Bobby Flays.

They're for the throws.

They want to see throws.

Right.

Yeah.

Do you have any more?

I mean, you know, I could do something like, and it's just like on the top of my head.

Okay.

Yeah.

Some like, that's it.

Now, stay tuned for my epic Miami Beach party boat, big down for shrimp dicks and smoking hot Christians brought to you by return of the crew.

Let's see it all the dinosaurs because the crews ran out of salad and it's dino-chomping time.

Wow.

Off the dome.

That is incredible.

I mean, you know, we do a lot of cross-formational stuff with the kids stuff.

Yeah.

There's a lot of parents that watch, you know, parents that watch Magnolia Network, the TLC family and networks.

Yeah.

That was great.

That's exciting to hear that.

And I want to watch this.

I mean, I would have spread the word.

I love spread the word about food.

I love spread the word about the fruits and the fish.

The show's called Bobby Flay.

I mean, I've that's been on for years.

Is there anything new, a new show or?

I mean, you know, we were talking with.

What about the show that just throws?

Just throws.

Let me throw.

Throw Bobby Flay.

Throw.

Yeah.

Throw Bobby Flay from the train.

Yes.

Yeah, we could do that.

And it's in the mamaverse.

What does the train have to do with it?

Throw mama from the train.

Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, the twisted mind of Danny DeVito.

Come on, put it in the mamaverse.

Danny's a good friend.

I had all the sunny crew.

You know, we were chopping it up a couple weeks ago.

I had a big like make your own salads line.

That was fun.

Everything make your own.

Are you going to feel a lot of people?

I mean, the catering, the quality could go south so fresh.

So you got to bring the people in.

The pain.

Never mind.

Well, do you have any more throws?

Because you're right, Bob.

I would I would watch just throws.

Just throws.

More.

Can you do anything else here or?

I mean, yeah, I mean, there's, you know, I was thinking about one that was like kind of like, you know, one I was thinking about.

I mean, if you want to hear it.

Yeah.

Don't be bashful here.

Yeah, I'd love to hear.

All right.

So some like, yeah, that's it.

Now, stay tuned for my epic in Sonata and Chilada, Eligonza for rude boys, gassy queens and adjunct statistics professors featuring a clumsily integrated co-marketing strategy with Luca, the movie that's not Pixar, but still Disney about the boy who became a monster and made a friend in the evil world that caused certain issues in the regular world rated NC 17.

I didn't realize it was rated that.

That's amazing.

Yeah.

I would watch the show, Bob.

Thank you.

Absolutely.

We wanted to attach as executive producers, but do that and go to commercial.

Do you want to come to commercial?

Yeah, go to commercial.

Yeah.

I mean, you might be interested in this one.

Talking about something that incorporating that whole thing, the kids animation thing.

How do we get the kids hooked in and cooking?

So this was a new show I'm thinking about how to cook a minion.

Oh, I love that.

Yeah, basically we talk about- B minions are cute.

Yeah, we talk about sort of, I mean, that's a barrier definitely, but how to break one down, break a minion down in 20 minutes.

Right.

Do it come dead or do you have to- Oh, do you have to kill the minion before you break it down?

Yeah, I'm all-fee Vegas.

My restaurant, I'm all-fee.

We get the full minion.

The full minion.

We get about five a week.

Are the eyes?

Like, do those taste good?

I mean, I find the eyes to be a little rubbery.

Sometimes they only have one.

Sometimes they only- Yeah, that's the other thing is it's pretty inconsistent.

You actually wish minion you're going to get.

That's going to affect cook times.

It's going to affect, you know, the size of the skillet.

Are they all wearing blue shorts or- Or you get them completely nude.

Before you break it down?

Yeah.

Wait, before you kill the minion, do you get it nude?

Does it take a long time to cook?

Do you kill it and then strip it?

I mean, if we do- We have a lot of questions here.

If we're doing like a big like Sunday night dinner, like Filipino style whole minion.

Yeah, we have to make our own minion.

Not anything.

So like, I mean, yeah, I mean, once we get, you know, sort of whole hog, if you do like a whole hog- Sure, yeah.

A Filipino barbecue kind of thing.

We do that with a whole minion and yeah, you might have to get in there with, I don't know, bonsai, some she is.

Hmm.

Yeah.

Grissom tastes good.

Tastes really good.

I've never had many.

I think it's delicious.

They're funny and it's funny how great they taste.

Yeah.

Do they make it noise as they go down?

Do they say it tastes like banana?

I mean, they're kind of squeaky like a Herricka vera that's not, you know, totally cooked.

You know, they kind of squeaky against you.

Almonds, you know, almonds kind of squeaky.

Yeah.

Almonds are squeaky.

They eat a lot of raw, they kind of squeak against you.

Yeah, they squeak.

I guess I've never done so.

I think a minion, I've had a couple minion dinners.

They're a little like shark.

Yeah, it's fatty.

It's deadly fatty.

Yeah.

They look fat to me like they don't look muscular.

There's a lot of fat.

There's a lot of fat, but they seem almost all fat.

Yeah.

To me, like they have no muscle definition.

What's the marinade?

I mean, obviously, East Coast guy, Salas Flavus, I'm going to go with something that's a little bit more like that lime cilantro, red onion, sort of ceviche direction.

Yeah.

Is that every single dish you put out tastes just like that?

No, I mean, sometimes I'll do a mole.

Do mole do.

I'm sorry.

Sometimes you do a mole.

Sort of like a remesco.

Remesco.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

Roast red peppers, Spanish style sauce.

Well, this is great.

Look, Bobby, we're coming up on another break.

Sate.

Is it another throw that you could do?

Or are we going to the well once too often?

I mean, I think people are probably tired of it by the way.

No, I'm not.

I think people want to see it.

Throw us to commercial.

Yeah.

Show.

Yeah.

I mean, you know, probably be some, some like, oh, you know what, this would be fun to do.

Okay.

This is great.

So like say that you and I were on B-Bobby Flay together.

Okay.

And obviously I beat you at your signature dish.

What's your signature dish?

Tacos maybe.

You know, just tacos.

Just Coast guy Southwest flavors.

Just tacos.

Scotch and mint tacos.

Well, I don't, I mean, you know, you make the meat and you put cheese on.

What meat?

I mean, tell me what are these tacos.

It's like beef or chicken or something.

Ground beef.

Bob help me out.

What's your signature dish?

Oh, tuna salad.

Tuna salad.

Yeah.

Tuna salad better than tacos.

Tuna melts.

Battle tuna melts.

Yeah.

All right.

Well, it would be something like this.

Like if I just beat you, you know, the gyps flying away.

We got a camera's flying.

Yeah.

I'll probably like look up at the camera and be like, well, it was, well, to tonight was tuna me.

I melted tonight.

You can sit it.

Consider tonight melted.

I melted the competition.

And then it would be tied into a move tied into some sort of new child's child's film.

Yeah.

You know, like a go see Sesame Street live.

Yeah, that kind of yeah.

So yeah, I don't know.

Turning red or turning rent.

Why didn't I get a fucking call about turning red?

I don't know.

I mean, I want to be in the period move.

Why can't I be in the period move?

It's not.

Well, I mean, it is about a young woman growing up, but that's it's not like, of course, it's, um, Mary turns into a, I mean, it's a metaphor for getting your period.

Yes, you're right.

I thought it was a period movie like a like a period nightly and shit like little women starring Bob Odenkirk.

Yeah.

Yeah, you were great in that, by the way, gets rounds of applause when he enters the scene.

Thank you.

You and you and Barbie exhaust.

No, you're not doing Barbie.

I wish I was.

I would like to tell the story of the doll and how it came.

Bob, you ever see that?

You ever see that, uh, video of your entrance in little women and they put the audience, uh, from a Benjors Endgame clapping onto it?

No, I haven't seen that.

It's very funny.

Uh, well, throw it.

So was that your throat?

Yeah, I'll throw it.

I'll throw it away.

Yeah, throw it.

Here we go.

That's it.

Now stay tuned for more of my, of my kitchen stadium with comedy bang bang here in beautiful sunset, area boulevard.

That's it.

All right.

That is it.

All right.

We need to take a break.

Boy, when we come back, we have a lawyer.

Bobby, can you stick around?

I'd love to have you.

Yeah, I'll stick around and I actually got a, I think I brought a hot plate.

Oh, oh, wow.

You guys were interested in competing against you or in just, you know, like, I'm just thinking like a bananas, foster something like that.

I don't know.

I was gonna see what he had in the break room.

I was gonna see what you had in the break room.

Probably just chips, but yeah, if you have anything.

Minion.

Yeah.

I couldn't get you a minion.

I could, I could try.

I could make you close.

Well, we're going to be right back.

We'll have more Bobby Flay, more Bobby Odenkirk.

This is a battle of the bobs right here.

You can use that in one of your throws.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang we're back Bob Odenkirk of cowbell salb, blah, blah, blah, he's here.

Two more apps and then he disappears.

That's enough.

That's enough for that.

Then you just, do you fade away like in back to the future?

Like Marty McFly on that picture or do you like float up to heaven?

Like Jesus did after he hung around after he came back to life or what do you do?

I just, I actually will, my image will burn onto the screen.

Whatever screen is has it on.

Really?

That will be there forever.

So if you watch the final moments, it's new technologies.

One that's just seared into the screen.

And it'll, you'll smell something burning.

Oh, okay.

Like a cow being branded almost or?

Yeah, I don't know if it's a meaty smell.

It'll smell like oil burning.

Oh, okay.

It's your TV set.

It'll be ruined.

Oh God.

Okay.

And that's, you know, I mean new technology.

You'll see my face then forever as the character.

If you're watching the prices right or wave in my finger.

And like to Kim Bae.

Gotcha.

You know what?

We have to teach you who to Kim Bae Mutombo is by the end of this episode.

I mean, I know his name.

I didn't know his name.

Of course, you know his name.

Finger wagging thing.

Yeah.

You got, well, they're all sending you a meme or two.

We also have Bobby Flay here.

I have a party with Dick Bae Mutombo recently.

He's a great guy.

Yeah, really.

It was a crazy party.

Wow.

Crazy party.

Yeah.

Great crew.

What a crew.

Yeah, that was like a py a big py a night.

A py a night.

Make your own py a silk a rod and yeah.

Okay.

Well, we have to get to our next guest.

He's a lawyer.

He's been on the show several times.

And it's very exciting to have him here, especially with a fake lawyer right here.

But please welcome back to the show with Taliano Jones.

Scott, what's the matter?

What's wrong?

I came as quick as I could.

Have you been injured?

No, no, I have a fight for you.

Scott, what is wrong?

Let me touch you.

No, but I feel like you're going to injure me.

Do you have injuries?

No, I've been lifting weights.

Am I strong?

You're incredibly strong.

Give me your own.

Yeah, here's that.

Yeah, I heard.

God, yes.

Taliano.

Yes, I have been lifting weights.

You're the one who's hurting me.

Hi, this is Bob Odenkirk.

Hello, Bob Odenkirk.

It's great to meet you.

Bobby Flay.

Hello, Bobby Flay.

Hey, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you, Taliano.

I have two Bobs here.

But Taliano is a, you're a personal injury lawyer.

I'm a personal injury lawyer and attorney at law.

And I appreciate if anybody has ever injured personally that you please call me and let me know which has injured you and I will fight for you.

Where do people call you?

Did you even do illegal cases or did you just fight?

Legal and illegal cases.

I fight for everybody.

Nobody is discriminated against in my court of law.

Bobby, have you ever had a lawsuit against you?

I mean, I have thought periodically about suing this ratty ass Suvide machine that I had.

Please, a Suvide machine.

What happened?

Tell me more.

Does the water not get hot?

Burn the hell out of my thumb.

Oh, the water gets too hot.

What are you making when you're Suvide in the state?

I was, Suvide is this is like herb chicken kind of thing.

You put a herb chicken in the Suvide.

I've never heard of such a thing.

Well, it's going into some enchiladas.

It's Southwest flavor.

Yeah.

Southwest flavor.

What's the flavor with the West Coast instinct?

Let me ask you this, Bobby Flay.

Yeah, sure.

Bobby Flay, I am looking to do you make Italian food?

Well, yeah.

I love Italian food.

I love mostly Tuscany.

Tuscany game meets you.

Or I do a boar.

Ah, boar.

We did a boar at a bar American for many years.

Ah, a bar American.

That's it, Lynn.

Hey, you know, I wanted to tell you about my TV show, Scott.

Oh, you have a TV show?

You have a TV show.

Because both of these, I mean, Bob, unfortunately, is not going to have a TV show anymore.

Oh, Bob, you had a TV show?

Well, I did.

It's going away very soon.

Yeah.

Oh.

This is going to be the worst time of your life not having a TV show.

I don't know who I'll be.

I don't know what I'll do.

I tell you.

But yeah.

You could be on my TV show.

Yeah, what's your TV show?

Better call Italy.

It's the case where somebody is trying to find a calling card to call Italy.

Just like a phone card, a prepaid phone card?

Yes.

And they are going a bunch of places, but the code that they scratch off the back never works.

It sounds like a bad dream actually that you had.

So is people walking around Target?

People walking around Target.

People walking around Walmart.

People walking around Escal in London.

I mean, this sounds like a bad dream you had one night, not an actual TV show.

It came to me in the dream.

Yeah.

I was dreaming about attorney in that law.

And then this popped up.

And I said, what would happen if I was stuck in a place like this, for example, located right here on Sunday sunset in the sunset area and I'm sorry, in the sunset Boulevard area.

And I was wondering, what if I got stuck here and I could not call my mom back in Italy?

Yeah.

How's she doing, by the way?

What was her name?

She's very bad.

What are you doing here?

I came for you, Scott.

I love you just as much as I love my mother.

All I did was text you, do you want to be on the show?

And I said, that's a sign of distress.

That is a fake text.

I need to go.

Okay.

Well, you're here now.

There's nothing wrong with me.

I just wanted to have you on the show to talk to you.

I haven't talked to you in a while.

I guess I can breathe again.

Yeah.

Well, I mean, have you had any interesting cases?

Oh my God.

I've had so many interesting cases, Scott.

As you know, as you have felt, give me your arm.

Okay.

Now you're doing it again.

I'm very strong.

I'm not the tallest and strongest man in Italy.

Yes.

Oh, that's right.

You're the tallest man in Italy.

How tall are you?

Six for five.

There are short people there.

I was just there.

I looked around for anyone above six five.

No one didn't see them because I was here looking for you.

Now the most recent case I have had, and this one is very in depth.

Okay.

Yeah.

Ready.

Yes.

Somebody walked into a building and they walked into the building and the glass from the building, they didn't open the door and they walked right into the glass.

Through the glass?

Yes, it broke.

It broke completely.

Oh, no.

Cutting them to shreds.

Yes.

So they lie in shreds?

They lie in shreds and I had to put them back together in the court of law.

What?

Right in the middle of the court, I had to put them back together.

It was so much glue and Italy and glue does not stick well.

Really?

Italian glue is really it's really bad.

It's just marinara's stuff.

It's delicious.

Is that a red sauce?

It doesn't work.

Yeah.

I've had Italian glue before.

Some people call it gravy.

Some people call it red sauce, but Italy, they call it glue.

I learned that last time.

Interesting.

Yeah.

Wow.

The things you know when you're a celebrity chef, yeah.

Opus a lot of doors.

Yeah, I bet.

I would love to come to one of your parties.

Yeah.

I could, you know, I could have you at a party.

I don't know.

Like it kind of people that, I mean, who do you like?

Who do you party with?

All the Italian celebrities.

Yeah.

Like who do we got there?

We met you.

Yeah.

Okay, Joni.

The roaches.

The roaches?

Yeah.

I mean, I feel like you're describing more like a little, little canyon kind of like Jayce Taylor.

Hime.

You know that kind of thing.

Yes.

The roaches and Hime.

They are older and younger version of each other like an M9 Shyamalan movie.

That's right.

Yeah.

I party with Hime.

You party with Hime?

Yeah, I party with Hime.

Danny Masterson.

You're a party with him.

Nah.

You know, I used to do a Scientology, Scientology parties.

I mean, those people love the high ages of cover band.

They play get lucky all night.

You know, like guys, it's fun to pretend to be on the boat and everything.

I'd rather be on a real boat.

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

We have Scientology in Italy.

You do.

It is called Discovery Zone or DZ for short.

The children go there to play.

I didn't know that.

Is that a real fact?

Everything I say is a real fact.

I know.

I have to, I swear on the stack of Bibles.

Well, look, this is a little loose is light.

Yes.

If I lie.

Speaking of which, Bob, you know your stuff when it comes to lawyers.

Well, I didn't see any lawyers.

This is a real lawyer.

Yeah, but I mean, I was playing a lawyer and if you were to watch my show, you'd probably laugh and see.

I would love to see though.

That's not how it is.

I would like to see you guys compete against each other for a case or something.

Like say, Bobby, you have a case, right?

You mean me and character?

Yes, exactly.

Yeah.

Well, yeah.

Calwell Sal, he was on the show once before.

I don't know if you remember, but he came on.

Do you remember that?

Yeah, vaguely.

I do.

Cool.

So, I mean, you and character would be you.

You don't have all of the show's catalog.

But every week I do try to listen to every episode of the show.

You edit the wiki though.

A lot of people don't know that.

Bob is in charge of the comedy.

I like it right.

But yeah, so you said, say you had a case.

I got a case.

Maybe Calwell Sal and Jesse cooked the wrong.

I'll eat for myself in character.

Yeah.

So you and Jesse and you made Badmash and then I'm there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And you know, it's like you definitely do it.

Something I mean, I probably would start off.

If I'm looking at it, I'd probably start off thinking like in a chili reino direction, right?

Yeah, sure.

Yeah, of course.

So, you know, say it's the case of the chili reino and then.

And Jesse and Walter are helping you and Cunk, Don Draper, everybody's just sort of, you know, they, they.

Who got big pussy?

Big pussy's here.

And you know, it's chili reinos.

I mean, it's like the breading definitely, you know, like it, maybe a little soda water or something like that.

You keep it light, freshly outside.

That inside gets really hot.

Sure.

And when you, what's the case though, what are you just just spreading right into it?

Oh, okay.

He burns his mouth and they want to sue me.

It was sue me.

Yeah.

Right.

I already defend you.

And I'm keeping quiet because I'm not supposed to talk during this portion of the trial.

I told him, don't say a thing.

Shut your mouth.

You have been injured eating a very hot chili reino.

Bonjour.

Ladies and gentlemen of the court.

I am from Italy.

Bonjour.

I need everybody to know that my client here has a hot mouth and a big pussy.

Can I represent Mr. Flay, who's an expert chef and he can do a throw like no one's business.

And that's it.

Now stick.

Oh, you could show the court your throw.

If it pleased the court, if it pleased your honor.

I mean, everybody wants to see it.

I mean, everybody wants to see me.

If everyone's pleased, I'd like to, I'd like him to show us something.

He told me not to talk.

Show us a throw.

Please me.

All right.

I'll stay told for the rest of this hearing brought to you by turning red.

That was so loud.

I have an issue.

I have an issue, judge.

Who is the judge?

Here come the judge.

Oh, Joe Gito is here.

Oh, wait.

No, no, no, no, no, no.

He wasn't pronounce it.

Leto.

Judge Leto.

Oh, oh, it's Jared Leto doing role doing research for a role.

Oh my God.

This is incredible.

Hey, I'll allow it.

First of all, just Jared Leto.

Why are you in yellow face?

Because I just washed off my Joker makeup and this was what was underneath.

Understood.

Judge Bonjour, first of all, I'm from Italy.

My name is Italiano Jones.

I'm the tallest lawyer in Italy and the tallest man and strongest man.

Throw me something.

Throw something off the court.

Here you go.

Ah, see, I caught it.

Now, my...

It's just a bean bag.

But most weak people cannot catch things.

Listen here, Judge.

My client, Big Pussy, has burned his mouth on this man's chili, really, you know.

And I think he was trying to kill him.

Is this true?

No, I'm not even trying to kill him.

On behalf of Mr. Flay, I'm his lawyer.

Who are you, sir?

I'm cowbell Sal.

Cowbell Sal, I've heard about you.

Yeah.

Have you seen my commercials?

The Big Cowbell.

The world's been out.

Ring a ding ding.

I'm in your corner.

I have seen those.

It's an honor to preside in front of you.

All right.

I'm the lawyer.

You're the judge.

I know, but all right.

If you want to be honored by my president, something...

I'm usually, they call me your honor.

Listen, but I'm the one who's honored now.

When a chef like Mr. Flay makes his food, he's got other things on his mind.

He's got throws coming up.

He's got other food coming up.

There's multiple courses.

Shelley Bralano, The Dessert, different gravies.

Sing three.

Is there going to be a sing three?

Sing three.

I knew there was a sing two.

His job is to serve the food as hot as can be so that as time goes by, it remains warm so they can be eaten for the next few minutes or even up to an hour or two.

Right?

Isn't that what you say?

Yeah.

I mean, I wouldn't eat my chili raday and I have to two hours.

It's not really.

Yeah, but in an hour of $50.

I mean, you know, when you fry, it does lose a lot pretty quickly.

You should shut up.

I told you before you shouldn't talk to me.

Open it that case.

No, shut.

Let's shut this.

Let's reopen the cage.

Shelley, right now.

I'm opening the cage.

I'm reopening the case.

What's it's honored to be judge?

Oh, yeah, they get really hot.

They stay hot for a long time.

Judge Lito.

Lito.

If you don't mind, I'd pronounce your name properly.

It's not her to be in front of you.

Judge Lito.

Mr. Flay made the food as hot as he could.

When you enter his restaurant, there is a sign.

It says no shoes, no shirt, no service.

Food served hot.

Really?

Piping hot.

It's written in a restaurant that my this big pussy fellow went to is called Pipers.

Pipers hot restaurant.

Is this true?

It's Helliono, Joe.

It is one of many, many restaurants.

I don't know how many clues he needed to be given that the food would be served hot.

There are signs everywhere.

There is the fume symbol of heat rising from an item.

It's a cartoon symbol of is it like one of those ones you see at the airport where there's like fireworks and and that is everywhere.

Mr. Flay.

Couldn't be construed though.

Hellbelle Sal as stink lines like no one no one can be sued for being construed.

Oh my gosh.

Everybody said case.

Why do you keep saying that?

You're supposed to be representing this man.

My client thought the food was farting.

Oh, yes.

They were stink lines.

We thought they were stink lines and we thought the name Piper's came from the location.

It was in Piper's alley in Chicago and that's what we thought that was going on.

It's just one location among many.

It's just by pure coincidence that it was in Piper's alley.

Can we sidebar with me with the lawyers?

Yes, all of us.

Bobbie get over here.

No, don't talk.

Yeah, I'll settle here.

No throws.

I wasn't planning on playing.

No throws.

What do you have to say, Judge?

What do you have to say?

This guy Bobby Flay.

Yes.

He's obviously an East Coast guy with South Coast flavors.

I'll tell you that.

East Coast guy.

Southwest flavors.

West Coast attitude.

Sorry.

He's obviously an East Coast guy.

Southwest flavors.

West Coast attitude.

Sorry, did you say salad bar?

Salad bar attitude.

Is this a sidebar or a salad bar?

Sorry, this is a side bar.

Do me a favor, Bobby.

Zip it.

I thought he said salad bar.

I came over here.

Did you bring any salad bar?

Nice cucumbers.

I had some romaine hearts.

Zip it and keep it quiet.

Open this at case.

Look, what are we doing, guys?

What is your...

This guy obviously doesn't have a case.

Who?

Big pussy?

Neither of them.

You know what I mean?

Okay, we're not suing anyone.

We were sued and that's why we're here.

Well, you don't have a case.

He doesn't have a case.

We don't want a case.

What are we doing here?

We don't want a case.

Let's go back to my place and party is what I'm trying to say.

Would it be okay?

Hold on a second.

If would you make your own sliders?

That's why I have to ask Mr. Flay because he does the only kind of party he does.

I do a lot of party.

Would you do the prep work?

Can we watch Suicide Squad at the party?

You have to ask Mr. Flay.

Count me out.

Okay.

Then I rule in favor of Bobby Flay.

Wow, because I don't want to watch that movie.

I don't watch something else.

I love House of Gucci.

Oh, the Gucci.

You like House of Gucci.

I love House of Gucci.

It reminds me of home.

Especially you and Lady Gaga.

Okay, well, I rule in favor of you then.

Okay.

I'm taking back my ruling.

I'm ruling in favor of because he.

Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

We're going to have to take the hit on this one.

You'll have to do a few more throws and you'll make the money in no time and who cares.

That's it for the case of the Chile Reino Bobby Flay loss.

Now stay till for Suicide Squad.

Starring Harley Quinn and the boy with the words written on his forehead rated PG-13.

Amazing.

Wow.

See, Italiano, you did you I mean you won the case.

Thank you so much.

I told you I'm the best I'm the best lawyer.

There's a crazy thing he wanted by being agreeable.

Yeah, by just saying he liked House of Gucci.

Which no one likes House of Gucci.

Did you actually, were you lying or?

I love House of Gucci.

It reminds me of home.

It's just like Mama used to make.

Wow.

Incredible.

Well, guys, this is, I mean.

My mom made films.

Oh, you're oh, I thought you meant the food or the clothes.

My mom made my mom made.

What did she do?

Just like Mama used to make.

My mom is Martin Scorsese's mom as well.

What?

She's even good fellas.

Yeah.

Well, guys, look, we're running out of time.

It's totally on.

It's great to have you here.

Thank you for having me.

But we only have one time for one final feature on the show.

And that is, of course, a little something called plugs.

I love my mommy and I love my dad.

And I sure hope that they will be too mad.

Cause I made this thing keep moving right in my pants.

And since I'm 30 and not a baby, it's extremely sad.

And I hope there's baby wipes inside a deep plug bag.

Oh, well, that was charming.

That was Baby Made a Boom Boom by Ferg Burger.

Thank you so much to Ferg Burger for that wonderful plugs theme submission.

What'd you think of that Bob?

People have a lot of frees on Bob.

What do you want to plug?

Obviously you have some.

Oh, you're booked too.

Want to talk about?

Oh, yeah.

Let's talk about my memoir comedy, comedy, comedy drama.

If you want to hear all about the obscure comedy of the last 30 years, I can tell you about some of it.

That's fine.

I've heard it's very good.

I know.

I wish I brought a copy for you.

I wish you had to.

I mean, for the book release, we did the party and the courses were done in the same way, comic, comic, comic, drama.

Also, it was funny food for free courses.

Yeah, it was funny food.

The grapes from when you go to a haunted house, somebody's haunted house, you know, the grapes that Lucy was stomping, that feel like eyeballs or whatever.

Right, well, banana peels.

And then yeah, like some of this like inedible, you know, like the strap of a J.A.sport backpack or stuff like that.

Funny.
