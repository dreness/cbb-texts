♪♪♪ My Dark Knight of the Soul was a darker night for my toilet bowl.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Hmm, alright.

Thank you to Call Waiting for Godot for that catchphrase submission, and welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

And a week in the middle of October, probably the spookiest month of all.

If I had to rank the months in terms of spookiness, October's up there, definitely.

It's probably number one, I would say.

I don't know, November though.

I don't know. Oh, and those ghosts of Christmas past, present and future in December?

Alright, that's number one.

That's terrifying.

Then October, this is number two.

We have a great episode for you today.

By the way, my name is Scott Ochreman.

We have some wonderful guests coming up.

A little later we have an attorney.

We also have a coach.

Whoo!

I wonder if it's coach.

What was his name again?

Actual coach?

What was that guy's name?

He played, he was in one of those Pixar movies.

Mr. Incredible with my beloved Miss Incredible.

Elastigirl.

We also have a comedian of note and an author.

I'm looking at him right now, and why don't I just bring him on to the show?

He's the person I'm looking at.

That's primarily what he's known for.

Nope, he's not behind you.

I'm looking right at you.

You're next.

He is one of the original cast members of Saturday Night Live.

No, that's not true.

Feels like it though, doesn't it?

It feels like pre-original.

Before SNL was even a thing, you were there.

Well, Scott, the original cast members were Chris Jalballushi, Chevy Chase, Gilla Ratnar, Seder, like Josh Ratnar's sister.

Christian Wake, you know, those people.

But I was like following, I was maybe two or three casts after that.

Yeah.

This was back in the 1900s.

Right, exactly.

Like 1902, 1903.

Yeah.

It was pre-prohibition, wasn't it?

It was, but can I back up for one second?

Yeah, please.

You said October was the scariest month as a child, but as you get older, you know, it's the most scariest month?

April, April 15th.

Tell me about it.

Right?

And also Easter when it lands because like that dude got killed and then suddenly he's a ghost?

Well, apparently.

I mean, that's what they say.

Yeah, that's what they say.

It feels like an apocryphal story.

If you believe a book that was written thousands of thousands of thousands of years.

Maybe 2000 years.

And hundreds of years after this guy died.

Yeah.

I mean, it just, it feels like a weird tale.

But yeah, you're right.

April is just terrifying.

Yeah.

And also may when you haven't filed your taxes and they come after you and they sue you and arrest you.

Do you know what I heard during the pandemic?

What's that?

A lot of sneezing, a lot of coughing?

Yeah, there was a lot of people that were, had allergies, I guess.

And a lot of people that didn't believe there was allergies.

But the IRS didn't really come out of a lot of people, come after a lot of people during that time because they were, of course, protecting themselves and staying away from people.

So yeah, they were not.

Yeah, they were not.

A good time you cheated on your taxes.

That's a good idea.

Exactly.

Yeah.

Although are they moving backwards now and going like, okay, we gave you a break.

You know what?

I stopped working for the IRS.

So I don't really know their schedule.

By the way, there is no law that says you have to pay taxes.

That's right.

It's not a government thing.

Yeah, it's not a government thing.

It's we just agree to do it.

No, stop paying taxes.

That's why I'm here to tell everyone.

You know, I'll be honest with you.

I thought that was the case where it wasn't a government institution, but then someone said, well, actually it is.

Oh, we did it.

Okay.

Yeah.

And then they said no.

Then they said no.

It's not real.

They said no again.

Yeah.

Okay.

I'm back to.

But ultimately they settled in yes, it was.

I don't know what to think anymore.

I know.

Isn't that true?

He's one of the original cast members of Saturday and I live back in 1902.

He is, of course, an author now his new book.

I exaggerate comes out this week, October 25th.

Anywhere books are sold or given away or only books that are fantastic books or fine books.

Yeah.

Who published this?

This is published by Abrams publishing.

Abrams interesting.

And it was written by me, Kevin Nealon.

Kevin Nealon is here.

Hi, Kevin.

All right.

Take it easy, everybody.

It's actually it's called hands up.

It's called I exaggerate.

Is that like I robot?

No, it's I exaggerate my brushes with fame.

So it's kind of a play on words there.

I paint these famous people that are most of them are a lot of my friends of mine.

And then I write a little antidote about them.

Interesting.

Maybe Carvey.

Let's see who else you're struggling to think of a third person and you wrote the book.

Well, I'm not a mind reader.

I can't read my own mind.

It's a good point.

What do you have psychic powers?

ESPN doesn't exist.

Yeah, I like the book right here.

I'm just looking at Chris for walk in and what cowbell Steve Martin.

So that's Steve Martin that looks like Fauci.

See Martin looks like Fauci.

I'm just a little bit like Fauci too.

But your friends with Buzz Aldrin, Jim Carrey, Andy Kaufman, Matt Aldrin.

Your friends with him?

I was.

Were you really?

Were you a contemporary of his?

Take it easy.

I'll calm down.

Did you do clubs and stuff with them?

I was, you know, when I first moved to LA, when I was a lad of 25, 26 years old, I used to bartend at the improvisation for a couple of years.

And I used to hang out there.

So I'd see all the comics come in from Rob Williams to Andy Kaufman, Steve Martin, you know, anybody who was coming in there.

And I was in awe because I wanted to be a stand up and I was doing open mic nights.

And Andy Kaufman would come in and I used to love him.

He was one of the guys that influenced me, him, Steve Martin and Scott Ockerman.

Wow.

Oh my God.

Thank you so much.

Yeah.

Did I influence you to do what though?

To do it.

You influenced me not to get into the business.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

But you know, you have to have a little bit of both.

Yeah, that was an influence and you decided to overcome that influence.

Yeah.

So, so anyway, I would see him coming in and out.

I was intimidated by him and one day near the end of his life, he came in with just a Mohawk haircut.

It was a glue on Mohawk because he was going through cancer and that's so funny and more.

Is it?

I mean, I'm still laughing, but black leather jacket with a size.

I have a dark sense of humor, by the way.

Oh, don't we all?

Oh, man.

Like it's like Danny DeVito who directed throw mama from the train.

That's how dark my sense of humor is.

So anyway, you know, maybe a year or two after I started working there, I saw him and I knew he was into transcendental meditation.

TM as they call it.

TM, yeah, short.

And so I ate him, asked him short for that.

If I asked him about that outside and I knew he liked it and he talked about it.

So I knew that was a way to kind of, you know, connect with him, connect with him and break the ice.

So he talked about it for like a half hour with me, never really letting me kind of interject anything.

And I just, I didn't even listen to him.

He was outside on the street in front of the impromptu, I just looked at his face and I can hear him like in a distance, go, you know, and then the transcendental meditation.

And, you know, and I'm just looking at the moles on his face.

I'm trying to connect the moment.

I see any coffin right there.

I don't know what he's talking about, but I'm really feel relaxed right now.

This is how I feel right now listening to you.

You did.

Yeah, I do.

Last time I was here, you were playing with the magic marker too.

Yeah, exactly.

You look funny how you remember things like that.

Yeah.

Same one.

And last time you were on the show, by the way, you are our second guests on the, you were on our second episode.

But last time you were on the show, you yawned during the entire show.

What does that mean though?

What does an insecure person think that means?

It said to me that you were not enjoying it, but in retrospect, you were probably just very early.

Well, let me tell you what it means.

And the rest of the fact I was not yawning.

I was trying to get a word in edgewise.

So every time I went home, I was like, Hey, and you would just cut me off.

So let's take a break.

We'll be right back.

So Andy Kaufman, did you then start to do transcendental meditation?

I did.

Not right.

Not right then.

I started doing it about 10 years ago.

And how is that?

It's great.

Are you still doing it?

I mean, right now.

Have you been continuously doing it for 10 years?

You're doing it right now.

I do it like twice.

I don't do it every day.

It's supposed to do it twice a day.

Twice a day.

And how long are you supposed to do it?

20 minutes a session.

And I don't do that every day.

I did it one day, 10 years ago.

No, I tried to do it as much as I can.

Like just like when I can't sleep and I do it like last night I did it.

Oh, really?

And it put me right out.

So I don't have trouble getting to sleep.

So waking up.

It's yeah, I have trouble waking up every single day.

You're so lucky.

Are you awake now?

I'm not sure.

But my wife has to shake me and say, wake up, wake up.

Really?

Yeah.

She has to get the defibrillator out.

You fall asleep easily?

I fall asleep very easily.

Is it because of the alcohol or?

Oh, yeah, definitely.

Of course.

It's just waking up in the middle of the night.

That's my issue.

And how often do you go to the bathroom?

A day or in the middle of the night?

You're probably five.

Five times.

Wow.

You look a camel.

Do you live standing up?

Does a camel store it all in the humps?

Is that what makes those egg humps?

No, no, no, no.

They have those little ecological green like canisters they keep in it?

Oh, they do.

Yeah.

I said, how much off?

Do you have five times a night, you think?

Five times a night?

No, no.

I wake up probably after six hours of sleep every single night, no matter what time it is, be it four in the morning, five in the morning, and then I'm up for about an hour playing.

Oh, my God, you're yawning.

No, I'm trying to get a word in.

I'm trying to get a word in.

Get your word in, please.

Well, that's not, that's, you sleep like a five-year-old.

Oh, thank you.

Is that a compliment?

I can't quite tell.

It is.

I mean, you're not a diapers still, right?

You're not a diapers.

Well, no, not yet.

I'm going to get a ball because I wear diapers at night.

Take a break.

And we're back, ladies and gentlemen.

You can just join us and talk with Scott Ockermann.

Kevin, you, this book I exaggerate.

You...

No, it is a book.

It is a book, right?

It has pages.

Oh, okay.

Yes.

Your book, is it just people you've met or have you drawn people that you'd like to meet and you'd tell anecdotes about them or...

That's a good question.

Is it?

It's both.

I've never met him.

And I know and people that I've met briefly or people that I've heard about or I'm a fan about, like Freddie Mercury.

I've always been a queen fan.

But you've never met him.

I've never met him.

You've got to meet him.

No.

But I do have a replica of his teeth.

You do.

From...

Why did he make a replica?

Is that like...

I made the replica.

He was always showing and he was yawning and I stuck some clay in there and I got a quick little imprint.

Because who was that woman, the plaster caster woman who made the plaster penises of all the rock stars?

Oh, I don't know about that.

I think I would be more tempted to do Freddie Mercury's teeth than his actual...

That's a good idea.

Yeah.

That's a good idea.

I believe Kiss wrote this song, plaster caster, about her.

I didn't know that.

She did Jimi Hendrix.

She did everyone.

After you do Jimi Hendrix, there's no point in anyone else doing it.

That's true.

I mean, there's some people in this book, Scott, that you wouldn't think about I'd met, but I did.

I used to go a lot of Carrie Fisher parties.

Oh, really?

She's in it too.

Yeah.

So these are the parties back in the 80s or the 70s?

In the 80s and 90s.

Yeah.

She was a notorious partier.

She rose...

Actually in the 2000s too.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

She wasn't so much a partier, but she had a partier...

She was back in the day.

She had a lot of parties at her home on Coldwater Canyon and it was...

I mean, the people that you saw there, everyone from Harrison Ford to authors...

You're just naming Star Wars people right out here.

Yeah, you're vodka.

You're vodka.

You're vodka too.

C3PO.

Wado.

Mickey Mouse.

Oh, no, he wasn't in the house.

But yeah, it was crazy.

So I got up off the couch once at one of her parties and I turned and there's Elizabeth Taylor.

Whoa.

Old Violet eyes herself.

Yeah.

And I just immediately said to her.

I said, hi, Liz.

How are you?

Like I was, you know, like a long time French.

She goes, oh, I'm all right.

I'm having back problems now.

You never want to ask somebody over 70 how they're doing, you know?

And so she went on about her back and I said, you know, Liz, I used to get back problems too.

And I said, do you try ice?

And she goes, oh honey, I don't do ice.

I do frozen peas.

I said, just one or two to know the whole bag.

And because they conform to your body, whatever bone it's on, and you just put it right on there.

And I thought, that's a good idea.

So I went home, I got a bag of peas because I am always like hurting something because I'm quite an athlete.

Did you not have peas before that?

No, it was just ice cubes.

Yeah.

But I mean, you didn't even keep peas in the house.

Are you not a P guy?

Well, in our culture, we don't eat peas.

Right.

Yeah.

So.

Now I'm yawning.

I was sleeping.

They said this would wake me up this show, but I don't know.

I'm not quite sure at this point.

So anyway, yeah, we are taping this.

To be fair, we're taping this at four in the morning because I woke up and I called everyone together.

I keep my house peas.

Good.

And so I always had a bag of peas in there and I use it all the time.

I've been in a block of ice or peas for the last 25 years.

Yeah.

What's going on with you?

You're a basketball player.

Yeah, you are, of course, an athlete.

That's how you started.

Yeah.

Still professionally, too.

Yeah, exactly.

You did SNL.

The good part was he was...

I'm not going to say that.

SNL was technically the...

I'm not going to say that for my peas.

The off season in between basketball, right?

That was actually, you're right.

Yeah.

You're right about that.

That was just a side thing for me to do because I was actually playing a lot of sports.

So yeah, I've had these peas.

I had one same bag of peas for a long time that I kept in my freezer maybe for like five years and I called it my Elizabeth, the Wilson for Hanks in Castaway.

And one time my mother-in-law came over, she made us all dinner and I came in there and I see peas in the bowl.

Oh no.

I see what you get these peas from.

So they're the freezer.

I mean, you can't even read that they're peas anymore because the label has been worn off and there's been gay all on it.

And so the peas taste a little minty, you know?

Because yeah, it was from the freezer.

I said, no, not my Elizabeth.

Not my back peas.

Yeah.

So I had to get...

I switched to corn for a while.

Oh really?

Well, that was...

It's a little too pointy.

It was just like an affair.

That's all that well.

Yeah, exactly.

So you have your peas back.

My peas kicked me back.

Yeah.

Now they have these ice packs though that can conform to your body and they're like ice gels.

I use those now.

Yeah.

No more peas.

I've had a lot of joints replaced.

No kidding.

Really?

Yeah, I had this knee replaced about four weeks ago.

Four weeks ago.

Looks a little bulky actually.

Well, that's the case I put around it.

Oh, I see.

Oh, it comes in the case.

Yeah, it's an old guitar case.

Is it mint?

Condition.

It's got mints, some peas in there.

Yeah.

I've got a call backs.

It's SNL original cast in there.

Yeah, we got the amp and the referee and the gardener.

What other...

I mean, you're stroking your knee right now.

What else have you had replaced?

You tell me.

Okay.

True or false?

Okay.

I had my tibular replaced in 2010.

Can I take a look at it?

Yeah.

I'm going to say just because you know the word tibula.

True.

Well, first of all, the tibula is in the arm.

Not the leg.

Oh, shit.

You already threw me.

And I only knew that when I started thinking about it.

Okay, damn it.

But that is true.

Oh, it is true.

No, I had six years ago.

By the way, I went to my...

I'll get back to this in a couple hours.

But I want to get physical because I had my knee replaced.

Why'd you get a physical before that?

Because if they figure you're not going to live, why do it?

Right.

So you sit in the doctor...

Have you ever had a physical?

Yeah, you usually try to get them once a year.

Yeah.

You try to.

Yeah.

Yes.

And he looks at his computer screen.

He's going over your history.

And he's looking at mine.

And he's scrolling down the computer screen.

He says, okay, you had a hernia on your seven, penicitis.

You had tumor in your neck removed.

You're 21, benign tumor.

You had an ablation of your heart.

You had torn bicep muscles repaired.

You had a hip replaced.

I said, okay, all right, I think that's enough.

I think I'm so depressed here and it all.

Then he goes on to the medications.

Okay, you're taking...

And tropolol, you're taking...

Synthroid.

It's like an hour ago.

It was like a grocery list for a family of 10.

How many pills do you take a day?

10.

10 a day.

That's just 10 prescription pills.

Then I take the vitamins.

The vitamins.

And then I have five placebo's I take.

Good.

I would not get rid of them at all.

Of course.

Yeah.

Because I have some diseases that don't exist that are killing me.

Are you good like I am of like...

I've reached a certain age where now I'm an expert at pouring out exactly seven pills from a bottle in order to put into the pill.

Yeah, you kind of estimate.

Yeah.

And then you go down.

How many pill boxes do you fill up at once?

I just do one at a time.

You want to keep them fresh?

Yeah, always.

Yeah, I do the whole year.

Really?

Do you label them?

50 pill boxes.

No I don't.

But I have to get a bigger pill box because the one I have now is not big enough.

I have to sit on it like a suitcase to close it.

And I'm just trying to cut down though.

I'm getting rid of some.

If somebody prescribes like a new medication for me, I have to get rid of something that's in the pill box.

Yeah.

It's like take a penny, leave a penny.

Yeah.

I'll switch out a diaphorium.

I'm going to get it up.

And diaphorium for a synthesis.

Where are these synthroids?

Synthroids.

You mentioned before what is F4.

That's for the thyroid.

Oh, for the thyroid.

And it synthesizes thyroid activity is what I'm guessing.

You know what?

I'm not really a doctor.

Oh, you're not.

I'm an honorary doctor.

You are wearing a doctor's outfit right now, which I thought was very weird.

You have the big, it's like a radar dish on your head.

Yeah, it's the pandemic stuff still.

Oh, okay.

You also have a t-shirt that says FBI federal booty inspector.

Yes, that is actually correct.

But anyway, let's go back to the three choices.

Yeah, true or false.

Okay.

So you know I have the knee.

I know you have the knee.

You have two others or you have three others.

Just one of the knee.

Okay.

And then I have two other joints that I had replaced.

Okay.

Ankle.

True or false?

I'm going through that myself right now.

I'm going to take a look at that.

And you're featuring that foot, which leads me to believe it's the other one.

So you're saying it's true, Ankle?

I'm moving on a false.

Okay.

You're going to give me a little more time than this.

I was going to say false though.

Right.

Try and treat place.

Eyeball socket.

God, this one seems like it's true, but a whole soft.

It's false.

Okay.

Left hip.

That one's true.

Right hip.

Damn it.

Yeah.

Wait, I thought you meant left to me.

My left hip.

Like if I'm always...

No, it's stage, stage left.

Oh, it's stage.

Oh, for the next.

So it's up stage hip.

Yeah, up stage hip.

Got it.

Right shoulder.

False.

True.

I'm bad at this game.

So tell me the ones that I've ever replaced.

Shoulder.

Okay.

So you have the right shoulder, you have the right hip, and you have the right knee.

Yeah.

So all on that side, what's going on on that side?

I'm right at it.

I used to play football in college, seriously.

And I was a kicker.

And you would...

And the quarterback and the punter.

So everything was happening on the right side.

In one game?

Every game.

So you would throw it.

Yeah.

You would kick the ball after you threw it?

Well, when we got...

We made a touchdown, we got it on the other hand, I punted the ball.

Sure.

Hard kick it.

And what happened was, I always wanted to play football.

And I never played in high school, because we moved a lot.

And but we played a lot of sand lot of football in my neighborhood.

It was good.

No refs.

Because we played these gangs from across town on the football field when the high school is where he is in it.

That's where you want to do it on the football field.

Not in the streets.

So my friend Bill Brackett, who was a fireman after that, he says, Kev, we can go to Fair Fleet University.

And we could take one night course, three credits, saying criminology.

And that'll qualify us to play in their club football field.

How did he bring up criminology?

Because most people say, what course did you take?

Like English or something.

That would be the...

Why?

I went to college already.

I had all that stuff.

Right.

So you wanted to take criminology?

I wanted to play football.

I wanted to be a football-playing criminologist.

Yeah.

I wanted to find out if there's any criminals on the team.

And we're there.

Yeah.

They're all criminals.

But anyway, so I did that for a year.

The starting quarterback got hurt, so I got to play.

I only went to three criminology classes.

What did you learn in those three?

Anything that you still used today?

It's not important to go to criminology classes.

Oh, I see.

Wow.

Anyway.

Finger printing?

No, they don't do fingerprinting anymore.

Did you know that?

Really.

I don't think I do it anytime I have to sign a document or whatever.

Maybe I'm thinking about something else.

Okay.

Taxes.

I'm thinking about taxes.

Oh, right.

We're like, like, stoners, man.

We're just sitting here.

There's no, like, through line for anything.

Welcome to the comedy-bank.

The comedy-bank.

My book is coming out tomorrow, actually.

Oh, that's right.

It's 25th.

It's the likes I had to write my brushes with fame.

I know.

But did you ever finish your football stuff?

Because you were talking about your right side and why you would...

Well, it's funny you should say that because that's in the book.

It is in the book.

It's not in the book.

This is the book.

See, I don't mean to criticize your book that's out, but this is the book.

You know, talking about your right hand side.

Life is the book.

And it never ends until one day, suddenly, in the middle of a chapter, done.

Yeah.

All right, getting back to the football.

I played the full season.

Got MVP.

Most valuable.

In person?

In person.

Excuse me.

What's going on with your...

Yeah.

We have a spittoon over here.

You just want to...

I'm at the CVB spittoon.

So anyway, my goal...

So the next year I came back, I would keep going back there if they never said anything.

And I guess some jealous football players, some of the team that weren't playing that much said, hey, man, this isn't fair.

So they changed the 12 credits.

You got to take 12 credits.

So I signed up for four criminology classes that night.

Simultaneously?

Simultaneously.

A lot of people don't know you can do that.

Just to get 12 credits, you can sign up for the same class four times.

Yeah.

All at the same time.

Yeah.

It's crazy.

So here's my plan, Scott.

Sorry.

Yapping.

I thought I'm going to go to LA because I want to do stand-up comedy.

But also I want to be trial for Kicker for the LA Express as part of the USFL at the time.

Oh, right.

Yeah.

So that was my goal.

So if I became a comic, that would have been my hook.

Here he is.

He's a comedian, but he's also the Kicker for the Los Angeles Rams, LA Express.

It sounds horrible.

Yeah.

I went out and I bought like eight USFL footballs.

It was a different league at the time.

There's two different leagues.

And they're a little bit lighter footballs.

Were they bigger or smaller?

They're about the same size.

Okay.

And I go to Fairfax High and I practice kicking for an hour a day.

And I thought, this is going to be great, man.

But my stand-up took off quicker than tryouts.

Right.

So I said, what's that?

That's so strange that stand-up would take off quicker than just going and getting a tryout for a USFL team.

Yeah.

But you were such a good stand-up that it just you skyrocketed to play.

Well, I would go to Fairfax High every day with my stand-up and just work it out on the field.

The field right there.

Were the Red Hot Chili Peppers famously formed there?

Were they there at the time?

They were.

But another true or false?

I was on an airplane once with Anthony- Cheetahs?

Cheetahs, yeah.

I'm going to say- I'm going to say false.

True.

What?

No.

He was flying the plane.

Whoa.

Incredible.

No, it's false.

That's false.

Okay.

All right.

And this book is filled with stories like this, which may be true, may not be true.

Oh, you keep going back to the book.

All right.

Do you attest that everything in this book is true?

Will you sign a legal document?

I haven't read it yet, but I would expect it to be true.

Yeah, it is all true.

Everything is true.

Do you have a ghost writer at all?

No.

But I do- I also do people on airplanes.

Oh.

Like on Fly A Love.

What do we have here?

Is that Bill Clinton?

No.

It's a guy with his dog.

Oh.

But these are all people.

Maybe it is Bill Clinton.

Maybe he had his dog on the fly.

You know what that is, Bill Clinton?

I didn't know he was on my fly.

But I have, like I said, Buzz Aldrin.

Have you ever met Buzz Aldrin?

Where would I have met Buzz Aldrin?

Well, I met him on a beach in Mexico, so you couldn't have met him anywhere.

Okay, that's true.

Maybe I'll start hanging out at beaches.

And I recognize him.

Was he wearing the spacesuit?

He was actually, and he was on the moon.

And you waved to him.

They come down here.

And they have Mexican beaches on the moon.

I didn't know that.

I didn't know there was a Mexican territory there.

So I recognize him.

And I go over to him.

I say Buzz.

He goes, yeah.

I go, oh my God.

I'm like, not a fan.

But I...

You can't really be a fan of an astronaut.

No, you can't.

I follow all your moon landings.

But anyway, I said, I know who you are.

And I said, were you ever like scared that you wouldn't get off the moon?

You'd be stuck there.

Yeah.

I said, what are you, a wise guy?

Why am I a wise guy?

I didn't say that, but I'm thinking, why am I a wise guy?

I said, I'm just curious.

I said, no, I'm just curious because if I were on the moon and there's only one way to get off, I'd be a little nervous.

I hope...

He goes, why wouldn't the thing work?

I said, well, sometimes I get into my car, it doesn't work.

And then he realized that I was serious.

He goes, well, we did get into the lunar module and we saw a little fuse was sticking out.

And so we just called Houston.

They said, push it back in.

I said, okay, good talking to you, Buzz.

You walked away shaking your head.

What a weirdo.

I mean, yeah, I would think that, okay, say the...

What did he ride there in?

Like a spaceship or whatever.

Is a lunar module?

Lunar module.

Say that doesn't work.

What is he like, call home and go like, can you send another one?

That's the thing.

Does he have enough rations?

No.

No, he dies there, right?

No, they don't die there.

They have the courtyard mariots or everything.

Oh, okay.

So they would stay in the courtyard mariot and...

Did anybody ever tell you, are you ever serious?

Because I get that a lot.

Yeah.

I think we were in a race to say it to each other.

Or sometimes this happened to you, you'll be telling somebody something serious and they're looking for the punchline.

Right, yeah.

It's like, I don't know what you're telling a joke or you.

And this is what happened with Buzz because he probably being an original SNL fan, a fan of the original guest.

And he was one of the cast members of the movie.

He did update, didn't he?

He did update and also he did the Rosanna Bandana character.

A lot of makeup.

Let's just try to have one real serious conversation.

Okay, let's have a real serious conversation.

The book comes out on a short story.

Are you...

Let me just show you another picture here.

Are you worried about it coming out so close to Halloween?

There's Freddie Mercury.

There he is.

No, in fact, I'm glad you said that.

Cany's not healthy.

It's about Cany's not healthy for kids.

Give out my book.

Yeah.

I'm not sure about Halloween forever.

And guess what?

You know what else is coming after that?

Hanukkah?

Christmas?

Right.

All those other holidays.

Thanksgiving.

What a great gift.

Look at it.

It's not a big coffee table book either.

It's...

I'm not a good joke.

You don't have to have a huge table in order to display this book.

You don't have to have a coffee table.

Yeah, you don't even have to like coffee.

You don't have to have any tables.

You can put this on the floor.

You can put it on the floor.

You can stomp all over it.

Can we try again to have a serious conversation?

Okay, here we go.

Well, I am looking forward to reading this book.

You don't have a copy for me, so I don't know how I'll ever get there.

But...

Tell me who that is.

That's Matt LeBlanc, is it not?

Yes, it is.

I worked with him for four years on a show called Man with a Plan.

What is that?

What is it?

Yeah.

It's a television show.

They have them on those...

You're lying right.

This is a lie right now.

Okay, let's start off.

Let's start off.

I'm going to start the conversation.

Okay.

Because you seem to always take it in the direction that there's Carrie Fisher.

There she is, yeah.

Yeah.

With those signature glasses of course.

Ah!

That's the book closing on Scott's penis right there.

My penis.

I don't know why he's shaking his hand.

Because that's what I like to touch my penis with.

All right, here we go.

You're right, let's try it right now.

Okay, here we go.

Serious, how are you Scott?

I'm doing well.

Are you happy?

Yeah, generally.

Yeah, thank you so much.

Are you happy?

I've known you a long time.

Thank you for caring.

Okay, we can't do it.

Feels false.

You're like...

Yeah, a semi-series conversation before...

I mean, it lasted maybe three sentences.

I asked about your wife, who I know.

Yeah.

And you said she was good.

And we said, okay.

Well, let me follow up with this one.

Okay, do you know CPR?

I do.

You do, really?

Yes, I do.

Do you need some?

How much do you have?

I have maybe 30 counts plus a couple of breaths.

The first time I did your show was your second show.

Second show?

Wasn't I dressed up like a postman or something?

You had me dressed up like a postman.

Oh, no, that was the television show.

I'm at the podcast.

You were on the second episode of the podcast.

I have no collection of that.

You were dressed as a postman on the Comedy Bang Bang television show.

You were delivering mail in a sketch for us.

And you were kind enough to do that.

Yeah, that was a big thrill for us that day.

We watched around saying, Kevin's coming.

Did you date a lot in high school?

No.

Because you didn't go to high school.

Yeah, I dated a lot in the high school years, of course.

I was just like railing chicks from 14 to 18.

But I just was not in high school.

Let's try to be serious.

Come on.

Did you, why do you ask if I dated a lot in high school?

Because I didn't.

I did not.

You did not.

You were an athlete.

High school.

Not in high school.

I didn't know every time I was an athlete.

What were you doing in high school then?

I was just going to school and scared.

Really?

Yeah, because I was a late bloomer.

I was 5'8", when I graduated from high school.

You were, because you're so tall now.

Six for now.

Yeah.

And I weighed about 180.

I had some baby fed on me.

And I was very shy.

No facial hair or body hair.

And you know.

Even on the above the nowhere.

Nowhere.

Not even under the toenails.

Wow.

And I go in the locker room and I was like a baby seal.

And I'd see all these guys are like men.

You know.

Their voices have changed.

Yeah.

And they've full beards.

Full beards.

They're wearing business suits.

They have briefcases.

They have kids.

They've got kids in the locker room with them.

So anyway, I was a little intimidated by that.

And these girls are always going out with those guys.

They're older too.

You know, high school girls.

They had the souped up cars.

That's the thing.

High school girls go out with college guys.

Yeah.

So that's why when you're in high school you have to go out with junior high school.

High school girls.

No, take it easy now.

Take it easy.

So what are your thoughts about deaf?

Well, I don't think I'm going to do it.

I've decided I'm just going to I'm going to give it a pass.

Yeah.

What about you?

You know, the older I get the less afraid I am of it.

Yeah.

And the older I get the less.

I think I'll even know that I died.

Yeah.

That's the thing.

I don't want anyone to tell me if I've died.

Nobody will.

Yeah.

You know, I just want to I just wanted to happen.

Are you afraid you're going to miss stuff?

That's the thing that I worry about.

Like I don't want to I want to be there for this.

I want to be there for this.

No, I'm talking about Marvel movies that have been announced.

I'll tell you why I'm no phone up for death because when I was born all this stuff happened before me.

Yeah.

I didn't miss out on that.

You've heard about it at this point.

Yeah.

Scott, I got to take another break here and we'll come back.

Let's talk more about death and let's talk about life.

Yeah.

And everything in between.

Living in the moment.

That's true.

What do you do for fun?

For fun?

Wow.

I usually like to I see friends.

I'm not like one of the real.

Do you read a lot?

I do read.

Yeah.

A lot.

Yeah.

What do you read right now?

It's a great book.

It's a really good bargain.

You're thinking of a title where he has a lot of books and sightings.

But it's the Bible.

Kevin.

Is that true?

That's true.

He's just created the world.

Oh, I won't tell you what happens.

We do have to take a break, Kevin, if that's all right.

Can you stick around though for the entire show?

We have some incredible guests coming up.

I need your wisdom, your wit.

Why are you looking at your wrist right now?

They're not even a watch out.

I think I might have to have a replace.

Oh, okay.

That's your left one.

Yeah.

When we come back, we are going to talk to a coach.

Who's who played coach?

Which is Brian Craig Nelson.

Craig T. Nelson.

That's right.

You know what the T stands for?

What?

Tyrannosaurus.

True or false?

Tyrannosaurus.

I think that's true.

But we'll see if it's Craig T. Nelson who's going to be here.

We also have an attorney.

We'll be right back with more Kevin Nealon, more comedy bang back after this.

Comedy bang back.

We're back.

We have Kevin Nealon.

His book, I Exaggerate, is in stores this week, October 25th.

And it has pictures.

It has a collection of my caricature work.

Anytime I see you drawing, anytime you've been on this show, other than today, you've drawn on the table.

A lot of these tables that are in the year-old studios have your drawings on them.

That's correct.

Yeah.

You draw a lot.

I do like to draw.

I've been drawn since I was a kid.

Yeah.

You have so many talents.

Basketball, football, you're a kicker, you're a punter, you're a quarterback, stand of comedy, acting.

Put your knee replaced, do your shoulder.

Right.

Okay, enough for it.

Patient.

And you also draw.

I do.

I draw and I do digital artwork.

And I just love it.

And finally, I was starting to do it more and more.

I started taking these classes from this guy in England, Paul Moise, over Skype.

Really?

And he was kind of showing me the latest stuff on how to do with digital artwork and caricatures.

And it was 500 pounds for no euros, for 10 lessons.

What's the latest in character work?

What new advances are they making in caricatures?

Oh my God.

Instead of playing soccer, now you're dabbing?

Well, if you look at some of the older caricature work, I've never thought about this until you brought it up.

But it has changed quite a bit.

The way people exaggerate features.

I'm at that point now where I can't walk around on the street and look at people and see them normally.

I have to think, okay, that has to be done.

I would exaggerate that.

It knows.

Yeah, it's like being in a funhouse, you know?

Right, yeah.

But, you know, it has, if you look at some of the older caricature work.

Is that Prince?

Well, let me show you the other Prince.

Okay.

So that looks the most like Prince out of all the princes that you've done.

Because you have about- No, no, this is the evolution.

Yeah, you have about six tries at Prince in the book.

And that's what I do also on my internet site, Kevin Nealon Artwork.

I will do the finished picture.

And then the next one over is the evolution.

Okay.

How I got there.

Yeah.

So, yeah, so that's what I like to do.

I like to do that.

But there are some- Oh, I was going to tell you about the Prince.

You were going to tell me story.

Yeah.

If I could for one second.

I went to the SNL 40 of Reunion.

I remember that.

And it was at the Plaza Hotel, the rep party.

And Prince comes by.

And I see him.

And he sees me and we both smile at each other.

And this is exactly how he looked when he smiled at me.

You know, I thought I couldn't, you know, he just seemed like a different person.

He wasn't that sultry.

Right, yeah.

I was putting on a mistake.

And I was like, yeah.

Right, yeah.

And you swap personalities that way.

We talked for a little bit.

And then I introduced my wife as a huge Prince fan.

And then he laughed and she goes, oh my God, I can't believe Prince shook our hands.

He never touches anybody's hands.

I said, well, welcome to my world, baby.

Welcome to my world.

Did he play that party?

Yeah.

He played, yeah, didn't he?

Didn't I hear he played some songs?

Yeah.

Him and Taylor Swift, is that correct?

Was she playing that?

I actually didn't stay for that.

What is going on?

I'm not such a huge fan.

No, I didn't stick.

I didn't know he was going to play.

I wasn't home with the bed.

I was like three in the morning.

Do you regret it?

No.

Being honest, I know.

I mean, no, I was tired.

You're tired during a s&l?

Oh, during s&l?

Yeah.

I was tired a lot.

Well, that's the problem.

See, this show is on it 11.30 at night on Saturdays, famously.

And it's not on because it's ready.

It's on because it's 11.30 at times.

Yeah, on Saturdays, famously.

It's too late.

Like any self-respecting comedian is going to be in bed by 9.9.30.

It's not out doing the clubs?

Yeah.

Well, here's the thing for me.

When I first went to that studio in 30 Rock, Studio 8H.

Rockefeller Plaza.

I walked in there and I got really tired.

Mm-hmm.

And then I realized that's because I used to fall asleep watching that show.

Really?

In the association thing, I started seeing the same walls and I got really sleepy.

Is that why you were yawning the last episode?

No, I was trying to get a word in edgewise.

That was just my mouth opening.

Alright, let's get started.

Let's talk to these other people.

We have a coach coming on the show now.

Oh, I love as a Craig T. Nelson.

It is not Craig T. Nelson.

I'm seeing his name right here.

There are no C's in it.

There's no T and there's certainly not a Nelson.

But his name is Donald Ump.

Let's welcome him.

Hi.

Hey, how you doing?

Donald.

Do we call you Don or Don?

Whatever you'd like.

Yeah.

Whatever I'd like.

Yeah.

I mean Don.

A lot of latitude.

Yeah.

Do you have something else you prefer?

I'm not quite sure.

But this is Kevin.

Nice to meet you.

Don't worry.

I'm good.

How are you?

Great.

You look great.

Oh, thank you.

Yeah, it's the tiny hat.

How tiny is that hat?

That's incredibly small.

The bowl fits perfectly.

It's a normal sized bowl, but the bill is very tiny.

Right.

So it's an optical illusion.

People think it's actually a small hat.

It's just a small bill.

It's like force perspective.

Yes.

The further away you get from it, you go, oh, that's a normal sized hat.

Yes.

It looks good on him.

Yeah.

I don't know who would look good on you, Kevin, I gotta say.

Not a lot of people pull off this look.

The umpire look, the huge fat stomach and the tiny bill hat.

Not a lot of people do.

But yeah, you definitely, is that what you are?

You're, because you said you were a coach.

Yeah, I'm an umpire coach.

I teach umps how to ump.

Oh, okay.

That's interesting.

That is interesting.

I wonder how they learned all that stuff.

Exactly.

People think you know how to do balls and strikes.

You know how to make the calls.

You know how to dust off the plate with the little brush.

I would assume if I watched one game on TV, I would get the gist of it.

Right?

Do you think a good housekeeper would be a good ump because they know how to clean the up?

Absolutely.

A lot of our best thumbs start as housekeeper.

Really?

Absolutely.

Dusters.

Can I bring something up that we just found out on this show?

Yeah.

Or maybe it was my other shows.

God hasn't seen.

Okay.

So all the plates, first base, the bases, I mean, first base, second base, third base, they're all squares.

Yep.

Home is that weird shape.

We just realized it's the shape of a house.

Yeah.

Home plate.

That's right.

Why are you young again?

I think I was just trying to get a word in.

You said home, I started thinking about my bed.

I understand.

I will try to stay away from words that have any sort of connection to your bed.

Yeah.

They didn't have an umpire at the field of dreams, didn't they?

I don't think so.

Did another guy come out of the cornfield to be the umpire?

I think he was shoelace.

Well, I'm so really mad.

I'm so really mad about that.

Shoelace, Joe Jackson, is that what you thought his name was?

Shoelace, Joe Jackson.

He's because he loves shoes so much he has so many legs.

He was skinny.

He was skinny, yeah.

Oh, that's true.

Can you still say skinny?

I think so.

Okay.

Yep.

Yeah, you can.

You can call him in.

You can call him out, you know, you're going to hit by a ball.

Oh, you're only coaching.

Yeah.

Do you actually ump yourself or are you doing games yourself or do you?

I'll ump sometimes.

It's more of a pastime for me now, you know, more of a hobby.

It's like America's pastime.

That's right.

Do you have another shadow you as your ump...

Yeah.

Do we see like training?

A trainee over your shoulder.

Yeah.

So it's just like a restaurant.

It's just like a restaurant where the server will come up and I'll be sort of behind them and going like, yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

So when he calls a strike, you go, take another look at that.

Yeah.

Well, a lot of what I'm doing is teaching the ump how to call the strike in a demonstrable way.

So what are your techniques?

What take us through some?

Well, there are several.

If it's a real down the middle strike, absolutely, you got to get really intense and you go, here.

Oh, nice.

The closer you are to pronouncing the word correctly, the harder it is for the audience to understand.

Right.

Now, what I've noticed is anytime it's a down the middle strike, the ump I've seen don't even say anything because it's like, what is there to be saying?

Everybody knows.

So they just go, they just point.

That's really good.

That's a seasoned pro.

Right.

Because all you need is just pink, pink, pink.

Yeah.

And everybody knows that's a strike.

And have you ever seen people call a ball?

No.

They barely do anything.

I only watch the strikes.

He goes, boom.

No, no.

The trick with the ball is you don't want to embarrass the pitcher.

So you just do a subtle standup.

Yeah, that's right.

Everybody knows it's a wrong.

I'm not going to call this one because we know.

I make sure I watch the games the day after and I do only the strike cuts.

That's a fascinating game.

My assistant just edited out all the balls.

That's really smart.

If it was, it's Kevin talking.

If I was a yump and I made a bad call, you know, like I go, that's good.

You must have taken a class.

They go, what are you?

That's a strike.

No, I'm not going to say strike.

I said, I don't know.

I don't know.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's confusing.

A lot of times during games, I'll get served food the whole time.

Popcorn, red robes, all of it.

Red ropes.

Yeah.

If I call a home run, I'll often get a red robe.

You call a home run.

I do.

I didn't know that the home, but I would think it would be just apparent to everyone that it was a home run.

Sometimes.

You have to call it otherwise it's not official.

Absolutely.

The scoreboard, those guys don't know the game.

They're just listening to us.

Oh, got it.

I have a mic that goes directly to the scoreboard guys.

Is that a second mic?

Huh?

You say?

Yeah.

Is that a second mic?

Because I know you're always mic'd up for the home audience as well.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, that's a big one.

So you have two different mics on you.

Two different lavs?

And I also have a Patreon where you can hear the real stuff.

You can hear the real stuff the ump is saying behind the plane.

How much is that, Patreon?

$200 an hour.

An hour?

That's a high Patreon.

Yeah, yeah.

There's only one subscriber.

It's my mom.

Hey, well, you can use one if you charge that much.

My son has the cool.

He watches so many of these videos, like on YouTube and stuff.

One of them is these athletes where they reinsert, they get their voice out and they put in other words.

They literally say or they dub something.

Yeah.

What do they say?

Oh, it's like stuff like, I don't care what your momma says.

You know?

That's a cool thing.

I'll take a pizza too.

Do people say that though?

I mean, you hear everything.

Yeah.

Yeah, those aren't really dubs.

Those are.

That's what I'm actually saying.

Wow.

Okay.

Yeah.

Those are like documentaries we're watching.

Yeah, absolutely.

Also, we're smart.

We're smart.

When we watch those.

Yeah, with Docs.

Docs.

What's up, Docs?

What's your favorite baseball movie out of all time?

Probably.

And follow up.

What's your favorite baseball?

My favorite baseball is the Rawlings 2.

Oh, yeah.

I don't mean style of baseball.

I mean, you're literal the ball that was your favorite.

Yeah, it's the Rawlings 2.

It's got beautiful, really beautiful.

No, no, no, no.

No, no, no.

Let me translate for you.

You get back in the dugout.

What's my client Scott is asking you is, do you have a particular baseball that really means a lot to you?

I mean, the specific ball, though.

Yeah.

I mean, you know, I don't mean the style of ball.

I mean, like one ball.

Yeah, in particular.

Yeah, it's the Rawlings 2.

It's this ball that was invented.

It's got red stitching and white.

You're talking about a style of ball.

Yes.

Let me step in if I could.

Scott, just sit down for a minute.

Thank you.

My client is asking you what kind of ball?

What kind of baseball?

The leather.

This is not what I'm asking Kevin.

All right.

Hang on a second.

I like a leather baseball.

They also make you fired.

Sorry.

We make a bright yellow baseball as well.

That's sort of fuzzy.

You can hit it with a racket.

I don't care.

What is your favorite baseball movie?

It's a Rawlings 2.

Your favorite baseball movie is a Rawlings 2.

Oh, sorry.

I wasn't listening.

I wasn't either, apparently.

My favorite baseball movie is probably the natural.

And what's your favorite pickleball movie?

Pickleball 2.

Yeah.

Pickleball 2 was a little derivative.

The natural.

Yeah.

It's great for baseball movies.

Great for titties.

That's right.

I'm mostly fast forward to the team.

Do you like that type of humor, Kevin?

I'm not really titty, you're a humor guy.

You're an ass humor guy.

I think it's juvenile.

You like titty humor and ass humor better?

Oh, well, definitely booty humor.

Booty humor is supposed to be booty.

You, I call it booty you.

Booty booty booty everywhere.

That's right.

So what are your other techniques to teach other umps?

And these are up and coming umps.

Yes.

Up and coming.

These are up and coming umps that want to get into the game.

You know what I mean?

A lot of umps are X baseball players who suck.

Is that true, really?

Oh, they love the game so much that they want to be around it.

We love the game.

You used to play baseball.

It's passion.

Well, I played tee ball.

Oh, professionally?

Yeah, I played professional tee ball.

Yeah, I got cut in farm when I was nine.

They said you're not good enough.

You're not good enough.

And so I switched over.

I was the youngest umpire in my city.

You were nine or 10 or?

I was 10.

You were 10.

I was 10.

Took me a lot of train.

Okay.

Yeah.

In your city.

In my city.

I mean, that's fine.

I thought you were going to save the world or whatever.

Well, I don't know.

In your city.

In my city.

That's all I know.

I was 10, Scott.

How big of a city?

Twenty thousand small city.

Yeah, it's not very big.

Wasn't that where the field of dreams was shot?

Yeah.

Yeah, it was from that city.

Yeah.

Oh, Iowa, Iowa.

Oh, Iowa.

Yeah, it's right on the border.

Right on the border.

You know what they call Ohio?

What's that?

OH10.

I like that.

It's like 10, pen 15.

Yeah, exactly.

It's like OH10.

Yeah.

Were you on pen 15?

I was the original cast member of the paper.

You were one of the girls?

Yeah, it's back in the 1900s.

I was actually in the pen 15 club in school.

You were.

Wow.

Yeah, people were.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You got, they wrote it on your arm and everything.

Yeah, it was a good club to be in.

I wasn't tricked.

Here's a little inside information.

If you do not know, it's not really pen 15.

It's penis because it's the pen and then the I, the one five looks like IS.

I don't know.

Take a look at it really.

I think it's a five obviously.

No, no, it's pen one five but they're really meaning to be pen.

I understand pen five.

No, no, because of the sensors they do it that way.

I don't know.

I don't know if that's true.

This is another one of your tricks, right?

False.

I'm kidding.

Yeah, you're right.

Can I ask you guys something everybody loves to do this?

Okay.

You guys want to throw a baseball at my chest?

Yeah.

Yeah, definitely.

All right.

So, I'm going to end up taking three feet back.

Okay.

You throw it as hard as you want but it's got to hit the chest.

Do you bring a baseball because I didn't bring mine today?

Absolutely.

I got a roll and you take the chest pad off.

Well, I don't want to.

Otherwise, I'll, why waste my arm on that?

Right, right.

All right, I guess I'll give it a shot.

Yeah, sure.

I mean, you guys are cool.

Yeah, where do you want us to hit you?

Right in the chest or right in the chest?

I'll pull the mask down, right?

Anywhere in the chest stomach, I usually wear a big pad there and that's.

Maybe 20 not to wear the mask.

Jesus Christ.

I'm wearing an athletic supporter right now.

Well, I'm wearing a cup.

I'll wear you or I'll give you 25 not to wear that.

Oh, geez.

This is $45.

All right.

Yeah, I mean, you know.

Let's round it off to 50.

Take your clothes off.

All right, let's go.

Let's go.

All right.

So, I'm nude in the studio.

Where's the wrong?

You take them off really fast.

Yeah.

So, what are those breakaway?

How far do you not make the show?

Okay.

How far do you not make much?

I need your sake because you have less clothes?

That's why it was so fast.

I'm still stuck on that.

Yes.

I'm out of money so you have less clothes.

Yes, I can afford anything but the umpire uniform.

Okay, got it.

These tiny hats are special.

Yeah.

You are still wearing the tiny hat.

That doesn't come off.

Okay.

That doesn't come off.

All right.

Kevin, you want to take the first shot or do them?

Sure.

Okay.

Yeah.

I haven't thrown a ball in quite a while.

Really?

But now I have a new shoulder, man.

I'm going to whiz it in there.

Oh, yeah.

It's like a RoboCop shoulder.

I know it.

All right.

Are we going to stand?

Yeah.

I'll stand here if that's okay.

All right.

We are kind of close.

10 feet in diameter.

Oh, incredible.

Yeah.

All right.

Yeah.

You have quite a span.

I do.

I'm like a velociraptor.

Yeah, you are.

In a lot of ways.

Yeah.

You're a clever girl.

Yeah.

All right.

Here we go.

All right.

Here we go.

Are you ready?

Yeah.

I'm going to give it a call.

Hit me right square in the chest.

Obviously that's a steam ride.

And if you miss it, it's a ball.

I'm putting a little tar on the ball if that's okay.

Absolutely.

Yeah.

That's what they do, right?

Whatever you want.

Yeah.

Because I want to do like a wicked curve right here.

Sure.

You don't want me to start with like a softer ball.

Or you can do whatever you want.

I'll start with the awful.

I'm taking shots from Randy Johnson.

Really?

Yeah.

That's a weird name.

Like he's Randy with his Johnson.

Oh, horny penis.

Yeah.

He just call himself horny penis.

You think it's a stage name?

You think he's funny?

I think he was like, much like Kevin deciding if he was going to be a kicker or a stand up comic.

He was like, do I play?

Well, and he killed that bird.

That was funny.

Did you ever see that?

I don't know.

Guys, I'm winding up.

I'm winding up.

I know.

You take a long time to wind up.

Every time I wind up, you start a conversation.

Sorry.

It's like barking.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

I don't mean to boke you.

All right.

Here we go.

I'm square to you.

Here's the strike zone right here at my chest.

All right.

Give me your best shot.

All right.

You're giving me permission to do this.

Mm-hmm.

Okay.

Ready?

Okay.

That's the last one.

Are you all right?

No, I don't get to do mine.

Well, how about the pateage?

I don't get to do it.

I'm going to put the pad or at least a T-shirt.

Wow.

I'm kind of a sporty.

All right.

Put a T-shirt on.

You want me to put on some shorts?

No, you're going to be Winnie the Pooh-ing it.

Okay.

Great.

All right.

Here we go.

Ready?

Right.

Here.

Right.

Here we go.

Yeah.

I have a pretty short wind up, if that's okay.

I'm like a velociraptor with my tiny arms.

That's what I do.

All right.

Ready?

That's a T-rex.

All right.

Here we go.

And...

You...

I'm going to give you another shot.

Oh, you will?

Yeah.

Oh, and one.

How about a gun?

We fire gun.

Yeah.

Johnny Knoxville style.

Oh, God.

I don't know.

What's in it?

Is it bullets or beanbags?

They're actually hard balls.

Yeah.

We have a baseball gun here in this studio.

Let's do it.

Absolutely.

All right.

Here we go.

Ready?

Oh, God!

Ah!

Pounced off my clavicle into my neck.

Into your neck.

Into my neck.

I have a very sharp clavicle bounce straight up.

Oh, my gosh.

You need any help?

No, let's keep going with the show.

Okay.

So what are we, Owen?

No, we're one and one.

We're one and...

No, we're two and one.

We're two and one.

Two and one.

Thank you.

Okay.

God, I feel like we haven't talked about any of your...

My coaching, my skills.

Yeah.

Which is what you came on here to talk about.

Well, it's mostly telling people how to yell or be quiet based on the ball or the strike.

That's just it.

What about the strike zone?

Nothing about that.

It depends on the height of the guy.

The height of the guy, it's between his knees and his numbers.

Yeah, we know all this.

Well, if not everybody does.

Yeah, but if you want to be an ump, a presumably...

You don't just walk into a class and say, we know all this.

Then don't take the class.

But no, no, what you're saying is like...

I'm trying to have other implications.

You're teaching astronaut class and you're like, hey everyone, we're going to space.

Yeah, that's the first thing they'd probably say.

I bet.

You want me to get into the deep stuff, Scott?

Yes, Donald ump.

Okay.

First of all, what a nightmare that that guy was born after me.

You know what I mean?

What guy?

Donald Trump.

Oh, okay.

Horrible.

Yeah.

Got that part.

No.

Just got that part.

No.

Come on, if the joke doesn't work, cut it.

I'm not going to cut anything.

Our editing machine is broken.

You know that.

True or false.

I had my neck replaced.

You're stroking it right now.

I'm going to say false.

I'm kidding.

Get to the deep stuff.

The deep stuff is...

What's the scandal?

You got to respect the players.

Because the players have bats.

They got balls.

They have balls that have balls that have balls.

They make them a lot more money.

Yeah.

And so they don't really like it.

They don't like us, first of all.

We're sort of against each other.

No one ever says thanks for the good call.

It's so interesting because normally when you go to a baseball game, it's like one team versus another team, but it's really both teams versus the umpires.

Exactly.

Do they allow you to be friends with any players?

Because I would think there'd be preferential treatment if you're a good friend with a batter.

Right.

If like, we go to your Instagram and you're like there with, you know.

Yeah.

They do allow it.

It's just never come up.

They're really not interested.

I'm definitely trying to hang with the players, trying to get drinks, trying to get seeds.

So if you do have a friend that's batting, you, if it's a strike, sometimes you call a ball, right?

Oh, yeah.

But you've just never made friends with anyone.

Yeah.

I'll do it.

I call a lot of balls to try to get these feathers to be my friends, but it's not taken.

Are you known as the ball collar?

The ball collar.

Yeah.

Yeah, absolutely.

Well, and they said you're a horrible umpire, but you're a great umpire teacher.

You clearly know all the rules.

Kevin, what is going on with you?

No, I was just going to say I used to play baseball.

Are you the most tired person alive?

What is going on?

You know, some people work hard.

And what about you, though?

I sleep a lot.

Okay.

You know, I don't sleep that well, but that's another story.

Yeah.

Let's get back to the umpire.

You should start sleeping on your non-replace side.

If I had one of those chest plates they wear, yeah, I would sleep like a baby.

Yeah.

Just ride on your stomach.

It's like one of those heavy blankets.

Yeah.

You're familiar with those?

Yeah, I have one myself.

Yeah.

Take it easy.

Yeah, I don't mean to brag, but I have that kind of money.

I sleep with a mask on the big wide pants, the funny shoes.

Oh, you sleep the whole outfit on that night?

Yeah.

Because you're ready to go.

This is my outfit.

Do you get calls in the middle of the night like a doctor where you suddenly have to umpire a game at 3 a.

I give calls in the middle of the night in my sleep.

I'm calling strikes and balls all night long.

And if I ever call you in the middle night, go follow a strike, ball a strike.

Yes.

They do.

And you don't even know what it is.

I didn't know what they're talking about, but I'll call it, though.

Believe me.

Have you ever been in the act of lovemaking and you've missed and called a ball?

What was the second ball?

Oh, yeah.

No, I have never been in the act of lovemaking.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Okay.

Really.

So you're a, you still have your V card is a polite way of saying it.

I have been trying to get the card, but I can't find that.

I went to the library.

You're a member of 10 15.

Yeah.

You should get your V card.

I show everybody my tattoo.

Oh my gosh.

You have a tattoo?

Yeah.

What's it say?

Strike.

What's this pen 15?

So you get, you literally got the tattoo from the person who wrote it on your arm.

You went straight to a tattoo bar.

Yeah.

Well, I went to school with a bunch of tattoo artists.

Oh, you did?

Yeah.

Were they the youngest tattoo artists in the city?

In the city, not the world, but in the city.

Yeah.

They were nine, 10.

I saw somebody with a tattoo on their shoulder and said, no regrets.

This seems like a joke from your act.

No, it's true.

It was a true story.

No, no, no, no.

You should put it in your act.

No, no, no, I don't do it.

I don't play that way.

If you see something in real life, you don't put it in your act.

I make everything up.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, Donald, is there more to talk to you about?

I don't think so.

Okay, great.

Let's take a break.

Let's call this game.

Yeah, let's call it.

All right, we're going to take a break.

When we come back, we'll have more Kevin Nealon.

We'll have more Donald up and we have an attorney coming up.

Oh, do you need any legal work?

No.

Okay, good.

Good for you.

All right.

Well, I do certainly.

So we'll be talking to them about that.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

We're back with Kevin Nealon.

The book is I robot.

No, I exaggerate.

Please don't joke about I exaggerate this Christmas.

It's called I exaggerate my brushes with fame.

It's a great gift.

My brushes with fame.

Yeah, it's a lot of caricatures in there that I've done.

You say it's a great gift, but like people can still buy it for themselves, right?

They don't have to wait around for one of their friends to get the hint.

They can give themselves as well.

Yeah.

And that's I'm really quite proud of it, to be honest with you.

Are you really?

What are you most proud of in your career?

Let's just talk career, not family or anything like that.

Aside from this book?

No, put your book, rank this book in terms of everyone.

The book is number one.

Yeah.

What about grownups?

No, I don't care about them.

That's right.

We said we weren't going to talk about your family.

That's right.

This comes before anything else in my life.

Anything else?

Yeah.

Okay.

So let's talk about family.

Is this before you're more proud of this than your family?

Way, way, way, way, way, way before.

So this is the culminating achievement of your life.

Well, I don't want to call it culminating because there's things that's called culminating.

There might be something happening.

Yeah, there might be something happening.

But up to this point, I would say this is probably the best work I've ever done.

And this is aside from all of my cancer research, all of my...

You are this close to curing it, aren't you?

Yes, but they didn't give me the amount of money I was asking for.

So we kind of scrapped that whole project.

Yeah, yeah.

You just walked away.

But you know, as I look through this book now, it's got a nice weight and feel to it.

My picture's on the cover.

How many pages?

Yellow.

Yeah, a lot.

210, maybe?

No, it's got to be more than that.

Wow.

Look at this.

Robert Plant.

Yeah.

That is Robert Plant.

Yeah, yeah.

Old Robert Plant, too.

There's Romy Malek.

There's Jennifer Epstein.

Yeah.

I'm still looking for a page count.

Okay.

Go to the back.

That's usually the way we do it.

It is two.

We don't count.

With the acknowledgments?

Yeah.

Every in the notes.

It is...

It's got to be divisible by 16.

223.

That's what I'd say.

All right.

224 the back page, but it's not numbered.

Yeah.

224.

Let me make sure that's divisible by 16.

We'll see if we got an accurate count here.

Let's see.

224 divided by 16.

Yeah.

Exactly.

224 pages.

Do you know that is?

That is Lauren Michaels himself.

Yeah.

You're right.

Yes.

That's right.

Do you remember the day?

I believe I've asked you this on the show before.

There's Chris Rock.

Mm-hmm.

The day that he took you out to the IV or whatever and said, Kevin, you're part of the shoe.

No.

I'll call in you up to the shoe.

No, I'll tell you what he did say though.

Right before I went out to do my first sketch, it was called Mistress Subliminal.

Yes.

I love that sketch.

Thanks.

It was kind of a tricky sketch because there were like two conversations going on at once.

And you had to memorize all the lines too.

Yeah.

Memorize them all.

Yeah.

Or maybe 10 seconds away from coming back from the commercial.

I'm standing there waiting to go on it for my very first live television performance on SNL, standing in the same stage Belushi stood on as live.

They're coming back 10 seconds.

And then I'm sitting there and I'm sitting there.

I'm sitting there waiting for the show to go on.

But I'll tell you what, some of his best writing has been on birthday cards.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

They really, him and his staff really research, they know what you like.

Like he knew I like skiing.

So for a gift, I like birthday I see every skis.

Oh, wow.

But the card is always the most.

It's so like, it's like an index card, you know, kind of a manila looking hard.

And then his name is engraved on the top.

And then he types, you know, or something types as message.

It's always really clever and fun.

Does he give you something?

If you've been on the show, does he give you something every year for the rest of your life or is it just like while you're there?

Why you're there?

That's the problem.

So when you leave, you win.

That's why you did so many years, right?

Yeah, that's the only reason.

But I didn't know when I left, I was waiting on my birthday for the gift.

And nothing can be.

Where are my new skis?

Because you wear out your skis every year, don't you?

I do.

I wear them out.

I go to like four or five a year.

Five skis usually.

Right.

And he would know that.

He would give you a new one for the, you were on 10 years, is that right?

Nine years.

So nine pair of skis, 18 skis.

No, 17.

Did he miss a ski once?

No, no, I slalom once in a while.

Oh, okay.

So he just gave you one one year.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You might have been a snowboard, I'm not sure.

Mmm.

That's a fast ski.

Yeah, the gifts are really great.

But when I left the show, it gave me this beautiful Cartier watch.

Really?

And you're right on the back.

Because you had been there the longest at that point.

Yeah, out of anyone.

Now, of course, you've been eclipsed by Keenan and other people.

Yeah, everyone.

Yeah, everyone stays there.

People realize what a gig that is.

Yeah, exactly.

Why leave?

I knew it was a great gig because I never expected to be there in the first place.

The only problem with it is staying up so late on Saturdays.

Well, it's taped.

So you don't have to stay up.

It is taped?

Yeah, it's always not new.

I knew it.

Yeah.

I knew it.

A lot of people ask me, they go, when do you tape that show?

I say, well, it's in the afternoon and Saturday.

Well, we also have Donald Ump here, who is an umpire coach.

And do you want to talk as long as Kevin just did?

Steve, right!

Because we have to get to our next guest.

He's an attorney.

He's been on the show before.

And he's an 11-year-old boy.

Please welcome back to the show, Robbie Del Muda.

Scott, thanks for having me back.

It's a pleasure to be here.

So good to see you again, Robbie.

This is Kevin Neeland.

Hi, Kevin.

Do you know who Kevin Neeland is?

I mean, you probably, who's the earliest SNL cast that you would know about 11 years old?

I mean...

Yeah, the earliest one that I know is, I caught the tail end of Daryl Hammond.

How?

Yeah, I didn't know he did.

He did a nice tail end.

He had a long run.

Do you mean the tail end of him announcing the show?

Taking Don Pardos?

Yeah, that's what I meant.

Why?

Do you do something else?

Hi, Robbie.

This is Donald Ump as well.

He's an umpire coach.

Hi, Donald.

Hey, Robbie.

Good to see you too.

What's going on?

Last time you were here, you remind us about what you...

Scott, last time I was here, I was in a bit of a bind.

I was in court representing myself for...

I was in there for embezzlement.

And I got some news for you, Scott.

I'm back in court.

No!

For the same thing?

No!

Tax evasion.

Yeah.

I'm being forced to represent myself.

Will you have a fool for a client?

Oh, Scott, please.

What happened?

Robbie, tell us what happened.

Scott, I'm being framed.

Once again, I'm being framed by granite investments.

Oh, that's right.

Last time you were on the show, they had framed you somehow?

They framed me.

They caught...

They said that I was embezzling and they used my basketball card collecting as an excuse, as to how it was being done.

And now I'm being caught, I'm being framed for tax evasion.

Tax evasion.

Is it related to the embezzlement?

It's unrelated to the embezzlement.

This is the fresh new charge and I'm in over my head.

Oh my God.

Have you ever been...

Kevin, have you ever been framed for something that you've had to go into court?

Nothing there wasn't a picture, man.

It was all on the up and up.

Scott, it's scary.

Kevin, consider yourself lucky, okay?

Because it is a true nightmare.

Not to mention, I'm back in night court.

That's where I have to go.

That's because you go to school during the day.

I go to school during the day, I'm in fifth grade.

So you have to go to night court.

It's a juggling act, Scott.

Have you ever been in court, Donald?

Yeah, unfortunately, yeah.

For what?

Well, J-walking.

You had to go to court for J-walking?

Usually that's just something you pay a fine and...

No, I didn't want to pay.

Oh, really?

So you were...

I was contesting it.

Oh, okay.

And did you do it?

I got caught.

This was good to happen.

It happened while you were J-walking in that crosswalk.

You committed some kind of a crime, didn't you?

Well, yeah.

I had to go to the bathroom.

I pulled down my pants.

You shouldn't drop us over there.

You should have trouble throwing me an exposure.

But J-walking is what I thought it was for.

I mean, is it in decent exposure if it's just your butt?

That's what I said.

You know what I mean?

To me, it's funny exposure.

Funny, just a butt.

Nothing's wrong with a butt.

But funny, huh?

But funny.

I draw a lot of them in my biology book.

Yeah.

That's where they belong.

That's where I'm concerned.

Hey, Don, did you have a lawyer?

How did you get out of it?

I did.

I had a pro bono lawyer.

Bro, what?

Who?

Pro bono.

It's a freer that they provide.

If you're a lawyer, you got to know terms like pro bono.

Scott, I'm learning on the fly here, okay?

I'm holding on by the seat of my pants.

It sounds like you are a pro bono lawyer to yourself.

Oh, yeah.

I haven't been charging me on this one lately.

I can't afford my services, so I'm doing a pro bono.

So you're in court right now.

Who is, is it the state against you?

Is that the- It's a state that's against me.

They say that I've been evading taxes, and again, granite investment is the one that's framing me.

Do you even work?

I mean, you- how are you- They're not even supposed to pay taxes, are you?

They say that I do.

My dad, who, as you know, runs granite investments.

Oh, that's right.

He said that I'm on the payroll.

He said that I'm an employee there.

All right.

Which I did not think that I was, nor do I do any work for them, which is what I'm trying to tell everybody, but he says that I have been in account for them, and I have been cooking the books.

So there's two sets of books.

There's two of them.

There's honestly, there's too many books.

I got no books for school.

I can't handle this many books.

That's a good joke right there.

It's a good piece of business.

I'll be honest.

Have you ever thought about asking your dad not to sue you or turn you into the police?

I ask him it every time, and then they say objection, and then the judges say- Oh, you do it in court.

You gotta do it at home.

Where?

Home.

Oh, yeah.

I'm in court school, then I gotta go to court.

Are you afraid of going to prison?

They're definitely afraid.

Yeah.

You didn't go to prison for your last thing.

How did- No.

It catches up.

How did that end?

Oh, let's see.

With the embezzling?

Yeah.

Oh, they ended up throwing it out of court.

They did.

Wow.

Yes.

Oh, they said- they said I was rambling in the court, and then the judge got a little tired.

You can just- you can get your case throwing out just for rambling?

Yeah.

I started rambling, and then they're like, what is this kid even talking about?

He can't handle prison.

We gotta get him out of here.

Wow.

Yeah.

So then they said, you get out of here, kid, but you gotta do- you know what?

You gotta get- you gotta get- you gotta get A's in school.

That was my punishment.

Oh, okay.

That was your community work?

Yeah, that was my community work.

I did not do it.

I've been struggling in school.

Oh, okay.

I don't even know if I'm going to pass the fifth grade.

Well, yeah.

I mean, you're spending your nights instead of studying.

You're spending your nights in court again.

Yeah.

This sounds like your dad is trying to frame you with something that he's done.

Yes.

That's exactly- Scott, please.

Would you be my lawyer?

He's been funneling money.

Would I be your lawyer?

I'm not a lawyer.

Well, neither am I.

Did you pass the bar, though?

No, on the way there.

Yeah.

But I'm not allowed in too young.

It sounds like your dad has been funneling money from his company into some sort of slush fund, maybe offshore drilling accounts or something like that.

Slush fund?

I see fund.

I don't know which one that is.

All I know is good because you're a child.

Yes.

Sorry.

We shouldn't forget that.

What are your friends?

Your best friends say about this?

Look, everyone's preoccupied with the dance that's coming up.

Okay.

So they don't even have time to talk to me about this stuff.

A dance at 11 years old?

Yeah.

We have a dance in the fifth grade.

And you know what?

Sixth grade is unvited and I have a crush and I want to dance with us so bad.

Oh, who is this?

Or- Deanna Bermuda.

Deanna Bermuda.

Yeah.

She's something else special about her.

Oh, I tell you what.

She's got hair that when the light hits it just right, it looks like amber waves of grain.

You haven't even- she's got hair.

Yeah.

Sweet.

That's a step up.

So if you guys got married, she would be Amber Bermuda DelMuda.

Yeah.

She said, if we get married, there's no way I'm just taking your name.

We're hyphenating at minimal.

She already is talking marriage with you.

She said, if I do, because I've asked them many times and she said, if I did, it would have to be hyphenated.

Now beat it.

All right.

You take you and your chocolate milk, get out of here.

Have you ever had your heart broken by someone?

Uh, yes.

I've had my heart broken.

My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Bunker.

All right.

I had a crush on her and I said, I love you so much.

And she said, you're too young for me.

I'm a teacher.

You got to get out of here.

But too young for me part, that's not what I would lead with.

I would say it's an inappropriate relationship.

I'm your teacher.

Oh, also you're young.

Okay.

Well, I mean, she's, I guess she's, she doesn't want to say that, but she's paraphrasing Scott.

Okay.

I got to sit around and listen to that whole spiel.

I got a recess to get to Scott.

What do you do during recess?

I play kickball.

I watch kickball.

I talk it about it.

I watch it.

I was going to say you don't seem like a kickball player.

I like to look at it.

I like to see it from a distance.

What do you like about it?

Just the aesthetic?

I like to watch the ball going through the air.

I like to see it and catch it.

Sometimes they don't.

Either way, I like the effort.

As long as they're making an effort, I'm happy.

Scott, here's the problem.

Yes, Sienna.

Man, I would love to go on it.

I would love to dance with so much at the game.

You've already asked her to marry you.

It's like just dancing, you know, wouldn't be that far.

Yeah, she rejected that so I pulled back a little bit.

I said, you know, if you can just dance, but here's the problem.

She likes a strong silent type.

Oh, no.

Yeah.

And I'm weak and loud.

How much can you lift?

Look around the room.

Is there anything that you could lift or could not lift?

Is that a full bag of lace or some of it been eaten?

Some of it looks like about approximately a third of it has been eaten.

Okay, then I got a shot.

What you're looking at would be loud.

It would be loud lifting.

It would be loud lifting because you're not a silent.

No, yeah, I'd be real loud.

I'm a bit of a showman, Kevin.

I've got people to notice.

I like people to watch.

You're a show boater.

I'm a show boater.

I like to see.

I like people to see what I'm doing.

I like them to talk about it.

And then maybe they can come on to court and be a character witness.

This guy's pretty fun.

He's a strong guy and he's innocent.

He's not been doing evasion of taxes.

So to sum you up, you're a loud, weak show boater.

What?

What are you saying?

What?

I don't differ when you're saying that for so when I'm saying it.

You're a loud, weak show boater who's representing himself in court for embezzlement.

That's the gist of it, Scott.

Why do you sound like a 50-year-old from New Jersey?

The last time you were on the show, people were like, he's got such a deep voice for an 11-year-old.

Yeah.

And again, I'm just trying to sound older.

Okay, I'm trying to sound mature.

Wait, so this is what's your real voice like?

My real voice?

Yeah.

Hey, Scott.

Do you see why I'm having problems with the ana?

I thought you couldn't say your Rs because you were a kid, but it's more of just a regional accent that you're trying to find.

I'm from Cedar Grove, Wisconsin, but I think let's bring it to the East Coast.

They seem smart, all right.

But you?

Yeah, to me.

I suppose people don't seem smart to be.

You don't think so?

Is it Harvard in the East Coast?

Well, somewhere.

Yeah, that's true.

Where's Columbia?

Where is Columbia?

Scott, it's a test.

I have a test coming up.

I need to know.

Is it a test on where Columbia is?

Yeah, they say where the Ivy League schools.

I don't know where all of them are.

But what are them in the South America, obviously?

Yeah.

Whoa, oh, yeah.

If you just put that down on the test, it's like a trick question they can't give you.

I can barely keep my eyes open in school anymore, all right.

I'm so tired from Night Court.

You're like Kevin on this show.

Yes, exactly.

I thought Kevin and I were kindred spirits.

Dear Lord, I could use your help in court.

Kevin, please.

Kevin, do you want to represent Robbie over here in court?

I'd be happy to.

Really?

You have the most lawyerly energy out of the three of us, I would say.

Thank you.

Yeah, I mean, you know, it's not an easy job.

And you got to look over your client, first of all, or your potential client and make sure that this person is not guilty.

Yeah, because you really want to believe in your client, right?

You don't want to defend someone who you know is guilty.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah.

So what do you think?

Is this guy guilty?

Robbie, this poor little defenseless boy with an affect effect.

He's coast tax and of a 50 year old man.

You know, one of the good sides of the lawyer is one of the characteristic traits of listening.

So I listen very closely.

Rob, when were you accused of shoplifting?

When did that happen?

Shoplifting?

Yeah, you said shoplifting, right?

No, tax evasion.

Or tax evasion.

Oh, yeah.

Kevin, no.

Okay.

Yeah.

You really should have listened to this.

I had the shoplifting.

I'd only do shoplifting.

Oh, you, who have you represented in shoplifting?

Oh my God.

You're going on a rider?

You're famously.

That's right.

Marlon Brando.

He was a shoplifter.

Big shoplifter.

Oh, was he stuffing things in his cheeks?

It is cheeks.

That's all he got out.

Even by doing the impression.

Okay.

So let's, let's recap.

Okay.

Pre-cap.

When on a rider?

Marlon Brando.

And get this one.

You'll never believe this one.

Mm.

And then be just.

What?

Can you prosecute an ex-president?

Yes, you can.

Wow, that was the first time it's ever happened.

Well, he wasn't an ex-president of the time.

Oh, he was pre-president.

Yeah.

It was a cold case.

So we had to go back in time a little bit.

Kevin, I've never heard of any of these people.

It's all made up.

I'm making them look actually.

Okay.

But that's what we do in court.

You know, it's a whole like.

You just make stuff up in court.

It's a training.

It's part of your training.

Yeah, yeah.

A lot of times you don't know what you're talking about.

Being a lawyer is like being a.

It's got the whole time.

Kevin, the whole time I don't know what I'm talking about.

Yeah, you called him Scott.

Yeah, sorry, Scott, I'm sorry.

We're good lawyers.

I should know Matt.

We're not friends by the way.

You've done just showed twice.

Kevin Scott.

Hey, come on, man.

I think I considered us pretty close.

I don't think we're close.

I barely know you.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, hey, we dance needs chaperones.

That's my friend.

That's the thing maybe the three of us could do.

Oh, I could do that.

I'll throw people out of there.

Yeah, please.

Just get rid of, get you guys get rid of Dean.

You got to get rid of Dean Oxton.

Oh, I love you too.

That must be confusing because if you're at school and someone's like, hey, Dean is here.

Usually the deans are in charge.

Dean, recap, Dean is my bully, but he's also the dean.

Oh, that's right.

We talked about this.

Yeah.

You got to get rid of him.

So I'm saying the same thing I said on the previous episode.

Yeah, but it's true.

We all need to remind the Scott.

Rob, what's your fantasy?

My fantasy?

Good question.

I'll tell you what, not being in prison.

Number one fantasy.

I'm going to lead off with that.

Second fantasy.

I would like to be in a room that's full of cotton candy, okay?

And I have limited quarters for the video games.

But does the room have video games in it?

No.

Just cotton candy and colors.

No.

This is frustrating fantasy.

It's kind of an escape room.

You got to get out of this room to get into the room with the video games.

You ever see that a video of the squirrel and the cotton candy and trying to wash it off and it just dissolves and disintegrates?

Oh, sounds like a tale of death.

No, I've never seen it.

Oh, okay.

I apologize for bringing it up.

Well, look, yeah, we could be chaperones.

You'd be throwing people out.

Absolutely.

Kids allowed to put their hands on other kids' butts or why are you putting my glasses on?

You're trying to read some of the names on the table?

But your visit's pretty good.

I don't need these.

Yes, I do.

That's why I wear them.

We could be chaperones for you though.

What night is the dance?

It's coming up.

It's Friday night.

It's right at the school.

It's still daylight.

It's still daylight?

Yeah.

So like right after school, 330 or so?

330.

It's at the school.

This Friday?

This Friday.

But you've got to fly out to see the rule of Wisconsin.

That's where I go to school.

Is this a Halloween dance, by the way?

It's a Halloween dance.

Okay.

We're having it a bit early.

October is too spooky.

Well, this is the 29th of October.

What?

Yes.

Oh, yes.

Of course.

The scariest one.

I know a date is Scott, please.

I'm going to go every day.

I've got to talk about dates all the time.

Okay?

I mean, it's no April, but it's a pretty scary month.

We'll make you a deal.

We'll chaperone your dance.

Yeah.

As long as we don't have to represent unicorn.

It's like a plea deal and I'll take it.

All right.

Are you going to plea down?

I'm going to I've been pleading since I got that.

Please stop this.

This is a sanity.

Okay.

Please.

Maybe you should just ramble on again because it seems like that got you out of the.

I ran out of topics.

All right.

I have an exhaust that it's the same judge.

He's like, I heard all this before I don't want to hear it again.

And I'm like, I don't want to repeat myself.

So I got to come up with some fresh topics.

So I've been scouring the news.

This is not what a lawyer does.

I'm going to come up with topics.

I got some hot topics.

I got some conversation bits and for current events.

Yeah.

From the month of October from the month of October, I've got some current events.

I just want to know.

I say I asked the jury.

I asked some of the people that are in the back and then I try to talk to the.

Me I'm the defendant.

I talked to the plaintiff.

So you know the terms.

Hey, I'm being I'm getting up the speed here.

Scott.

Okay.

My dad is there.

All right.

He's against me on this one.

Yeah.

I asked him any questions.

Why is he doing this?

Get him on the stand.

I asked him why are you doing this?

And then he said, you know, he said to me, he said, son, what doesn't kill you?

He just ended it there.

It was the question.

What doesn't kill you?

Yeah.

He's asking you.

Yeah.

Sounds like a riddle.

He wants to know.

Is he trying to find out what does kill you?

I don't worry about that's what I'm worried about.

Scott.

All right.

Because it's a longer list.

I would say feathers.

No, I'm grass.

But feathers will kill you.

Are you allergic to feathers?

Yeah.

You have a bird allergy?

I have a bird allergy.

Yeah.

Do you know, remember in Jurassic Park three when they go into the aviary?

I do.

Yeah.

I couldn't handle that part.

I had to turn it off.

Yeah.

And now they say dinosaurs have feathers on them nowadays.

What?

Yeah.

So if you see the latest Jurassic world suddenly like there's big feathers on these dinosaurs.

Don't know.

Spoila.

Scott, please.

He's been out for now for three months.

It has.

I've been embroiled in a court case.

I don't have time to go to the cinema.

Also I think you can watch a movie with birds in it if you have allergies.

You don't have to turn it off.

Yeah.

You're not watching a movie next to birds.

Well, I'm itching.

I'm itching when I'm watching.

Kevin's putting his book away.

He's mentally done.

No, no, no, this is the cover for the book.

I don't want to think it's dirty.

You don't want to think it's dirty, of course.

No, I think this is my, what do they call it, the attach a case when I go to court?

Oh, it is.

Oh, okay.

So you're thinking about representing him at this point?

No, I'm not thinking about it.

He's already signed a contract.

Yes.

Yeah.

You realize he's not a shoplifter.

He's not a shoplifter, not at all.

He's nothing.

Well, that's not saying that to Kevin.

Where are you?

The soldier.

Yeah.

I am something.

Okay.

So you have a representative over here.

I've got three shadatives.

I got a possible dance with Dan the Bermuda and things are looking up.

I'm looking really good.

I'm feeling good keeping the bright side.

I like it.

Yes.

All right.

Good.

Yeah, things are looking up for Robbie Delmuda.

It's worth traveling out here.

Why did you come all the way out here just to be on this show?

My friends.

God, I haven't seen you in a while.

We're not friends.

We're friends.

Oh, we're not friends.

Kevin and I have known each other a long time.

We're barely friends.

Right.

I don't know if there's a chemistry.

I'm not even in his book.

You've never drawn me.

Well, you have drawn me.

You're in three different pages.

I'm on three pages.

Thank you so much.

By the book he'll see.

Okay.

You're on three pages.

Is that your commitment to every reader?

You'll be on three pages if you buy the book.

Yeah.

Now you've taken off your headphones and you're just unraveling the chords.

No, I'm not unraveling it.

I'm making a little days of change.

What'd you say?

I was asking, where can I find your book?

Oh, it's right here in my bag.

Oh, there it is.

It's hard to find when you put it in the bag.

Yeah, and that's it.

No, it'll be at every book store.

You buy books, you know?

You've been to a bookstore, right?

You know how to read.

You're an 11 year old.

I'm an 11 year old.

Haven't been to a bookstore.

We don't got a lot of those around anymore.

Scott.

All right.

There's not many left.

There's a lot of...

The big box stores, you know?

The big box chains are putting them out of business.

Is that what you're trying to say?

Yeah.

They've been...

I do have one last time you've seen a Walden books.

The 90s.

Yeah.

How do you know what a Walden book is?

I've read the archives.

The archives.

What archives?

Oh, my dad keeps on, you know, down in the cellar.

Your dad is keeping archives of old bookstores?

Yeah.

Okay, your dad seems like a real...

First of all, he's a criminal.

Yes.

Kevin, remember that.

I remember that.

Yeah.

That's a quote from me.

Leave with that.

That's a pull quote for your tribe.

Yeah, yeah.

Scott, you could have been a lawyer if you wanted.

You're...

I couldn't.

You're on the up and up.

I could.

I'm on the ball.

All right.

Look.

Hey, that is a daisy chain.

It's a daisy chain.

It truly is.

Wow.

We're running out of time.

Kevin's running out of patience.

I ran out of time a long time ago.

Yeah, I feel that for people.

I'm also running out of time.

We only have time for one final feature, and that's a little something called plugs.

All right.

I'm going to be a little bit more.

You show a way in and out.

And I'll come while you walk.

I'll come while you walk.

I hope there's more.

There it is.

That was tug while you plug by Evan Ezer Scrooge who was speaking of scary stuff.

Hey, I just pictured myself me and Dandabramuda dancing to that song.

Yeah.

It was magical.

Yeah.

Went on a little too long for a dance as far as I'm concerned.

As far as I'm concerned.

I'm going to be a vlog scene.

All right, Kevin, you want to talk about your book, right?

Have we discussed it at all?

I don't want to read the whole book.

Oh, yeah, yeah, please.

Maybe there's not enough time for that.

Yeah.

This week.

I exaggerate my brush with fame.

And if you're looking for it in the Library of Congress, you would go to it.

Smithsonian usually will have it.

Yeah.

The Library of Congress does carry it online.

But at any bookstore, any bookstore, and you would look for it under Neelen Kama Kevin, right?

Yeah.

You owe the name first.

Yeah.

And it's also you'll recognize my picture on the front.

What section in the library?

It would be probably under best books.

Yeah.

That's actually the library.

It's just best books.

I think so.

Okay.

Interesting.

That's books out by the front door.

All right.

Donald up.

What do you want to plug?

Well, I'm striking out on tour.

Going to the Midwest, the East Coast.

That's a funny joke.

I mean, you're striking out on tour.

The third word isn't a baseball.

Yeah.

Tour.

But what else can you say?

Yeah.

Check out Big Grand Day on tour.

We're going around.

Me and other umpires.

We're all going to be dressed as umpires doing calls.

Okay.

Interesting.

And this is the end of this month.

End of this month, September, November, October, November.

Excuse me.

Yeah.

Okay.

Incredible.

And Robbie Dilmuda, what do you want to plug?

Let's see here.

You can check out the four episode podcast, Moonshine Land.

Where we like to get podcasts.

Four episodes.

You're a manageable number as opposed to this show, which is 780 at this point.

It's unwieldy, Scott.

Okay.

And I want to plug, obviously, head over to CBB World if you want to hear the archives.

If you want to hear Kevin's previous episodes, his episode number two, as well as the last time you were on the show a couple years ago.

I've got to mention this book is also on Audible Books.

Oh, it is.

How do you read caricatures?

Well, like I said, it's adjoining anecdotes, anecdotes.

Yeah.

But do you like describe the caricatures?

Yeah.

You're like, okay.

So this looks like prints, obviously.

But...

No, no, we have PDFs that people will look at.

Oh, really?

Yeah, true thing.

So they look at the PDF while they're driving.

If they want to.

Yeah.

If they can take a break from their phone call.

Yeah.

Okay.

What do I want to plug?

The Comedy Bang Bang book coming in April of 2023 next year.

You can pre-order it now at your favorite booksellers and head over to CBBWorld.com.book for more info on that.

All the links are there, including links to the autographed editions, which I'm signing.

We have CBB Presents.

So many good stuff over there.

Scott hasn't seen.

Also ad-free episodes of Three Them in the Archives.

All right.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

Take one hand, put it up.

Take the other bullet down.

You're gonna make a life.

It's not too short to close it.

But don't close it too much.

You're hoping.

And when you open up that plug bag.

When you open up that plug bag, when you open up your heart for the rest of the world.

I'm talking open up the plug bag.

I hope you're not a plug bag.
