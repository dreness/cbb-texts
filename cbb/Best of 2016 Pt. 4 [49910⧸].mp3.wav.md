♪♪♪ Don't tell me to get my shit together.

What do you take me for a dung beetle?

Oh, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Who was that?

That was Elvis Cholesterol Stellow.

What?

Elvis Cholesterol Stellow.

I may have just wanted to say Elvis Cholesterol Stellow.

I don't know that I like the catchphrase.

How does it feel now that you said it?

Not good.

I kind of lost my way in the middle of it.

But hey, I brought it all back at the end.

You sure did.

I sure did.

Yes.

Welcome to the show Comedy Bang Bang 4.

This is our fourth of four best of episodes, a yearly tradition that I would not do without.

Could not do without.

No, I would not do without.

If we didn't do these episodes, I would not do these episodes.

I feel much the same.

Scott Ockerman here, and we're coming up on New Year's Eve in a few days.

So that's exciting.

A New Year.

Maybe this year will be different.

Different than what?

Different than last year was this past year.

Maybe.

Probably be worse.

Probably.

Who knows?

Look, there's a lot of joy to be had in life, and we hope that we're a part of that if you enjoy the show.

It's right there in the title.

Enjoy.

Joy.

Wait, what?

Joy is right there in enjoy.

Oh, and you consider words titles.

Exactly.

When they had to come up with a title for that feeling, it's a title.

Yeah, it's a word.

That's the title.

This is sound logic.

You know what I'm saying?

I do know what you're saying.

Language is all about communication.

So if you know what I'm saying, then I've done my job.

Now, Laurie Anderson famously talks saying that language is a virus from outer space.

Oh, Superman?

Yes, the same.

Okay.

She said language is a virus from outer space.

Do you think that's true?

A virus from outer space.

You know, it is, I do have to say, it's a little weird that there's so many different languages.

Right?

You know what I mean?

It's impractical.

It really is because you go to these different countries and it's so easy to get to countries now.

You just like hop on a little puddle joker.

You hop on your private plane.

You go right over there.

Right.

And then you get off the plane and suddenly everyone speaking a different language is like, whoa, whoa, slow your roll.

Stay in your lane.

But if you could only speak one language, which one would it be?

Because I'm not convinced it's English.

English is not the most pleasant sounding language.

This is the thing.

I think we need to vote on what the prettiest language is.

Someone say the romance languages are pretty, but at the same time, do they have enough in them?

And this is really a question for linguists and cunning linguists.

I think I get what you're saying.

Yeah.

Are the romance languages like Italian and Spanish, are there enough words in them to be poetic?

Because English has so many words.

So many words.

We took words from other languages.

Oh, yeah.

And we just adapt them.

So there's so many different ways to say things.

Now, I would say that people who speak English don't use a lot of them, including myself.

And I don't even know how to pronounce half of them.

No, you're terrible.

Yes.

And I think that you have a learning disability.

I'm definitely not learning anything new.

I say we go back to basics and we do Greek or Latin.

Greek or Latin.

Everybody speaks.

But what about Chinese?

Too hard.

It's hard, but is it not rewarding?

And it's not fair.

Just because the majority of people are Chinese right now, then we're supposed to all do that.

But look, look, look, I'm not saying that we all have to learn it.

I'm saying that we, this is an alternate universe where just click everyone speaks it.

What is the most pleasurable to speak?

Is it Chinese?

I don't know that.

It's pleasurable to speak.

It's not the most pleasurable I can listen to.

I don't know.

But maybe they love it.

When you understand it, maybe it's like, oh my God, how beautiful that sounds.

So they would say the romance languages would be because they're so...

Bonjour!

No, you know, there's just so wonderful to listen to.

Italian, I think, is an easy language to speak and also sounds very nice.

It sounds very...

La rio reo reo reo reo reo reo...

What do you mean?

Fine line.

Porky.

I'm Italian, folks.

Love it.

That's what it was before World War II.

Oh, and then a leg of Chinese.

Yeah, we hate them now.

Yeah.

Boy, how things change.

The more things change, the more things stay the same, am I right?

What does that mean?

I hate Italians.

You like Italian food though.

Oh, love it.

Oh, my favorite type of food.

It weren't Italians making it?

But you have American people making your Italian.

Yes, of course.

It's authentic Italian food.

Paul?

Yeah.

New Year's Eve coming up in 2017, right around the corner.

You just wrapped a $1,000,000 property.

We sure did.

We had a great time.

And new seasons of that coming out next year, that's exciting, right?

That's right.

We had a ball.

We had great guest stars.

Our forecast is fantastic.

I got to do more stuff on location this time than I did last season.

The last few seasons you were in the office primarily, mainly due to scheduling or...

These were a scheduling thing.

Limited amount of time.

And also the storylines too just kind of made sense.

And then I got to go out in the world with everybody, which was a lot of fun.

So you got to drive to Malibu.

Got to drive to Malibu for a really long time.

So was it worth it?

Well, that's worth it to be the time.

It was worth it.

I'll say that.

Okay.

I believe you.

It was a blast.

I can't wait to see him.

I know I'm...

Have you seen any of it yet?

I've been seeing it next week.

I will see my first couple of episodes.

I'm very excited by it.

Were you going to direct at one point?

I was.

And then my top secret project, which I believe has been announced already at this point, not at the time of the recording, but at the time of the release.

I believe my top secret project that I co-directed then took up all my time so I could not direct.

Right.

There's mic pants between two fronts.

Mm-hmm.

Mic pants.

I think it's pants every time I hear it.

Like he's so ridiculous.

What if his name was just mic pants and we're supposed to call him...

He's a guy who had a name of pants.

Mic pants.

He's like, Hi, I'm mic pants.

And we were just like, Okay, let's make you vice president.

I think that life is sacred.

My name is mic pants.

That's your in into impersonating it.

I think if you get...

If a woman gets punched in the stomach, she ought to have a funeral for a baby she might have had.

Oh boy, getting political.

Oh no.

You know what though?

We never talk about this stuff.

We never talk about it.

But this, it was very hard not to think about it all the time this year.

Yeah.

Well, you know, so poor us.

Snowflake.

I'm in my safe space with my trigger warnings.

Look, what we're doing is we're counting down.

On this episode, the top three comedy bang bang episodes of the year.

Now all of three like you, me, Pepe the Frog.

My personal top three.

Oh geez.

We also have our top one live episode of the year.

So this is the big stuff.

This is the good stuff.

I hope you are Paul.

I hope you are.

Now, you all voted on your favorite episodes of the year and these are the big ones.

These are the good stuff.

This is what you wanted to hear.

The big ones.

What are you?

You're waggling your eyebrows up and down.

Yeah.

The speed which I have not.

Big ones.

What are you trying to say to me right now?

Am I doing this next thing?

Yes, you're talking about penisites.

Am I?

Yeah.

I don't know.

We're talking about multiple big penises right now.

I don't know what things are.

You don't know what penises are?

Any things.

Can you look down?

I think you have one.

Oh, this money I dropped.

And that cat.

The colax.

Oh, guys, what do you say?

Do you want to get to it?

What do you say, guys?

Let's give them a second.

Volds are in.

Someone said Satan is king.

Did you hear that?

I did not hear that.

Someone said Satan is king.

You didn't hear very clearly on your headphones.

Someone saying Satan is king.

I think that is just something that you're maybe hearing that doesn't exist.

I can't imagine that screw.

Can I ask you a question?

Are you a paranoid schizophrenic?

I mean, define paranoid schizophrenic.

Oh, okay, sure.

A person who has something wrong in their brain where they see and hear things that are not existing in the real world.

Okay, by that definition, I guess so.

Yeah, that's very specific.

So yes, you are one.

Okay, so okay.

Now you're hearing things.

You are hearing Satan's voice commanding you.

What is, I know we got to get to the countdown, but what is real?

Well, not sure that you are.

Oh, I might be a parent.

Because I might be a parent who's a kid.

You're fucking kidding me, that I'm imaginary and I'm a paranoid schizophrenic.

Yeah, this is bullshit.

That's what I've imagined.

It's a lie.

Stop imagining that.

It's a Westworld situation where I need you to have flaws in order to make you more real.

When do I get to wear pants?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, but never.

This is very practical.

I love you in the dress.

I love me in pants.

Let's just compromise it short shorts.

What do you say?

How short are the shorts?

Like up to my waist?

Yeah, no, yeah, they're like hat style.

Call back to John Lennon.

I'll not do another thing.

All right, let's get to it.

This is let's do the top three.

This is your number three.

I like Westworld, by the way.

Number three.

All right, this is number three.

And Paul, we've been talking about how early some of these episodes are from.

Scott, I've noticed it's a recurring theme in this countdown this year.

This is from December 14th of last year.

Is this the earliest one?

No, December 7th was the earliest one.

It was the earliest one.

Never forget.

Yes, never forget.

But this is one week after that one.

This is episode 391, holiday spectacular 2015.

These shows are always nuts.

We just had one last two weeks ago.

That's right.

Well, even more nuts than normal because almost everyone that I asked to do it said yes.

That's right.

I think maybe one person didn't show up, right?

Yeah.

Normally what happens on the holiday ones and the...

Anniversary.

Anniversary is I'll put out a big email to a lot of people who are our favorite guests of the year.

Calling all cars.

And I say, hey, who can show up?

And normally one third of the people can show up.

The one this year, not the one that we're going to hear the clip from, but the one this year everyone said they could and one person did not.

So we had 15 guests.

It was crazy.

It was pretty crazy.

Anyway, but there's some of my favorite episodes of the year.

They're just anything goes and this one is no exception.

This has you, Paul.

Hi.

Lauren Lapkis.

Sure.

John Gabris, Mike Hanford, Neil Campbell and Will Hines.

I mean, that to me sounds good.

Well, it sounds good to me.

That sounds good to me.

Now, obviously, let's address this.

Obviously, a lot of dudes, one woman.

No, I didn't have no idea what you were going to say.

But that's what happens on these large episodes is I put it out to a large group of people and it's whoever can show up at that specific time.

So look, the invites are going out.

That's all I can say.

Yeah, I think that's a good thing to point out about booking.

If you don't know how these things work, no one gets paid for doing podcasts.

It's not like we're sitting there and everyone comes up to us and says, we're always available, put a senior show.

And we can pick from anyone in the world.

Yes.

Yeah, yeah.

It's hard because a lot of times I go through the same thing where I certainly have an idea of who I would like to get for the show for any given episode.

But you don't always get the person that is your first choice for that particular.

Because I think that your show and my show work in similar ways where you make these configurations of people.

You're trying to get a good group that will work together.

Yes, exactly.

And so you have in your mind, oh, I'd love to get these people together at the same time.

But it's very hard to coordinate everybody's schedule.

And also you're dealing with people that are good people who are in demand.

And it's hard to get people to come.

The fact that anyone makes time for this show is very touching to me.

So I appreciate anyone who can show up.

So in any case, this is a great episode.

One of my favorites.

We did it and we were all like, hey, that was really, really good.

And this is the first time that John Gabris got to play in Dren Gino on one of these big episodes.

Oh, really?

He cracked the top three.

This is, I don't believe he was represented on the countdown at all last year.

And I can't remember that.

Yeah.

We did a tribute to him and did a little bit of some of his clips.

And now he's been in the San Diego show and also.

San Diego show.

And also this show and more power to him or white power to him is.

Are we switching that yet?

I don't think it's official yet.

I think it's like late in January.

But okay.

So who do we got?

We got intern Gino and then we have Mike Hanford's playing John Lennon and a lot of strange stuff.

And then we have Lauren Lifekiss is playing Ho Ho the Elf.

And I'm sorry that Lauren could not come back and play Ho Ho at the end of the year this year, but she is in England for the next few months.

And which is unfortunate.

Love to hear from Ho Ho, but we did this year.

When we were doing the recording, the holiday episode, I did look at my phone to see what time it was.

To see if we can call in.

Yeah, I almost was a little, yeah.

It was like 10 of nine.

And I thought, well, she's probably 10 of nine.

I don't know what that is.

And I thought she's probably not.

Yeah.

She doesn't want to do a podcast.

Yeah.

Also, we have Santa, of course, Paul of Tomchins playing Santa.

We have Neil Campbell as the timekeeper.

And maybe don't play Santa.

I don't know because you're also playing Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Have you went back and forth?

I don't know.

We'll hear it.

I probably did.

Yeah.

Okay.

So anyway, this let's hear a big compendium of clips from this is an extra long episode.

We're going to hear a lot of different clips from it.

This is your number three.

Number three.

I'm a real sweet guy.

You're a sweetheart.

I got my mom the dopest Christmas.

What did you get her for Christmas?

$500 gift card to Starbucks.

Does she go to Starbucks a lot?

No, but I think she should start having coffee.

She's always tired.

Oh, really?

Why?

She stays up later.

She gets up too earlier.

She gets up.

Yeah, both.

She's burning the candle at all the ends.

All the ends, really.

Even the third end, if you know what I mean.

I do not know what you mean.

She's getting mean.

Okay.

I really wish you would not.

But what did she do for a living?

I don't know that we've ever spoken about her.

Yeah, I tried to leave my mom out of this because she said, if you're going to- Yeah, we're talking about your uncle and- Yeah, my uncle and my stepdad, my uncles who shoot each other in Roman candles, all that shit.

My stepdad who's my dad's brother who's actually technically like a step.

It's complicated.

It's a complicated- Yeah, I mean, yeah.

It's an Alec Baldwin, Julia, no.

What was her name?

Meryl Streep situation?

It's complicated.

Yeah.

Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin.

Steve Martin?

Yeah.

I think that's Steve Martin's star.

Wait, what's- No, he's not in its complicated, is he?

Yeah, he owns the bakery.

No, he's the dude who has a- He's got the bakery in the house.

He's building a house.

Yeah, he's got the gray hair.

That's okay.

Perfect.

No, he's- He's the one next to Meryl's big knockers.

He's the one next to Meryl's big knockers.

I was just about to do it.

You're a good knockers.

I'm not going to talk after this so I got to get it in now.

What else is- Are you asked what my mom- I'm asking about your mom.

She's a police chief.

Where?

In Long Island?

Nassau County Police.

Really?

Yeah, she's the head of Special Victims Unit.

Right.

Wait, she's the police chief and the head of the special- She- She's no wonder she's burning the candle above end.

She can't leave the job behind because the police chief job is all paperwork and shit.

Sure, yeah.

But then she's got to get in there and scrape her of the giant- Knock heads.

Yeah.

Oh yeah, she's not supposed to do that.

But she goes- She dabbles in forensics.

She goes down there with the dead bodies and just fucks around with them and shit.

She always periscopes me like some video.

That's the- That's the- That's the camera with the crime scene.

I don't know.

She says it's a way to- She's got like- It gets a feel for the crime.

Oh yeah.

Okay, yeah.

Like when like Native American like smells animal shit in a movie to determine where the- You know, wish we had the animal animal.

Wait, I'm thinking of dances with wolves.

Who- Who'd Kevin Costner play in that?

Who did he play in that?

Yeah.

I don't know.

Was it White Fang?

I thought you were going to say Mary- I mean, next to Mary MacDonald.

What's her name?

I never seen- Oh, okay.

But I will watch it if it helps me get more credits on my internship.

Yeah, you really like you haven't even earned one credit so far.

Yeah, yeah.

You are here so seldom.

I will.

Hey, I fucking should not have interned for a radio station.

Why in California?

It's not a radio station.

Yes, it's a radio station.

It's technically a DVR radio.

That's a great way of putting a podcast.

Yeah, you DVR it.

You listen to it whenever you want.

You fast forward through it.

Yeah, you hit the 15 second forward button whenever someone starts railing on about mattresses or bonobos or anything.

Or dances with wolves.

Or if you just hear me thought talking, you know, like, all right, I know he's only talks in the beginning of the episode, so we'll just skip through and he'll stop using it.

I listen back to your appearances if you think you only talk at the beginning and you should not be talking at the beginning.

Okay, copy that, got that.

All right, from here on out podcast silence.

Okay, which means you're going to talk the entire time?

If you keep looking at me and speaking, I feel the need to respond.

What do you think?

Okay, I need to look elsewhere.

Hey, what the hell?

I'm looking at the ceiling right now.

Yeah, but I'm standing.

So I look.

Hey, yeah, from my end, it looks like.

Okay, I'm going to look down the floor then.

Oh, there you are too.

Sorry.

There's your toes.

Thanks, brother.

Do you have any holiday plans other than that other than singing carols?

You know, I was going to go down to the Rockefeller tree and try to take some off of it off of it.

Yeah, put some on.

No, because I like them so much and my trade home is so small, it can only fit a few.

Oh, so most of the holiday plans.

It's involved trying to do something.

Have a little confidence in yourself.

You've come back to life.

I think you have a lot of the things I do are illegal, a harmful to people.

So I tried like the jump over the grandkids.

I tried it and I got stopped.

What about like take an ornament, leave an ornament, you know?

Tolo.

Yeah, Tolo.

Take one, leave one.

All right, maybe I'll try that.

Maybe I'll, when I get home, I'll craft up some.

Take one ornament, leave one ornament, too, Lou.

I don't know what you're saying.

Tolo.

T-O-O-L-O-O.

Oh, okay, that was T-U-L-U.

No, that's Hulu.

Oh, okay.

Well, you can watch difficult people.

I got, I rack up a lot of miles flying back and forth from this internship, so I watch a lot of television.

Oh, I understand.

Does anyone give you presents or do you give presents?

Well, Ringo and I usually exchange.

Do you?

Yep.

What's the best present that you've received from Ringo?

I tried to receive from Ringo.

From him, last year he got me Yankees coasters for my, you know, my coffee table at home.

Sure, yeah, I know.

What's your use for?

Hey, well, that's great for you.

Unless you meant just coasters of American people from a British perspective.

No, no, no.

You do your Yankees.

You know, the end and the why.

Yeah.

And some pinstripes behind it.

Love it.

It's great.

It keeps my coffee cups.

Are you a fan of the Yankees?

You know, I'm afraid.

Not really.

I go to some games sometimes.

But you have a lot of...

I like to see him.

You have a lot of drinks, though, that are on that coffee table that you want to protect.

I have...

When I go to the fridge to get a drink, I take two or three bottles, you know, so to be a result of the...

You mentioned you know Arod.

How do you know Arod?

I meant to say I know of him.

He's like the only fan.

I know.

I've never met him.

So you know of Arod, you go to see him.

I'm not a fan of you.

That's a lot like anyone going to see a baseball game.

They know of the players and they go to see them.

I meant more like, you know, I don't know everyone on the lineup.

I know the big...

I personally know Don Mattingly.

Do you?

Where did you meet him?

I met him at McKibbs.

Oh, okay.

I got a bar on him, Sid Thurnpike, over by Hofstra.

Yeah.

There's a certain amount of people out there who are listening to this right now just screaming at their radios.

Like, yeah, he said it.

I know what that is.

I know my kids.

I get that reference.

Oh my God.

I pull their car off the fucking road.

I've never seen someone screaming that hat fly up into the flip around and land back on it.

Yeah, that was pretty impressive.

It was impressive.

Yeah.

I don't know how that happened.

And you're wearing a top hat.

I meant to mention that.

You said it was a holiday episode.

Yeah.

You said I'm going to be meeting some big celebs.

Yep.

I was hoping it was one of the Baja men.

But for now, I dressed up.

Yep.

And only the hat, by the way.

You're still wearing a...

Yeah, I'm still wearing a rusty tank top and Quicksilver board shorts and flip flops.

I'm cash, man.

When I come out to LA, I want to fucking beat you up.

Sure.

What do you wear in New York, though?

Same thing.

Yeah, yeah.

Except in the winter.

Yeah, in the winter, I slap on a drug rug.

What is a drug rug?

You know, like those...

I keep saying Baja on this show, which I think we're about.

But it's a Baja.

It's like one of those Tweed hoodie things.

Tweed hoodie Baja?

Tweed hoodie Baja.

A T-H-B.

It sounds like a children's poem.

Yeah, you sound like...

You sound like docuses.

Tweed hoodie Baja.

Tweed hoodie Baja had a problem.

His mommy.

You know, it was like...

They look like Ranchero hoodies.

Oh my god.

All of these words are just like...

I know the words...

Because you know, drug rugs growing up because they were for like hippies and scumbags and hacky sacks.

Okay.

Other scumbags.

Oh, the scumbags.

Different kinds of scumbags.

Not the kind of traditional Long Island scumbags, but the different kind of Long Island scumbags.

So what are you topping yourself this year?

Yeah, okay.

So I already have like, you know, knives and guns.

I gotta get a little creative with my weapons.

Sure.

Yeah.

So I'm giving out a lot of interesting things and hoping that kids get a little excited about how they can use them.

Like I put a millen baller and a kid stocking last year and I watched him the whole year to see when he would use it.

Well, you watched him all the time?

Yeah.

How old is the kid?

Eight.

And he just got into touching his dick.

That's a little early.

It's a little late.

Okay.

Well, I'm with it.

Hey, I agree to disagree.

Whatever.

I'm ageless.

It's not pedophilia.

Right.

So you could be young.

You could be eight if you're ageless.

I'm a million.

Yeah.

Okay.

That's true.

Again, that is very hard to follow.

How many, how many shits does he take a day?

The boy.

Yeah.

I'm wondering what's normal.

That was going to be my question.

You're wondering what's going to be the first eight year old boy for you.

For anyone for a human being.

He takes two dukies a day.

One in the morning and one at night.

Really?

So at the night he builds up a lot, I guess.

Does he eat when he sleeps?

Yeah, maybe he does.

What do you mean, maybe he does?

You are a bad elf.

You're lying.

I am a liar, but I also was sleeping next to him.

I'm peaceful.

So you're sleeping when he's sleeping?

Yeah.

And you're just assuming he's not doing anything.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

So in that song when it says he sees you when he's sleeping, he doesn't.

They're talking about it.

But Santa's sleep when everyone, when all the things.

Santa's awake all night.

Oh, okay.

I sleep with the babies.

So does Santa see you sleeping?

It's a terrifying phrase, oh, oh.

Santa watches me sleeping because he's a pervert.

He loves it.

He likes to watch me dream and think it's about him.

You've never dreamed about him.

Nah, yeah, I have.

Yeah, I have.

I dreamed about what everyone ever met.

I agree.

You've met everybody.

Yeah.

I can't go to...

Did you just cycle through him?

Is it one dream with a lot of people in it?

Yeah, it's like a concert every night.

Oh, wow.

Are you performing?

Santa's playing.

Oh, wow.

Everyone you ever met is in a band?

I thought you were playing.

You say Santa's playing.

You say you don't dream about Santa?

He's playing at a concert.

And what songs does he sing?

Santa Claus is...

Santa Baby!

That's a song to him.

I never said to be a since.

It's a dream.

Oh, okay.

Santa Baby, get under my beard planty please.

Wait a minute.

He's gonna crawl up and under these his own bed.

A beard comes out of him.

He doesn't have to get under him.

He's talking to the Santa Baby.

Oh, it's Santa.

Oh, it's not Santa, come, baby.

It's Santa Baby.

No, it's Santa Baby.

Oh, is there a Santa Baby?

Yes.

Does he have children?

Well, it's not his child.

It's named after him.

He's the godfather.

Oh, okay.

He can't produce sperm.

He can't.

Why not?

Is it just snowflakes and frost?

Yeah.

What are you doing?

It's unique.

Santa jizzes snowflakes is what I'm hearing.

Yeah.

That's fucking hot.

It's tight.

So, Maxwell, there's so many songs about time.

You've only mentioned ones that have the word time.

Are there any Christmas songs that have actual times, like 1246?

Oh, well, upon a midnight clear, I said the most.

Okay, you said that one.

Yeah, sorry to come.

Twelve days of Christmas.

Oh, yeah.

That's a time period.

Yeah, 24 hours.

Yes.

Is Pink Floyd considered a Christmas-themed band?

Because I've got a song called Time.

I wouldn't think so.

Do you like that song that goes like, did it in a time?

Did it?

I don't think I'm familiar.

It's from the 70s.

I'm not too much of a- I know what's on your talk about.

I'm using ecologies.

I know which one you're talking about.

See it.

No, you did it already.

So it's a lot of people talking about time.

And then you have New Year's Eve where it's 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, midnight.

Yes, I love it.

People are so concerned about time.

And everyone's talking about the year, the year that was.

Yeah.

And they used to go, what was the best movie of the year, the best songs of the year?

Everyone's so thinking about time.

I love it.

And wearing glasses with a- that presented a certain time, like a 2016 glasses.

Yeah.

I think people should count up to New Year's.

So it's like 11.59 and 50 seconds.

11.59 and 51 seconds.

That's what's full of- That's what's full of- Yeah, you know what I mean?

It's like, let's stop looking at the past.

Right.

Yeah.

Oh, I'm looking forward to next year.

Really?

2016?

Yes, it's- A most excellent year.

Yes, because there's extra time in it.

Yes.

It's one more than the previous.

One more day, there's a leave day in 2016.

Oh!

More time!

That's exciting.

Oh, that's going to be a real- that's going to fuck me up big time.

Yeah.

Hey, I had a question.

We just had daylight savings time where we went back an hour.

I loved it.

You loved it even though we- Oh, because it's next to our- Extra time, yes.

And again, that whole weekend, whenever it talks about time, music to mind, very years.

What about spring forward though?

You're losing an hour.

Here's the deal on spring forward.

Okay.

Oh.

Don't like losing the hour.

Could do without that.

Uh-huh.

But again, I appreciate the discussion about time.

Okay.

Yeah.

What about all the articles about do we need daylight savings time?

At least they're talking about it.

Right.

All press is good press.

Tis!

Okay.

Well, um, uh, happy holidays.

I don't know if you're a Christian if I should say Merry Christmas.

I've never been to a church.

Not even outside of one?

Well, you don't need to be invited.

I suppose outside.

I didn't think- Technically we're outside of a church right now.

Walking past.

Well, no.

Have you ever stopped even- even for a millisecond and you would know in front of a church.

Oh, to tie my very shoe.

Just one?

Yes!

Okay.

Good.

Very, very few times in my life have both shoes become untied at the same time.

So, uh, you- A lot of the lucky ones then.

Yes, I suppose.

So you don't have a horse in this race about the war on Christmas or- No, I like Christmas.

I like presents.

Uh-huh.

Yeah.

Present.

That's a time.

Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

No time like it.

As far as I know.

Oh.

Yeah.

Is that true?

Yes, it is true.

There's no time like the present.

By the way, he's not some sort of expert or a god from on high.

He's a guy.

You're not an expert about time?

I am an expert on time and I think of myself as being a sort of distant watcher observing the passage of time throughout the universe.

No, but you're just a guy who works in a watch shop.

Yes.

Um, and what's going on at the shop?

Who shoppers it again?

My brother-in-law, Desmond Longo.

Right.

How's Desmond?

How's Desmond been- Does Desmond be- Great.

I just gave him my Christmas list the other day.

He's married to your sister.

He's married to my sister.

They promised to buy me one present this year.

Oh, that's nice.

They've not bought you any presents that they use.

They've- they've- they've promised in the past.

Or has the amount changed?

You said one present.

No, no.

He's always equal to or lesser than one.

Oh, okay.

Equal to or less than.

Yes.

Or zero.

Or if we're getting a negative integer.

They're going to steal your stuff.

Yes.

There are a bit times they've taken.

What happened to you the time you got nothing?

Did you cry a little baby?

Yes.

And did you swoop in and give him something?

Uh, no, because he's not naughty.

He's a bitch.

Oh, really?

I am.

I'm a bitch.

You're a nice boy.

That's true.

Yeah.

I would love- what if you were a little naughty though?

You know what I mean?

What would you do if you could be bad for a day?

If I were bad, I suppose I'd change someone's watch so it had the wrong time on it.

Oh, no, then they might be late or early.

Yes.

Oh, I can't think of it.

Oh, no, no.

You wouldn't do it.

I wouldn't do it.

I'd do it.

Wivering.

I felt like Scrooge learning his lesson.

Again, another wonderful thing about Christmas.

One of our most famous time travel stories of Christmas Carol.

Mm-hmm.

What do you think of Bill and Ted?

Bill and Ted's good.

I go Christmas Carol.

Yep.

Of time travel.

Time travel movies.

There's only four.

You can really- and I'm counting all the back to the futures as one.

And all the Bill and Ted's as one.

Okay, great, great, great.

It goes number one of Christmas Carols.

Sure.

Number two, Terminator Genesis.

Okay, you're not counting those as one.

The other movies are in groups.

Yes.

But Terminator is not- Okay, great.

No!

Great.

Number three, tie between back to the tie.

You're the one who said top four.

He just ate top five.

No, tie between Terminator, I mean, back to futures and Bill and Ted's.

It's a five-way tie for third.

What's fourth?

Second.

T2.

Okay.

What do you make of movies where like it's someone switches bodies or something and they kind of get old fast?

Trash!

That's just as a film critic.

It does have nothing to do with time.

I appreciate true cinema.

Yes, yes.

What's your favorite movie?

Which- I mean, I guess we talked about time travel movies, but just safety last.

I think we've discussed this before.

Okay.

And your favorite magazine?

Time!

Great, great, great.

Song?

Time!

Okay, great.

What about time after time?

Oh, yes, Cindy Loper.

Ooh, that's nice.

That's got time so nice.

That's twice.

Oh, wonderful musical poem.

And so what did you ask your long go for?

The Blu-ray of Terminator Genesis!

Okay.

Your number two favorite movie.

It's the number one of the year!

Oh, okay, great.

It's total bullshit that they showed that John Connor was a fucking Terminator in the trailer to that movie.

Oh, spoiler alert, I haven't seen the trailer yet.

I mean, to spoil the trailer, John.

Yeah, you were only going to watch the trailer.

Yeah, Christmas Eve, Ringo and I get together and watch all the trailers we haven't seen yet this year.

Hell, that's one we won't have to watch out of the hundreds.

Now, I'm very excited because, do you know how when I want something, I just go ahead and take it.

Sure, you're so rich.

Wait, do you pay for it?

I'm so rich.

What, I pay for anything?

Of course, I'm a gentleman.

Okay, so you just take it and then someone pays for it.

I say I want that.

He has a trunk full of money.

Go away.

Is there anything in this room you want, by the way?

I would love a trunk full of money.

I would, well, it's relative to what it is.

Oh, okay.

I don't probably hope they were everything.

If I'm going to get a pack of chewing gum, I don't say there's a trunk full of money.

Really, you call from the trunk?

Yeah, I open up the trunk.

Okay.

I pick up the relevant coins.

Okay, I thought you were just giving trunks out.

Is you organized inside the trunk or is the money just everywhere?

There's the local poverty truck that loves.

Okay, good.

It's not like a pirate boot.

But now there's two trunks.

I keep two trunks of money in the boot of my car.

One is itemized, two trunks in the trunk.

If you like, I do.

Well, then you will have it, dude.

I could deny you nothing.

You can't deny us an agitation.

Would you know what did so many Laquah waters?

I love the pimple most, baby.

Oh, my gosh.

How did it get enough of that pimple moose?

How did it turn out, by the way, the show turned out well?

I was so busy on the phone.

Well, you're a little over here.

You're saying, Bob, out of town previews, what you're trying to do?

You were trying to have the worst out of town preview?

Oh, that's what we got hired.

I was like a weird pseudo-producer type situation.

That is right.

But my plan went down the tree because the musical is a bit magnificence.

Oh, well.

And now I'm next to your incompetent direction, Tino.

I told you, I didn't know what you were doing.

I was doing it, and you said, that's perfect.

That's exactly right.

Wow.

But back to these two trunks.

Yes.

So one trunk, compartments organized by size, denomination, color, et cetera.

The second trunk, just like a sort of pirate affair where you open it up, just gold coins spilling out of it.

That's what I tried to use to buy that Downton Abbey house in the morning.

Oh, right.

And set it to me.

And I've never forgotten it.

Oh, so it's like that nunnery that Katy Perry's trying to buy.

Well, she succeeded.

She succeeded?

No, she didn't.

She wants to go on the nuns.

I believe the city of Los Angeles stepped in and said, yes, she may have it.

I don't believe so.

I think it's still up in the air.

Still up in the air!

My favorite movie.

It's still up in the air.

The sequel.

With that still flop, Colin still flying.

So I said, here's the thing I want.

I want to compose the canteenu music for the next Star Wars film.

Oh, Katy!

What's his name?

What's the name of the fellow in the modal nodes?

Shh.

A bit fortune.

I don't know.

He's the one with the snake thing.

Yeah, he's the Twilight that works for us.

I wasn't paying attention.

It's the July, the last one was the singer, of course.

Oh, great music!

A great musician!

It's the Bith Shuffle, right there?

Bith's those guys?

I think his name is DAT.

What's it called?

Bith's?

The Bith Shuffle is the name of the album.

It's very.

I don't like the way that hits the album.

No, I don't understand it.

The Muths and Shuffle.

It's Figuring Dan.

Figuring Dan the modal nodes.

Yeah, Figuring Dan and the modal nodes.

But I think Sean Williams-Scott actually did the music for it.

Sean Williams- Yes, from Difler's mom's son.

Yeah, from Difler's mom's son?

With the big knockers?

Still this mom would have been- No, no knockers are giant!

Whoa, mama!

There was part of the show- That was part of the show that happened for you?

Yeah, there was part of the show that- I know.

So, but yes, Figuring Dan- Yes.

But I have something to tell you, and you're not going to like this.

Now, before you tell me anything, I know what you're going to say.

Andrew Lloyd-Wabbe, you can't compose music for us.

Science-fictional film?

It's outside of your- That was what I was going to say.

Well, that's where you're wrong.

Get a load of this.

Erm...

You can't- that's your case.

Every night of the container.

Right?

Okay, but that's just like- Wow, that was a good song!

That wasn't bad.

That's the previous song and you just added lyrics to it.

That's just a sampling.

It's just a- And you're not a lyricist.

That's my- that's my audition to let you know.

I get it.

Okay, okay, okay.

And I'm not a lyricist.

How dare you?

Well, you're not.

You're doing some rices.

I haven't worked with Tim Rice in yours.

Okay, well, who's your lyricist now?

Who did School of Rock?

School of Rock was an existing property.

Okay, but who did- I adapted- Someone else.

Jack Black.

Jack Black, help that.

Jack Black, could you know his bad- His wife could eat no lean.

There's one song at School of Rock where someone just does weird scatting for a while.

Shit ass!

That!

So, uh, but I do have something bad to tell you.

Is it time to tell you something bad right now?

I- I don't have a set time in my calendar for you to tell me something bad, but- Wait, who's- Oh my gosh, Max, are you all right?

Max, are you all right?

I'm a- Calendar.

Is this heaven above?

Do you like going to Marie Calendars, the restaurant?

Yes.

It's spelled differently.

True, but the pies look like clocks!

Especially when there's a slice taken out of it.

What is this?

You say you have bad news, what is this?

Okay, you want to write the new canteen and things.

I'm going to do it, yes.

All right, today this shows is Monday.

The movie comes out Friday.

It's a little late to get in there and- For the next one, the Skotchrik, of course I know that the Force Awakens comes out.

Okay.

Never mind the fact that I was the one who said that title and- And knows everything about it.

Yes.

This is for the next one.

The episode H-Dear Boy.

Okay, but I just read a news story.

Oh, did you?

Yeah, a few days ago.

Oh, I'm glad to see you still have your subscription to Highlight's magazine.

We talked about- I tried to- I talked over a time bit.

I just apologize.

Were you talking about highlights before you got in here?

Did you really?

Did you ever choose? Did they come up?

Goofers and Gallant.

Yeah.

The two references from that.

Goofers.

Oh, I know.

What a- What a- What a- What a rogue name.

What do you think about Goofers, Ho-Ho?

Ho-Ho, sounds like an elf that got a fucking job somewhere else.

Is that where Goofers and Gallant come from?

They're two elves.

And you're mad that he got a new job?

Uh, yeah, because you're supposed to leave the North Pole, you're supposed to have allegiance to Santa for your whole life, eternity.

Is there an oath that you swear?

Yeah.

Yeah, could you recite it for us right now?

The old type of swear?

Yeah.

It's fucking- like her butt shit fuck butt!

Up your dong and suck it out your bong-hole.

Come out your mouth and stick it up your tongue.

Okay, that's a different thing to that.

I believe that is an oath because she had a handover.

You asked me to swear an oath.

Yeah.

I was standing.

I always respect the flag.

So, but I read a new story a couple of days ago.

And I'm afraid.

And uh- And verbal restraint.

They've written the new cantina theme.

What's this now?

Yeah, the Hamilton musical.

The person who wrote that, Lin-Manuel Miranda.

What?

From in the Heights?

That's Yaga Abzaj?

Yes.

He's written- He's- yeah, the newer kind of like new- What?

New breed of musical- of musical composer.

No, yeah.

Now, have you seen this Hamilton?

No, I have not.

It takes- it takes- let me say.

It takes quite a lot of liberties with the time period in which it is set.

Much like you took liberties with cats.

And roller skates?

Who's going to complain?

Other cats going to say, I'll see you at court.

We don't do that.

I think that's an interesting thought that the cats are really upset about it.

You could probably say the same thing about Alex and Hamilton.

He's not going to speak about it.

But- but they're human beings and this is- this is your American history.

You all should be very upset.

I'm not really that upset.

Well, you should be, it's what I'm saying.

Okay, well, I'm not.

Can you imagine Alex and Hamilton saying- I'm talking about- let's battle.

What's your take on Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter?

That's actually very sexy.

He's very excited.

You took liberties with Jesus Christ super-star unless you'd think he doesn't exist.

He's a made up person.

That was very long ago.

And the story of Jesus belongs to us all.

Smoke started coming out of your mouth.

Yeah.

And John Lennon over here took- I was vaping earlier.

Oh, okay.

Oh, you got me.

You held it in that whole time.

Yeah, I did what?

It's my secret shame.

I thought I could get it out before the elevator doors opened.

John Lennon- John Lennon over here took a lot of liberties with that Sergeant Pepper thing.

That was only 20 years ago.

Oh, are you saying the actual Sergeant Pepper?

He fought in God's sense?

Then he fight in General Soze Army?

Yes.

From the Chinese- From the chicken?

Chicken to China.

The Chinese chicken.

The Chinese chicken to the brain starts sticking.

Watching X-Files and no lights on.

Adolomme them?

Hope the smoking man's in this one.

It's Hollywood facts and you going down down down to Inglewood now.

It's chicken.

Clever and lots of bars.

Glitz and clever and lots of bars.

Get a drink at a club.

Go and walk in front of Chinese theater.

Hollywood facts.

Take out your days.

Check out the facts.

It's Hollywood facts, bro.

Nice.

Check out the facts.

It's Hollywood facts and we're going down down to Inglewood now.

Everybody goes to the back and know you're fine.

Glitz and clever and lots of bars.

Get a drink at a club.

Then you go walk in front of Chinese theater.

Hollywood facts.

Take out your days.

Check out the facts.

It's the Hollywood facts, bro.

Oh, we got to add that.

Number three.

Mmm, so good.

No, I thought I wasn't looking at it.

I thought maybe that that was another video.

The Cody was like, so good.

Let's, we should play a game of we should turn around and we'll say, is it the other person or is it a Cody video?

All right, Cody, do you have a video lined up?

Okay, I'm going to turn around.

A video that could conceivably be one of us just in this room.

Right, okay.

All right, I'm going to turn around and you guys decide amongst yourself, I'm going to take the microphone, but I'm turned around.

You guys decide amongst yourself whether it's going to be you, Paul, or a video.

So it's our first, is it Paul or is it a Cody video?

Month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain.

Okay, turn around.

Okay, turning around.

Now let me think.

Now you normally have a crackly kind of a lot of room tone crackly.

I have a lot of recorded room tone when you speak.

I have a lot of butterscotch rappers in my pocket.

Right.

That's got to be you, Paul.

It was a video.

It was a video?

Oh, oh.

What was that video, Cody?

That was TSL yet reading the wasteland.

Oh, interesting.

Hey, getting a little education.

He crushed it, by the way.

Fucking T.S.

You crushed that, bro.

Yo, did you see T.S.

L.A.

read the wasteland?

He fucking crushed it.

T.S.

You're my boy, man.

You fucking crushed that.

Just call me T.S.

You don't like it?

It's that.

I like that, by the way.

Well, because people call you.

It's true.

Some people do.

And that bothers you, I believe.

No, it's like the only thing that bothers me about it is that people think that they invented it.

Right.

And they say it like, hey, it's something I just thought of.

Yeah, no, it's ever said this before.

To be fair, everyone said it before.

To be fair.

They did invent it.

They just don't know other people have invented it.

It's sort of like, you know.

They're not joke thieves.

No, not joke thieves.

They're not the fat Jew.

But by the way, fat Jew, what's next?

Fat Jew, what's next?

Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

By the way, fat Jew, what's next?

That is a great look.

This is waiting for a bunch of remixes.

Wait, someone remixed that.

A bunch of song to be written around.

Someone please take it.

Do what you will with it.

By the way.

Fat Jew, what's next?

It's good.

So good.

So right.

Hey, we got to take a break.

We're going to have a, we're probably going to count down, right?

I bet we will.

No, we won't.

We'll be right back.

Why did you set me up?

Comedy Bang Bang, we're back here and Paul F. Tomkins.

And yeah, that's right.

You thought we were going to count down and error another clip that's part of our countdown, right?

I did.

I totally did.

Because you know what though you led me to believe that we were going to do that?

I kind of did.

I led you down that primrose path.

Ugh.

Instead, we're going to do a little something that I like to call and we haven't done one yet on the countdown, a little something called a bonus clip.

That's right.

We are going to play a little bonus clip.

Now in the past, we've played bonus clips because there have been little chunks of episodes that whereas maybe the episode as a whole was not a countdown worthy, but there's something that happened in the episode.

You're like one good moment.

Yeah.

Or we've played bonus clips to save a life.

Sure.

And this is one of those.

This did not end up making the countdown this particular episode, but when we released the episodes for the countdown, this particular clip is something that a lot of people were talking about voting for.

And this is from an episode from April 28th.

This is episode 418 called Paul Riser and the Apple Tree.

So Brendan Small, great comedian, he created home movies and Metalocalips and a some virtue also on not only the guitar, but also his voice.

He can do a lot of characters.

He does Victor and Tiny.

And also it can be told.

And also Willy.

These three characters.

And he plays all three characters at the same time.

And not at the same time.

He goes back and forth from them at the same time in the same recording.

And anytime I ask him to do the show and I ask him once every month, once every two months, something like that, you never know what you're going to get with him.

Sometimes he'll show up and be a total asshole.

It'll be like four hours late drunk.

No, always a professional, always super nice.

But what I mean to say is sometimes he'll come and he'll just kind of riff in the character voices and every once in a while he'll bring something that he has made at home and has just been waiting to debut.

And this time he did that.

A previous time he had edited together a podcast that they had recorded.

Oh my God.

Some big laughs.

And this is another big laugh one.

This is, he's debuting a song that Victor is singing.

And so we're going to play this clip.

It's really funny, a really funny clip.

This is a an episode that you are not going to forget.

This is Brendan Small from Paul Reiser and the Apple Tree.

Well, let me set this up.

If you don't mind, this is a song that Victor wrote.

He kept on homing this to when we're sitting under this apple tree.

Okay.

And I said, Victor, you got to, but you got to record this song.

And what did you say, Victor?

I said, well, I would be hard to do, but we could do this, but I cannot do this alone.

You can't do it alone.

Yeah.

You said he can do it alone.

So we all, we all pitched in.

Pitch in singing?

Well, just helping arrange in the whole song.

Okay.

So why would you think you can't do it alone?

I mean, this is, you're supposedly a singer, but I don't know nothing about this studio life style.

All right.

About, about brothing babies.

You know anything about that?

Boy, brothing babies is also a very difficult thing.

Very difficult thing.

Yeah.

A lot of people don't know.

I know a little bit about that.

But I have not done this.

Were you an OBGYN in your home country?

I have not done that.

Oh, okay.

No, but this song, it's about an apple tree and how wonderful it is to live underneath the apple tree.

Okay.

I don't know whether this is going to have broad appeal, but not a lot of people live underneath the apple tree.

No, it does.

It's this thing's a hit and he is a really interesting factoid.

Okay.

The song is the exact length that it takes to eat an apple.

Really?

I'm guessing.

I didn't realize it was a uniform ton because some apples are smaller.

It's true.

It's three minutes.

And that's what it takes three minutes to eat an apple?

Any apple?

Well, I mean, if it's a really little one, probably last.

Do you know how long a little factoid you know how long it takes to fully digest an apple?

Three to four months.

Three to four months for one apple to actually pass through.

All everything.

Yeah.

Wow.

If you eat the whole core and everything.

Oh, okay.

That includes the wooden crate that it comes in sometimes.

Oh, yeah.

That does not pass easily.

No, yeah.

But when it does, you know, again, I didn't mean to get into a whole digestible.

No, but then the audience would like to know that.

Yeah.

A lot of packaging to this.

Yeah.

It has to work through stuff.

Yeah, the bubble wrap.

Yeah.

If you're getting them shipped in from an orchard.

Yeah.

You know, the shake on apple a day keeps the doctor away.

However, if you eat the whole crate and everything that brings the doctor to you.

Yeah.

So it's like an opposite situation.

It's very ironic.

Exactly.

Scott, it's creating jobs.

Yeah.

Sure.

For doctors.

Yeah.

We need more doctors.

And so yes, doctors can't find work.

Nope.

And they can't find borders either from what I understand.

Now, would you like to listen to it?

Okay.

We already said we want to listen to it.

You're the one holding everything up talking about apple.

You're the center that properly.

Well, all you did was say that it's the exact time it takes to eat an apple.

That setting it up properly?

That's the factoid.

Okay.

We don't.

When I listen to a song on the radio, I don't need the DJ to come out with a factoid before I listen to the song.

Okay.

I can just hear the song.

See, I'm different.

I enjoy the factoid.

I like the factoid.

Alright.

Well, we've got the factoid at this point.

Paul's happy.

Do you want to hear the song?

I did the one say I pay for the whole thing.

Okay.

Take it easy, Willie.

You get...

Tiny, you get what I'm saying about it.

I listen.

I don't want to take sides, but between you and me, you drive me crazy.

You just...

You really?

Yeah.

I mean, I mean, he's really driving me crazy.

I live in his yard.

I don't want to mess with him.

If in eight months with this, I can't stand five minutes of this.

You still a little bit, but I mean, it has a lot of money.

Yeah.

Hey, Willie.

Sorry to...

That's a rat I couldn't even hear what you were saying.

How come I don't get had phones?

We don't have spare headphones for every single rando who walks in off the street.

All right.

Do you have the song?

Oh my God.

I'm gonna live with you.

This is nice.

I don't see any problem here.

I'm not a little bit of a rat.

I can't replicate any other way.

If you were to fully an apple chew, you probably would go out and buy a real apple and then chew into it.

You probably wouldn't do it any other way.

I got apples.

The apple tree song.

You were listening to it?

What are you kidding me?

Kiss girls.

I wish I was you.

Thanks to Brendan.

It didn't quite make the top 15, but super funny stuff.

When we come back, we're going to have the top two episodes of the year, and also our number one live episode of the year.

It is coming down to it, guys.

We are getting through it.

When we come back, we will do that.

More comedy bang bang after this.

I can't wait to see what it is.

My chest is constricting.

Hold on a second.

Can you finish the episode before we take you to the emergency room?

Let me eat that bread.

We'll do it.

That's right.

This is from April.

Just ten days before that last episode, the Paul Reiser and the apple tree.

This is from April 18.

This is an episode called, what comes out in April on HBO, the home box office?

The Bill Simmons' Holocaust Council?

No, every year, not something that got canceled.

Any given April?

It came in April.

Game of Thrones does.

Silicon Valley comes out.

I'm back in a year in a row.

Thomas Middleditch and Martin Starr and Camille Nagiani all got together to celebrate the premiere of the show.

More like I asked them to do the show a favor and they do it in order to promote their show.

We have a really good time on both of these episodes.

The first time I believe Middleditch ever did the show was on the previous one of the previous year.

These are really funny.

Basically Martin and Camille and myself just play ourselves and Thomas improvises and insane character.

At least one.

This one is a classic.

This is Turd Dunkweed.

We're going to hear a little bit about his life.

This is a lot of fun.

This is a great character.

Let's hear it.

This is your number two.

Oh, and Turd Dunkweed just walked in.

Hey, do not look the way I thought you would make it.

I'm a pencil man.

Very thin.

It's like an orange hair that looks like an eraser.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, that's part of my look.

I'm doing stand-up comedy now and Camille Nagiani's helping me out, aren't you?

Yeah, he sort of approached me and I saw some talent in him and I was like, I'll give this a point.

I saw some talent.

And you're wearing a yellow, just kind of shirt and...

Yellow blazer?

And then like pointy black shoes that look like the number two black.

Number two lead in the yellow pencil.

Yes.

And little tiny yellow shorts.

On your sleeve here, does it say N-O period two?

Yes, yes, it says N-O period two.

That is a tattoo.

Oh, wow, you got that through the jacket on to you.

When you said on your sleeve, you meant the all the tattoos on this arm.

That's a preview.

Yeah.

And it is on my blazer, but then see when I roll it up.

Oh, okay.

It's also on my arm and the exact same place.

Wow, heavily tattooed.

You have like a see through blazer.

Yeah, there's also a lot of permanent scarring I've done, but that was from another life in Texas.

Okay, okay.

We're not ready to talk about the scarring.

I can't save it for this day.

Let him joke about whatever he wants to joke about.

This is how comedians get through the program in their lives.

Sure, but it gets kind of dark on stage and then it's hard.

Like I'm just saying find your ceiling.

Well turn the lights up.

Yeah.

Well, that is funny.

Turn off the dark.

So what, uh...

What, uh...

You're a comedian.

Yes.

Where did you see him, uh, Camille?

He was doing an open mic and uh, meltdown and uh, he just sort of...

Okay.

I just jumped on stage.

I grabbed the mic from whoever was talking and I did my...

Radio.

Damn.

Why are you speaking like an Englishman now?

You're from Texas.

No, no, I'm just, that, tell us speak.

How do you speak?

Um, Scott, acumen.

Oh, well thank you.

It's always nice of me to fan.

He's just got a lot of personality and it comes out.

Yes.

This is what I like about him.

You never know how he's going to say it word.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

You know, before we get into your background, I'd love to hear a little...

I'm just so tickled by it.

By the way, this, this, this studio is not an open carry situation.

I'm going to have to ask you to put those away.

It's a prop.

No, he's talking about my parabasies.

Yeah.

You're two oozies.

Are you talking about my parabasies?

Which by the way, they're in holsters, which is very weird.

Well, yeah.

Uh, I'm not a heathen.

I put my oozies in my holsters.

Okay.

I can't shoot my dick off.

See?

It's a great stuff.

He does.

He does have some great stuff.

Do you mind putting those away though?

Yeah, I think I get them.

Put them away.

I don't have that back.

Okay.

Just put them on the table.

So at least we can all have a fighting chance at them if something goes down.

Not the turds.

Oh, sorry.

I felt some sub-gun gentleman who is a real looker gave me these two turds on the way out.

He said, I'm going to find more of these, but here you can have these two.

Okay, you find him attractive Thomas Middle these one.

Oh, God, yes.

Okay.

So you are your, where do you lean?

A little to the left.

Uh-huh.

Okay.

See?

Great stuff.

Okay.

A little to the left is his catchphrase.

Oh, really?

And he really like, uh, crowd goes nuts when they hear it.

I mean, he, they don't expect.

You gotta set me up for it though.

I can't just say a little to the left.

We gotta set something up for it and then you'll see.

Daddy, daddy, what are the directions?

Uh, in what direction should I drive in order to, uh, reach the Denny's?

Um, say it up here.

I mean, the address here is- No, no, no.

So it's pretty- You call that a set up?

I don't know.

I don't know how to do that.

That's just saying, hey, which direction do I go?

And then obviously it's going to make sense.

Okay.

Well, how do you want me to set you up then?

Uh, like politically.

Yes.

What's your affiliation?

That's exactly what I did.

A little to the lamp.

Koot me, noon-joonie.

I love how you say it.

He's a real special guy and, um, I hope one day he'll let me sleep over in his guest bedroom.

That's not part of our relationship.

Just in your guest bedroom.

I mean, you do have a guest bedroom that's never used.

I do, but we've talked- Why wouldn't you let him- Do you have a place to sit down?

No, I'm on the street.

You're on the street?

I am on- I am currently without a residence.

You're- Kumi, you know this?

You're taking money from this man and you're letting him live on the street without getting him a place to stay?

He hasn't made me any money yet.

He hasn't?

Not yet.

You're his manager.

It's your job to get him job.

Yes, I will.

And then he can fucking get his own apartment, but right now, I mean- He's doing it- First of all, I gave him a bunch of money.

You know what he did with it?

He bought two Uzzies.

That's stupid.

Well.

How much did you get?

Because Uzzies are expensive.

The neighborhood has been a lot less dangerous though since he got those Uzzies.

I've got to be honest, when you're on the street, tell you what you could really use.

Uzzies.

Like, how much is a Uzzie?

A Uzzie's like about, you know, $5,000, $6,000.

Yeah, I gave him $10,000 to $12,000.

Yeah, I used that $10,000 to $12,000 on a diet Coke and two Uzzies.

He got him- Well, yeah, I got to get my caffeine fix somehow and I don't like coffee.

So, why are you on the street?

Tell us about yourself.

I mean, you're from Texas?

Well, yes.

And in the late 90s, I was in an abandoned err, what do you want to call it?

I don't know.

And craft graveyard.

Do you know when they put all the busted up planes?

Oh, like old planes?

Yeah, yeah, I was in there.

Why were you in there?

Well, it was a place that I could find where I could turn tricks and suck and fuck.

Okay.

As long as I could.

Okay.

So, sort of like a top gun fantasy.

Yeah, I was in Arizona.

We have said that not to talk about that aspect of your life.

I'm sorry.

I thought it was part of what he asked what I was doing before I got into comedy and how I thought- Well, I don't, you know, I mean- Okay.

Starting from before then.

No, no, no, after.

We're trying to cure it.

Cure it.

Well, when I was 16, I was viciously assaulted by a pack of hyenas that were brought over illegally on a cargo ship.

Okay.

So, if they were legal hyenas, it would be all right?

Well, I think, yeah, well, they wouldn't have been brought over because she can't bring a hyenas.

Oh, I see it.

Well, I have no idea.

Oh, I see.

It was my first job.

I was on a ship.

What were we doing there?

I was off loading cargo, old school style without a piece of equipment just with my back.

Okay.

And one of the boxes burst over and a pack of 12 to 13, 12 to 13.

So, around- It was a big old box.

Oh, okay.

So, 12 and a baby?

That'd be an asshole.

I couldn't count it.

I was being ripped apart behind it.

I had no idea.

Sort of eyewitnesses later said it was about 12 to 14 and maybe some of them were, you know, younger and- Oh, okay.

It was terrible.

I can tell you this.

So, that's where you got these scars, the aforementioned scars?

No, these were self-inflated.

These are self-inflated.

Oh, okay.

And why?

What's going on?

Because I deserve happiness.

It makes them feel alive.

Okay.

So, was that before or after the turning tricks in the Arizona?

That was before.

I was turning tricks about in my early 20s from about when I was 20, one to about 29.

I was taking all comers in any which way or form.

And coming all takers.

Ah, there he is.

He's being named to you.

Using.

Using, really.

I don't think I will.

It's not my particular brand.

Okay.

What is your act?

Can I hear a little bit of your act?

Oh, goodness.

Put me on the spot.

Do the one about the banana peel.

Oh, the banana peel.

That sounds good.

This is his big closer.

Do that one.

This is a closer.

Do the line.

There's a lot of setup to it so it may not make sense.

Do the full 10 minute version of it.

Yeah, I'd like to hear it.

Okay, I'll tell you.

I'll tell you.

I'll do the last little bit.

It won't make sense because it'll come out of the box.

Okay, so the last nine minutes.

You guys want me to do my whole routine.

How am I ever going to get paid if I give it away on the radio for free?

Yeah, I mean, that's the question of podcasting.

Yeah, why are we doing this?

Yeah, I'll tell you.

I'm not getting paid.

Yeah, no, no.

Absolutely not.

And the last like 30 seconds of your banana routine.

Okay, okay.

Just the last 30 seconds.

Okay, okay.

You have to picture now, okay, by this point in the story, I'm an Ecuador and I have one of those tiny little white hats.

Okay, so I said to the barkeep, I didn't order this.

I ordered the banana peel.

Okay, that's three seconds.

So we need the next 27.

Well he's positive for laughter for a while.

Okay, because it's referencing other things.

Sure.

And then you say, this is a big laugh.

Big thing.

And then he gets this next one is the big.

So the barkeep says, I don't have one of those.

Here's your shot.

Ten seconds.

And so I took the shot and I shoved it up my ass.

Fifteen seconds.

So you have 15 seconds more.

This is like big.

At this point the crowd is going insane.

You get a picture.

You know the beginning.

I'm totally picture.

You know the beginning to we will rock you by queen.

Yeah.

And they're all going, that's what they're doing.

They can't control themselves.

Yeah.

And this is that meltdown.

Right.

Okay.

Doesn't hold that many people.

But it's very successful.

Are they just playing?

We will rock you on the rifons.

No, you're big dang dang dick.

You're big dong dick.

You're big fucking cow asshole.

He's been a bitch.

Okay.

Calm down.

Focus up.

He does not deal with hecklers very well.

Well they can't tell you they get it.

This cat's got claws.

Anyway, I put the shot glass of rum up my butt hole.

And then I do a little dance.

And are you describing what you're doing on stage?

Or are you, is this what you're saying?

Hold on.

I gotta go.

Where you go?

No, no, no, no.

You can't do it.

No, no, no.

Keep going, keep going.

Okay.

And then I'm doing a little dance on top of the bar.

Sure.

A bar.

Okay.

And then I tell you what else happens.

Yeah.

Tell me what else happens because I really want to see the act here.

And then he puts the banana peel right under me and I slip.

Where do I slip?

Where?

A little to the left.

Oh, standing O, standing O and the O stands for Ovation.

Oh my God.

People go insane.

So I saw that obviously I saw that and I was like I want a piece of that.

I get it just from the final 30 seconds.

I mean that's amazing.

Well I tell you, you in about two to six hundred other men said I want to piece of that in the early 2000s and late nineties and Arizona.

You said that in Arizona?

No, no, that wasn't me.

I did not say that in Arizona.

We did not meet there.

No, we met here in beautiful.

Okay.

I just want to make sure.

I've only known him a couple weeks.

And I've just met Martin Star and I'll tell you how I love him.

Okay.

You just met him today or you know really.

Right now.

Just a second.

Oh, Martin.

Hey, Turd.

That's an interesting name by the way, Turd.

Is it a nickname?

It's my stage thing.

Your stage thing.

What is your real name?

I won't reveal.

Okay.

No one's talk or is it?

His real name is Johnny Depp.

And Johnny, wait, not the Johnny Depp.

Obviously not the Johnny Depp.

No, but look, I think I like it.

Is it Depp with one pee?

No.

You make me sick.

Sometimes it's just why we had to change his name.

Oh, okay.

Because it's like a tag.

Yeah.

Okay.

There's another Johnny Depp out there.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yes.

And your parents, the Depp's.

Yeah.

Well, Linda and Terry Depp.

And they're from Texas?

No.

Well, my daddy is from, I think he is a Navy Brat.

You think he is.

You don't have confirmation on this.

I do not.

I don't know him very well.

You don't.

And how well do you know him?

I know his name.

Okay.

Terry Depp.

And I know that some of his genes are in me.

Some of his genes?

His DNA.

No.

I grabbed a pair of his cut off shorts.

Shuck him up my bottle.

And wear off your bottle.

Okay.

I'll beat you to it.

Okay.

Oh, God.

It is an oxygen deprived in this room.

Yeah, it really is.

But what about Melinda?

You knew her pretty well.

Yes.

She raised me.

First we were in St. Louis.

And she would put me on these little go-karts.

And she would race me around.

I didn't know how to talk.

So she raised you and raised you?

Yes.

Okay.

And she raised you like your pencil act, right?

I don't have a single comedy routine about a pencil.

Why are you dressed like that, Ben?

I don't know what you're talking about.

What do you mean?

We talked about it earlier.

Well, I know that I'm in my cute little yellow number.

And it is.

And you said that you dressed like a pencil because of the act.

Oh, yes.

Suppose I did.

Well, that was a little joke.

Oh, it's a joke.

You're just coincidentally looked like a pencil today.

It's just an outfit.

Yeah.

God, you're just...

Hey, don't be mean.

Yeah, don't be mean to me.

Well, he's pushing me around.

Scott's a very important part of the entertainment industry here.

And you need to stand up.

Why did you say here?

You can just...

I'm in...

I'm sorry, are you?

In LA and in Hollywood.

Yeah, in Hollywood.

Okay, but internationally as well.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

But all the entertainment comes from here.

So if you're a big deal, here you have a big deal.

Are you a producer in Ukraine?

I hear that she did a lot of movies out there.

Oh, yeah, they do.

Blade, Blade, too.

Blade and Blade, too.

Blade Trinity was Vancouver.

Yeah, exactly.

I haven't seen them.

I haven't owned a DVD player in years.

You have, well, you're out on the streets.

How do you entertain yourself out on the streets?

Oh, I talked all the crazies.

I am...

I fucking suck anyone in the game.

Wait, so how much money do you have from fucking and sucking?

About 68 grand.

What?

I'm thinking about doing a damn payment.

A damn payment where?

On a house?

Yeah, just from fucking sucking.

Yeah, you should call all cash.

That's why he has the...

Well, it's a cash business.

It's a cash business.

No, I have the...

He's from you, you big sweetie.

Well, yeah, but the reason why you haven't used these not how you got them.

Yeah.

God, you're so fucking literal.

Number two.

Oh, turd.

Turd.

Turd, duckweed.

All right.

What do you think of that?

I think those guys are having a great time.

And you wish to were a part of it.

Of course I do.

You wish you were there.

The first one, Classic Jarl stopped by.

That's right.

Yes.

So you were represented on that one.

That was represented on that one.

Established in the Classic Jarl's lore, was that he's number 12 on the...

Oh, yeah, very weirdly.

What is going on with Classic Jarl's?

He has not been by lately.

No, I guess, yeah, his schedule just didn't sync up.

Classic Jarl's of course is someone that you, if you are recording your own show in the other studio.

That's right.

And you find out the comedy bang bang is recording.

You will burst in.

Yes.

And do this character which is only done for this purpose.

He is solely an interrupting character.

Mm-hmm.

And mainly because his voice is very difficult to do.

He is very difficult.

He has a collapsed lung.

No?

He's a fencing instructor.

I know that.

He's a fencing instructor.

He's very patriotic and very religious.

He has the opening to his throat is too small.

Oh, right.

It's very difficult for him to push words out.

Right, right, right.

He also has very soft teeth, which makes it difficult for him to eat a lot of food.

Right.

Yeah.

Okay.

And also his tiny windpipe makes it very difficult.

He's not very briefly and yet we know so much about him.

Yeah.

It's a little more every time.

Mm-hmm.

I'd love to hear from him.

My favorite thing about doing Jarl's is that I will often be walking in on a room full of people I don't know.

Like I'll know maybe one or two people.

And they will not know you and wonder what you're doing.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So it's exciting.

It's a real high wire act.

Oh, it is.

It's a lot like that.

What was that movie where Joseph Gordon Levitt from Thorough Rock from the Sun?

Yeah.

Go.

You're thinking of the movie based on the documentary Man on Wire and the movie version of it was called Wire Man.

Other guy on different wire.

That's right.

50-50 chance of falling down to the ground.

All right.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we're going to have two number ones.

Your number one live episode and your number one regular episode of the year.

Getting exciting.

Shit, motherfucker.

Snuts.

Here we go.

Let's take a break.

We'll be right back with Comedy Bang Bang.

Comedy Bang Bang, Paul F.

Paul of Tomkins is here with me and this is exciting.

We're going to do our number one live episode of the year of the tour.

This is exciting.

I'm very, I'm very curious to see what people.

Let's hear it.

This is your number one.

Number one.

All right.

You're curious as to what you think people voted the best live episode of the year is.

What?

What is your favorite?

As to what I think people voted.

I'm curious as to what people voted.

You're not curious about what you think.

I would be if I were you.

I wish I could compartmentalize my thoughts so well.

Then I'm like, I wonder what I think about this.

I'm curious to find out all my memory palace.

What is your favorite episode of the ones that we did?

My favorite episode of the tour.

Favorite stop was Atlanta.

That was my favorite episode of the whole tour.

Why is that?

I did a new character.

You did the contraption air.

I did the contraption air.

It was exciting to do a new character and...

Lauren did Ho-Ho.

An old favorite.

That crowd was amazing.

Drew Tarver was there with us.

He did Donnie Gary, which I had never seen before, and just delighted me to know end.

We had a nice dinner that night.

Nice dinner and the venue was exciting to be here.

The venue was so great.

The tabernacle in Atlanta.

So great.

They treated us really well.

Drew's family was there.

Drew's family was there and got to see him destroy in front of a crowd.

Destroy!

He killed.

Happened twice to us.

Neil Campbell, when his parents were there, gave one of the best shows of his.

Three times.

Oh, that's right.

Because your family was there in Philadelphia.

And you did the...

It doesn't matter.

I can't remember every family that comes home.

No, it's okay.

You couldn't remember...

Look, let's be honest.

I'm thinking of us as like old guard where something like that...

For the kids.

It's for the kids.

That's what I'm thinking of.

I guess.

So let's reveal what the number one episode is.

May 11th.

Never forget.

Atlanta!

The listeners voted for our favorite tour episode.

I was curious to see what I would think about it.

And now, like, three hundred thousand years out of time.

Because you know what you thought about it.

I like it.

That's right.

This is the Atlanta tour stop.

Just everything was just working really well.

Me, the contraption error and I talked for a good long time.

And then Ho Ho came out.

It was very funny.

And then Donnie Gary came out.

And...

It was a very Georgia-themed episode.

It was.

Because the contraption error is a Georgia character from Savannah, Georgia.

You were born in Savannah, Georgia.

And drew us from Georgia.

That's right.

And he was visiting his family there.

And we were in Georgia.

That's the final piece of the puzzle.

So we're going to hear...

First we're going to hear Ho Ho.

Ho Ho came out first.

And then the contraption error comes out.

And then we are going to hear Donnie Gary comes out.

So enjoy this.

This is the top number one episode, live episode of the year.

This is your number one.

Good work everybody.

Number one.

So Ho Ho you are...

Ho Ho.

Yes, of course.

Ho Ho you are...

You are...

Yeah.

Ho Ho.

Eight.

Don't try to chick me.

You're a little elf from the North Pole who works for Santa.

I work for Santa, but I kind of do my own thing.

I deliver toys to the bad girls and boys.

I bring them guns.

And knives.

Because bad little girls and boys from Santa they get...

Cold.

That's a piece of shit, man.

They still deserve something cool.

Although in this energy crisis...

Oh.

What a snooze.

So instead of a rock in their stocking or whatever they get, you go around.

Do you do it on the day after Christmas or do you do it on...

No, I do it on the night before Christmas just like Santa.

So does Santa come first?

Yeah, he always has to.

He's very selfish.

Then you finish yourself off.

Yeah, well I go to Mrs. Claus.

Yum yum.

So Santa goes through the homes of every...

He creeps around your house.

Watch as you sleep for a while.

Does he turn on your TV and go through your Tivo?

Yeah, he likes to see what you're watching.

Make sure you weren't being naughty and watching bad stuff.

Like what's bad stuff?

Homeland.

So if you're watching a homeland...

You're getting cold.

And this is something I've wondered.

Does Santa...

Does he...

Actually, if a home...

Let me just phrase it this way.

If a woman is barren...

Mm-hmm.

I follow.

And childless.

Got it.

Not by choice, but by nature.

Oh, okay.

Where is this going?

Does Santa go to their homes or...?

Hey, he visits little kids.

What do you think?

Does Santa come to your house?

Or you don't know.

You're wondering because you're sleeping.

I have no idea.

He likes to go visit little kids.

He goes...

Okay, so there are certain houses Santa never goes...

Yeah, of course.

Okay, because he can't hit every house.

Well, that would be impossible.

Yeah.

So you then...

He comes around.

He does his business.

Yeah, I hide in his sack.

So you're there with him.

Yeah.

So you're hiding in his sack just like a little toy.

Yeah.

Has he ever accidentally given you to a little boy or girl underneath the tree?

Yeah, I lived with him for four years.

And what were their names?

Tim, Lisa.

Was it Tool Time Tim Taylor?

Yeah.

Who?

We're first barf.

So you then, while he's sort of going about his business, you know, hitching up the reindeer, does he unhitch the reindeer every single...

No, they can't be trusted.

Okay, so...

They'll run away.

They'll run...

Really?

Does he enslave them?

Yeah.

They don't want to be doing what they're doing?

No!

What's all that malarkey we hear about Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer wants to lead this lay and all that?

He just wants something good to do with his life that's already gone to hell.

He's trapped in the North Pole.

And are they eternally young?

Yeah, they don't grow...

No one on the North Pole ages.

Really?

What age did you start off at Volvo?

Well, take a guess.

Base on my skin.

My butt skin.

Oh, I see.

I'm showing you.

Well, the rings around your anus tell me that you're about...

Looks to be about 5,000 years old.

You got that right!

As old as the Earth.

Well, interesting.

I was the first thing...

The Earth was formed and I was inside.

I am never sad for I'm always thinking of new contraptions in my brain.

What are you thinking of right now?

Well, right now...

I'm thinking of a contraption that would free young...

Who's against?

From the inside of abandoned refrigerators which they persist in playing inside of and upon.

And not miniature refrigerators.

And not mini fridge boxes.

No, these are full-size refrigerators...

Yeah.

That maybe you could fold a Lisa mattress in half and cram it in there...

If you take out all the shelves...

And of course, the produce that you have stored within it.

That's another good slogan.

Lisa mattress, don't crawl into our box and die.

That's what she said.

Well, you got me there.

She did say it and we had to address it.

So you're thinking of a contraption to release these hooligans from these refrigerators.

Yes, I am.

And what would it...

I mean, do you know the mechanism yet?

I can almost see it very clearly.

I know that marbles would be involved.

I think a ringing alarm clock.

And I am guessing some sort of waterfowl on a tether.

Do you ever, like, go to the machine shop and make parts for any of your contraptions?

Oh, the machine shop, he says.

I will forgive you, your adorable naivete, my friend.

The machine shop is no friend to the contraption ale.

Because then it would turn into an invention.

It would turn into a machine, do you see?

Machines and contraptions are two entirely different things.

Are you worried somehow about machines rising up?

Is that why you don't want something to be a machine?

That will never happen, my friend.

Really?

The machines will never rise up because the machines lack a thing that is essential for rising up against human beings.

And that is a soul.

A machine does not know that it is sad.

It just knows that it has to perform certain tasks.

So meanwhile, humans are sad.

We're sad all the time.

We're a very sad race of creatures.

What a strange applause.

I'm very sad, yeah.

My life is horrible.

I believe it was Shakespeare himself who said, what a piece of work is man.

Maybe he was talking about a contraption.

He was talking about a human being.

Yes, but that human being being a piece of work.

Do you see what I'm saying?

No, you're talking about like a man.

He was saying people are contraptions.

Anyway, I don't want to spit hands with you.

I just want to impress upon you that my passion is making contraptions.

And if I could, what I would love to do is once again slip the circle of the machine.

Slip the surly bonds of earth and travel to outer space in a contraption of my own making.

You say once again?

It happened once by accident.

This is like Philadelphia all over again.

Are you trying to say that you have penetrated the inky blackness of outer space?

Yes, sir.

In a contraption of your devising.

In a contraption of my devising.

I did not even intend for this contraption to go as far as it did.

My soul desire, my goal was to get high enough up into space that I could take a photograph of my beloved, Savannah, Georgia.

See it as our Lord does see it from on high in the celestial heavens.

Aren't there like astronaut pictures that exist?

Yeah, just google it.

Oh, may I ask you a question?

Did I take those?

I don't know.

Why would you bother taking a picture at all if there's Google as you say?

Because you're taking a picture of something that there isn't a picture of like your own birthday party.

Right, I see.

So everyone, if anyone's ever taken a picture of you, you should forbid anyone else forever taking a picture of you again, it's been done.

Hey, if you go into the Grand Canyon, one of the Earth's most natural wonders and awe-inspiring spectacle, throw your camry in the trash can.

This is a sound argument.

I am being sarcastic for the sake of those audience members who are about slower on the uptake than we might be.

You're super condescending.

I am a monster.

Not only to me, but to all of them.

Well, now, you will forgive me.

I do not mean to condescend.

I am merely trying to elucidate my position vis-a-vis the photographic arts.

Donnie Gary.

Yes.

Such a legend.

Yeah.

I've been all around the world.

And, finally, you guys may have seen a little bit about me in the news.

Right now, I am currently in trouble for tax evasion.

Oh, no.

It's terrible.

Yeah.

Five million dollars in debt.

Five million dollars.

Five million dollars in debt right now.

Well, now that is quite a sum of monies, though.

Yes.

I mean, it's a low amount of millions.

That is true.

So that's on the bright side.

There could be 999 million.

That's the most million.

Yes.

So, most millions, 999 million.

No, you could have a thousand millions.

No, that's one billion.

It switches over to one billion.

Flips a switch.

Yep.

It becomes one billion.

Lucky for me, I'm only five million.

That is lucky.

How'd you get to debt?

Well, I was not aware you had to pay taxes.

Oh.

I did not know that the country needs money to run.

But, Mr. Gary, you are saying that in the entirety of your life, you remain ignorant of the ideal of federal income taxes.

I thought that roads were made by good Samaritans.

But I see these gentlemen out there working, and I was like, that's mighty kind to them.

We needed this road.

But, Mr. Gary, when you...

Oh, you overcome with emotion.

No.

Oh, my goodness.

He's crying.

Wipe the tears, please, please.

Sorry.

It's sentimental.

I cry thinking about all those people working at the post office for free.

You've gone to an amusement park, certainly, in your life.

Yes.

It's a good place to stop.

Of course you have.

There's a perfect place to stop to illustrate the idea of taxes.

You've paid to get into Disneyland, I would imagine.

No, no.

I sneak in inside of a stranger's stroller.

But you know you're sneaking in, so you know the concept of that it costs money.

Yes, but I knew that was a private enterprise.

As opposed to public, which is paid for by...

Nobody.

LAUGHTER LAUGHTER So you hadn't thought this through?

Yes.

No, I now know.

But at the time, I was living the high life, sure, in the 70s.

You're an older gentleman.

Yes, I'm 64 years old, yes.

Wow.

Your music's amazing.

Thank you so much.

Yeah, actually, I have a new album coming out.

You do?

I do, yes.

Yeah, yeah, thank you very much.

Fantastic.

When does this drop?

It's going to drop as soon as I can get it recorded and produced.

LAUGHTER What's your new album about?

Well, you know, a lot of this recent misfortune has inspired a lot of beautiful new music.

Well, from tragedy, sometimes...

Grows a song.

As the old expression does go.

That's true.

Yeah, I would love to maybe try out a couple of songs on you guys.

Oh, wow, with the audience like to hear something like that.

Wow, wow.

You might have an event.

This is amazing.

My big concert.

Hit it, baby.

Oh.

Oh, yeah.

Girl, you know how every time you go to McDonald's, they charge you $1.50 for a soda.

What did you know that if you hold on to that cup and you bring it back with you every time you go to McDonald's, you can have all the free soda you can drink.

I reuse McDonald's cups.

Yeah, I don't ever pay for soda.

I'm talking infinite refills on pound soda.

Yeah.

I'm the expander and box root beer.

Two sodas for the price of one.

Yeah.

Oh, thank you.

That was good.

Number one.

Oh, I love hearing it again like I was there yesterday.

Good stuff.

I wish we could do a top 15 of the live episodes.

I wish so too.

But we could only do four.

Why, who made that rule?

Me too.

Good shit though.

Huh?

Fun tour.

Will we do a tour again ever?

I don't know.

It's a lot of work and a lot of time.

But very rewarding, I think, not only in terms of seeing the fans, but also an artistic, I think, achievement to do that many episodes.

It was very challenging in a great way.

Mm-hmm.

In a great way.

I really enjoyed the pressure of having to come up with new stuff every show.

Yeah.

And there were, I had a couple duds along the way where I was like, where I learned from that experience.

I did too, but I thought, but I did, I really did feel like it was a learning experience where I, every step along the way, I was like, oh, I'm getting better at this part of it.

And it really was one of those things where I felt like the entire tour.

And it wasn't like we started slow and ended strong.

It was maybe the reverse.

No, it was.

No, but it was, you know, I mean, that first episode, it got a lot of votes, by the way.

The live from the Ace Hotel.

Yeah, that was a good one.

I got a lot of votes didn't crack the top four, but that was a great one.

And then we just went on that tour.

I mean, you know, it probably was a mistake for me to go from ending my TV show.

The last day was the day before the Ace Hotel show, and then two days later on a plane.

That was dumb.

Shouldn't have done that.

Live and learn.

Yeah.

But I mean, we only had a small window that we could do it.

And I said, I would rather go immediately from the TV show into.

Also, I think the TV schedule had changed somewhat too.

That maybe those things were not going to be quite so close together.

Yeah.

It just kind of happened that way.

But yeah, I really enjoyed it.

That said, I do not think that we're doing it next year.

Oh, I'm not for sure.

Yeah.

And maybe, I mean, maybe some festival dates along the way, but not an actual tour.

That's it.

I do believe that you should do a spontaneous nation tour.

We'll see.

I feel like last year was, this past year was so much travel that I'm not in any hurry to take that on.

Did you do 39 bang bang dates, but you did a lot of you did thrilling adventure.

Yeah, there was a lot of stuff going on.

And it was all fun.

It was all fun, but I think I, you know, you got to manage your time.

Yeah, yeah.

Exactly.

So let's take a year off and then reassess and then make more things.

Yes.

Exactly.

And who knows?

Maybe in 2018, no one will care about comedy bang bang anymore.

And we'll be like, I can't believe anyone ever came to a tour that anyway.

I fully expect my career to be over in a matter of weeks.

Really?

What's happening?

I don't know.

But I wouldn't be surprised.

All right.

Let's take a break.

When we come back, this is exciting.

The number one episode of the year boy.

What could it be?

I know it is.

You do know it is?

Yeah.

How did you know?

You want me to just say?

Yeah.

Did you hack into my emails?

Yeah.

Oh, damn it.

Yeah.

All right.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang.

I'm doing it.

This is it.

We're here with Paul of Tomkins and we are going to be balls deep in a second.

B-D.

Wouldn't you?

In a sec.

B-B-D in a hot sec.

Oh, we're so close.

We're so close to being balls deep.

Do you know that song Last Christmas I gave you my heart?

Yeah, sure.

I know it first.

You gave it away?

Yeah.

So like now he has to date?

Yeah.

What is this weird arrangement?

We've been enslaved.

Yeah.

I guess we're dating now.

What?

Oh, wait.

Yeah.

I got your heart from this asshole.

It seems unfair.

Oh, well.

But hey, a gift isn't.

What about threw it away?

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

George.

One more pass.

Although it doesn't sound as musical.

I threw it out.

You threw it.

It doesn't sound as good.

You told us to.

It's the bin.

Terrible.

All right, guys.

This is it.

We are at it.

This is our number one.

I can't believe this.

Number one.

I can't believe it.

I can't believe it either.

This is the number one episode of the year voted by you, the listening public.

And we had a lot of great episodes this year.

And I believe every once in a while.

An episode will get a lot of votes because it's, and I've talked about this on previous best ofs.

It has a very easy to understand title that is representative of what the episode is.

And people like the episode, but it's easier to vote for something when it has a simple title where you go, oh, yeah, that episode.

I love that one.

Remember exactly what it was.

Weirdly enough, almost mandatory.

No way of even knowing what that episode was.

I've already forgotten what it was.

Yeah, it was Jason Manzoukas and Thomas Miller.

There we go.

No idea what is in that episode or why it's called almost mandatory.

And yet it got a lot of votes.

So maybe my theory is for nothing.

But this is an episode from March 7th, episode 406.

So boy, right after 400, 401, 402.

I mean, that stretch was a really good stretch.

This is an episode called Kid Detectives 2.

Okay.

What is wrong?

That's funny.

It's your, no, you didn't make the number one episode this year.

That's cool.

Hey, man.

It's great.

You're the number one live episode.

Sure.

You can, and you're the number three, you're on the number three.

Number three.

And you've been on this countdown now, what, eight times?

You know, that's great.

I apologize.

No, right.

Nothing apologized for.

You don't have to apologize for anything.

Look, you know, try harder next year.

I wish I could make more effort.

I wish I could.

But it's just physically impossible.

It's physically impossible.

I have to say that so many of the live episodes would have beaten a bunch of the top 15 episodes.

Don't you think?

No doubt.

If all of them were just, if everyone heard all of them and it was just comparing.

Yeah, there'd be a parade for me.

I don't know about that, but I would say that a lot of those live episodes that we said would have cracked the title.

I know.

I know that there would have been a parade for me.

Okay.

All right.

This kid detectives too, this is Lauren Lapkis and Thomas Middleditch.

And I got to say one thing to give a little shout out to Thomas Middleditch, he did four episodes this year.

All he did were four episodes.

One live and three in studio.

His three in studio were voted on by all of you in the top five.

And his one live episode was in the top three of the live episodes.

So what are you trying to say?

You're looking at me saying this.

I'm just saying that he was like an assassin.

By the way, I have to look at you when I'm talking to you.

We're not playing Paul or Cody video.

It was great though when we did.

It was really good.

It was a good round.

But what a record.

I mean, that's like batting a thousand in a way.

You know what I mean?

Must be satisfying.

Let's go to this.

Stop this character.

We're celebrating.

No!

We're celebrating these people.

Let's celebrate Thomas because I don't think he's been celebrated enough.

This poor guy.

Let's give him a break.

Let finally let this be a good thing in his life.

Come on.

You and I have been Thomas Middleditch fans for a long time.

We saw- I love them in front since I am by and provide Shakespeare company.

And provide Shakespeare company.

We saw them many years ago.

All those guys are great.

That's right.

So when- and here's another fact.

When I did Bonnaroo, the Bonnaroo Festival, we did a live sort of hybrid stand-up comedy bang bang and improvised comedy bang bang thing with James Adomian and Thomas Lennon and Reggie to celebrate the second season of the TV show.

When I did Bonnaroo, all the improvised Shakespeare guys were there and said hi to them.

You know, I've been seeing them at a few festivals and I was always saying oh guys I think you guys are so funny.

But I did not know Thomas.

Really other than hey, you're in this improvised Shakespeare Festival, you probably don't know my work.

We somehow in the Bonnaroo Festival, we had to leave it for in the morning to get to our play.

Okay?

And so we all gathered in the hotel lobby.

And I tell you, the after party was still going on in there.

That made me so tired.

But it was 4 a.m.

And our car does not come.

The Bonnaroo person that they sent the intern, the Bonnaroo intern does not come.

For 30 doesn't come.

At 4.30 I call the helpline that they give you.

Guess what isn't working at 4 in the morning?

The helpline?

In order to help you with your travel arrangements, that's right.

Probably the person who meant to helpline was two feet away from you at the bar.

Probably.

So no one's answering and we're like we are going to miss our plane.

By the way, this is in the middle of Tennessee I believe Bonnaroo is right.

And I do not know.

Okay.

And this is in the middle of nowhere kind of and not a place where cabs are.

And to call a cab, we tried calling a cab and they were like we can get there in like 45 minutes.

Oh my God.

So and no one will answer the helpline and lo and behold, we see Thomas come down the stairs.

It's like 4.45 in the morning.

He's going to the airport, not through a Bonnaroo, but HBO because he's on Silicon Valley has hired him a car in order to get him back to the set as soon as possible.

And there are like five of us.

And we say, and I don't know him and I'm like, Thomas, do you think, are you going to the airport?

Do you think you could take all of us in your HBO car?

Right.

And he was like, of course.

And we all jumped into the car.

Super nice.

We got to the airport in time and did not miss the flight.

So that's a little Thomas story, but because I was reminded of the improvised Shakespeare festival, we're big fan of his.

If anyone.

Improvising your company.

Company.

Yes.

This is a company.

Yes.

This group of guys that are really great at doing this thing.

It's not like a big event where they are just to give them proper credit.

Yes, exactly.

It's like how many people are in at five or?

I think like there's a.

Total, I think it's like maybe six to eight guys.

I've been on their website recently.

Yeah.

There's like a rotating group of people.

And they do four at a time when they do a show.

Right, right.

It's one of the greats.

I think we've talked about it.

If you're ever at a festival or where they're putting on a show a great night at the theater and you'll laugh a lot and I went in a little skeptical kind of going, how good can this actually be?

Yeah.

Improvise Shakespeare and not only do they nail the humor part of it, but they also do such specific things to Shakespeare.

It's incredible.

It's really incredible.

So, if anyone can be on a big popular HBO show, I'm glad that one of those guys is so good on him.

What a record this year, four episodes and all four of them in the top five.

This is Kid Detectives 2, the sequel to Kid.

Oh, we didn't even do the clip.

No, we haven't.

This is the sequel to the Kid Detectives episode where Lauren and Thomas just improvised these young characters.

And so let's hear it.

This is a crazy episode.

They are of course JJ and Murphy O'Malley-Man and they are child detectives.

That's all you need to say.

Here we go.

This is your number one of the year.

Number one.

So what is the new case?

I want to hear about this case.

Oh, boy.

Ah, jeez.

Well, it all started when a crying mother came to us that her babies had been stolen.

Yeah.

Babies.

She knocked on her door crying saying her babies were stolen.

She was cradling air.

Yeah.

She said everything was going normal.

I was at the hospital.

I shit up my pussy.

Wait, wait, wait.

And then the turds turned into babies and then they were gone.

Yeah.

Okay, hold on, hold on.

So was she trying to explain the concept of childbirth to you and you didn't understand it?

No, no, she just was explaining where she was and what happened.

Oh, this is verbatim.

Yeah.

Well, Scott, you do know that a girl gets pregnant, then poops out her pussy.

And then the turds turned into little babies and that's you and me.

I really wish you wouldn't say the word or that word.

You know, use him.

What word?

Put a pussy.

He's afraid to say it.

What a virgin.

Wait, are you not a virgin?

No way.

I'm 11 now.

Okay.

I'm 11 too.

Who have you had sex with?

My sister.

Okay.

Hold on.

I don't want to talk about this.

Okay.

New topic.

So this woman- Don't you want to know what we thought of it?

Yeah, don't you want to know our review?

All right, guys.

What'd you think of it?

Quickly.

We don't have a lot of time to get into this.

I thought pretty good.

Could use some work.

Yeah, ditto.

Well, you guys are new with this.

Well, we had fun.

It was pretty comfortable.

I guys know each other really well, so it's not that- Yeah.

I mean, I wasn't embarrassed in my body or anything.

Okay.

All right.

Enough of that.

All right.

Let's- That's not why you're here.

Yeah, and this new- I thought it was really nice.

We hugged at the end.

We watched a movie right after.

Yeah, what movie?

Yeah, Fern Gully.

Fern Gully.

Was that a legend?

Yeah.

Of course.

You think it really happened?

Oh, man.

Your brain's weird.

Yeah.

More like mush.

All right, guys.

So let's get to why you're here.

No, I mean, why you're here is Ireland.

Let's get to- Okay.

So we knew she had a real problem, and we had to figure it out.

So we immediately got our notebooks, our caps, our little glasses, and our galosh is on, in case anything started to rain.

Yeah, in case anything started to rain.

Okay.

Yeah.

What else has started to rain in your experience other than the sky?

My mommy's pussy.

Oh, my God.

Guys.

It's true.

I had to get an umbrella.

Yeah.

Okay, guys.

This is... I'm starting to regret this is not that kind of a show.

It's not?

Who's your daddy?

Don't bring him up.

Why? At the last time we talked he was still around.

Yeah, well he is no good.

Yeah, what happened?

He told us he got some lady pregnant.

Really?

Yeah.

What lady?

I don't know.

Some girl, you know?

Said she's gonna have twins.

Yeah.

Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

What are you saying?

Are these cases connected?

Huh?

What do you think you are, gumshoe?

Yeah.

Back off the beat.

You smoking grass in your butt?

In my butt.

That gets you high faster.

Yeah, well that's probably true.

We know, we've been toking since forever.

If you can puff in with your butt, you're an expert toaker.

Yeah, I've seen it online.

My favorite website that I watched before bed is a little website called effock.com.

E-F-U-K-T dot com.

Everything on there is super fucked.

Alright, they're gonna appreciate the plug.

But guys, look, I think these cases are connected.

I mean, your daddy said he got someone pregnant who was gonna have twins.

This woman just had twins and they're missing.

Twins.

Two.

Two kids.

You and me.

Are we her babies?

No, no, you're not her babies.

Wait, wait, wait.

We were stolen?

How long ago did this woman say it happened?

Um, about 11 years ago.

12 years ago?

Wait, 11.

One, one, two, twins.

Twins.

Two kids.

We gotta go to Alaska.

We do.

I knew it.

I told you it was in Alaska.

What does two have to do with Alaska?

Oh my god.

Have I seen the shape of Alaska?

It looks like the silver too.

With a big bubble and swirly lines around it.

Yeah, plus there's only two big mountains there.

Yeah, and only two types of snow.

Yeah, white and brown.

What about yellow?

Yellow is brown.

Oh, okay.

That's the same tone palette.

Yeah, oh, guys, like you've never even been to the Home Depot and looked at the color swatches.

I don't know what to do with this guy.

Oh, man.

Hey, stick to hosting radio.

Yeah, stick to your radio data.

I am sticking to it.

I'm doing it right now.

You are?

Yeah.

Are we on the radio?

Whoa, hello.

Hello out there.

Cool.

Wow, I heard my echo.

Nito.

So wait, I thought that you're okay.

So this happened.

A woman walked in.

Yeah.

Well, she knocked on the door.

Yeah.

Up our bedroom.

She's not.

Yeah.

Okay.

So she was soaking away from the rain or a shower.

It took us a minute to get our clothes on.

Yeah.

Because we were kind of in the middle of something.

That was the day we did it.

Oh, dear.

For the first time of many.

Yeah.

We love doing it.

All right.

Okay.

So we love each other.

So this is not.

What?

Don't you have sex with your wife?

I do, but you guys are not your brothers.

And I think you might be twins.

I think you might be the same age.

Don't you ever jerk off in the mirror?

Why?

Because it's like looking in the mirror.

We look the same.

Yeah.

It's like seeing what you look like when you're jerking off.

Don't you ever curious?

Guys, this is not what the show is about.

Okay.

This is, I'm trying to get to the bottom of your history here.

Look, why do you think that there are clues in Alaska, by the way?

Before we get to the Ireland family, you want the truth.

Yeah.

You want the absolute truth with no beans about it?

Yeah.

No BS, no filter.

All right.

The unvarnished truth.

Yeah.

The truth is we heard our papap was going all the way up there.

Really?

Yeah.

He's taking a car.

Taking a car all the way.

Yeah, that's a long drive, but you can get there.

And the truth is, he told us something in our ears, right before he left.

Yeah, really.

Real close, so it was hot and a little wet.

He said, I'm going to Alaska.

Is that your impression of your dad?

Yeah.

Is he an old prospector?

Yeah, it sounds like a...

Did he learn to speak from listening to the big Thunder Mountain Railroad?

Yeah.

Safety announcement.

Yeah, and you know why he goes at this?

Yeah, you don't want to.

He's only got one tooth in the front and the top and one tooth in the front and the bottom.

Yeah.

And those teeth, he says, those are his gold testing teeth.

He takes a little nug of gold and he puts it in his mouth and he tastes it.

He says 100% pure just by tasting.

Just by tasting.

And chompy in between the two teeth.

Chomp, chomp, chomp.

Man, we sure do miss our old pap.

How often does this come up that he's testing gold?

More than you'd expect.

Well, first thing he tested was Mommy's wedding ring.

Really?

And she died.

Okay, so he tested it before she died and what were the results?

He tested it after she died.

When it was off her muscled body.

Yeah, muscled body.

Yeah, I mean, we had to have some help taking all our valuables off her body.

The skin went off but the valuables stayed on.

Yeah, he also took out her gold fillings.

Yeah.

Chomp, chomp, chomp.

He's mainly chewing on someone else's teeth.

But first the wedding ring he jumped on that and it was 100% tin.

It bit right in his mouth, right between the two teeth.

Then he put it on his front teeth like a tooth ring.

Yeah, I mean, man, our mom sure was a cheapskate.

Wait, she bought her own wedding ring?

Yeah, she insisted.

I mean, we weren't there for it.

That's just what our dad said.

Legend has it.

That's just what our awesome dad said.

I miss dad.

I love the way he plays with us.

Yeah.

Doing a jig around us?

Yeah, spreading salt around us in a circle and consulting the bones.

You remember consulting the bones?

It's our favorite game.

Screw life, screw monopoly, we play, consult the bones.

Let's play right now.

Okay.

You brought bones?

Yeah.

Okay.

Scott, Scott, Scott, man.

What do you want to know about your future?

Yeah.

When will I perish?

Okay.

Whoa.

Are you sure you want to know?

Yeah, what do the bones say?

It doesn't look good, sir.

Two, two bones.

So wait, let me first explain to the listeners.

We had 12 bones.

All the bones fell off the table except for two.

Oh my gosh.

They went into an X.

X marks the spot.

Two.

You're going to die in 2017.

We're going to get hit by two cars running alongside each other.

You'll be laying on the ground long ways like a hot dog.

Yeah.

And then you'll run you over.

Oh my gosh.

The spirits come out of me.

And just because two bones are there, you think it's 2017?

It could be 2018, I mean it could be 2019 as far as you know.

No, sir.

We're the ones who know how to read the bones.

Oh, sorry.

Have you ever consulted the bones first?

I've never consulted.

Who's bones are those?

Do you mind me asking?

You don't want to know.

We do mind.

I actually do want to know and I'm going to insist upon asking.

You want me to consult the bones to find out?

To find out who's bones they are?

Okay, sure.

Oh, no.

Oh, man.

What's it say?

Okay.

These bones are President Barack Obama's.

What?

You know where he lives.

Where's he live?

How many bones are on the table?

The next clue is in Alaska.

Wait, I don't think so.

Is there a four Washington Lane in Alaska?

No, but we just know that what it means that.

Where did you get these bones?

Well, Michelle Obama called us up and said we had to hide these.

Yeah, she said we got a little bit too carried away.

And guess what they are?

Which bones are they?

Finger bones.

He's still alive.

He just doesn't have real fingers.

Really does he have just like a floppy skin glove?

You call it floppy floppies.

Yeah.

My favorite movie that I like to watch before bed is The Road.

Do you remember the scene in the basement?

We got those half eaten people.

Sure, yeah.

Well, Michelle's been talking about how she wanted to recreate that with Obama.

Okay.

I've been wondering why he hasn't pointed at anything in the last two years.

He's embarrassed.

Yeah.

It would look really foolish if you ever tried to point with one of those things.

Oh man, little floppy skin flaps.

Yeah, he just like sort of like.

Yeah, he waves people.

Guys, what is it?

What was your home life like?

Were you born in a home or were you born in a lab?

I mean, I know you were born in a toilet, but where were you raised?

The toilet was in a lab.

Yeah.

Well, we don't really know what you're talking about.

Lab, home, whatever.

Maybe we just describe what we saw growing up and you can tell us where we were.

Yeah, please do.

Okay.

All white.

Metal tables.

Men with coats.

Radioactive turtles.

A rat who taught us martial arts.

Slime.

Pouring down the walls.

Porn.

All access porn.

Little murder shows.

Murder shows.

Little granola bars.

For whenever we did something right.

A maze, maze Wednesdays.

Is that a hit?

Casual Fridays.

Oh, casual.

What'd you get to wear?

Our cash Fridays.

Only jeans.

No tops.

No unders.

No socks and no hats.

Not caught with a cat with a cat or hat on Fridays.

Boy.

Oh man.

Wait, what if the cat in the hat came?

He did on Christmas once.

Really?

Yeah, it was our special.

He came all over the place.

Yeah.

It was great.

Oh yeah.

I miss maze Wednesdays.

Maze Wednesdays and the Sundays when we had to jack off all the cats.

Number one.

Okay.

Kid detectives too.

They did it.

They're insane.

They're insane people.

Lauren, love you.

Wish you had such a great time with you this year.

Wish you weren't in England.

You know, we could be spending the holidays together.

You know what?

I miss Lauren too.

I miss her podcast on Fridays.

Yep.

By the way, if you're a comedy bang bang fan, the very last episode of With Special Guest with Lauren Lapkis was a lot of fun to do.

You and I and Lauren all together in an insane episode that defies description, although many have tried.

And they have all failed.

They're failures.

They go home to their wives.

They're spineless worms.

Oh, their wives know.

I married a failure.

But go check that out.

That was the second anniversary episode.

Generations came out.

Yeah, about a month ago, generations.

That's a really funny episode.

Maybe funnier than any of these episodes we've counted down from on this.

Well, I don't know.

Thomas Middleditch isn't in it.

All right.

That's it.

Is that the end of it?

That's the end of it.

It's fun.

It's fun for a while.

Wow.

Paul, I want to thank you so much.

I know you've been really busy lately and sick.

You've got a sinus infection and I did.

I get to tell end of the year.

It was kind of all caught up with me.

We were traveling so much and you've been filming a million episodes of Bajillion and you've been working and you've been doing your live Largo shows.

And yet, and I know you've been turning down stuff and you've been saying, no, I can't do this, no, I can't do this.

And yet you reached out to me and said, I still have been making time to do the best ups.

Yes.

This was something that I had just always factored into my calendar from, you know, it's just one of those things.

It's a tradition.

Like, of course, we're going to do that.

I enjoyed every year.

I would rather not be doing this with anyone else.

It's something that I look forward to every year and I thank you so much for making time for it.

For all of the guests on the show who have been on all year, I appreciate so much, all of you, donating your time to the show and your genius and coming out here and being super funny every week and the show would not exist without any of you.

For all of the engineers and staff here at Earwolf, a sign with notable exceptions.

Your hard work puts the show out once or twice a week and, you know, we get to record it and just like walk out the door, but these guys have to sit there and snip it together, you know, for hours afterwards.

So I really appreciate that.

And most of all the listeners, I can't believe we've been doing this almost eight years now and people still give a shit.

And not only that, but, you know, we did this live tour to, I believe, 40,000 plus people came out to see us.

So incredible.

The fact that people listen to this every week and enjoy it and care enough to vote on the episodes and get wrapped up in what's going to be number one.

And, you know, it's really meaningful to me that it still holds such a big place in not only people who, and a lot of people write to me and say, I've been listening since the old days at the radio station, but also new listeners every year who are like, I just found out about this.

How have I not listened to it?

It's so gratifying and rewarding to hear from you all.

Thank you so much.

I really appreciate it.

We could do the show without you listening, but why would we?

We would just be recording it and putting it out.

And then we'd look at the statistics and be like, no one's listening to this.

We would stop.

It'd be weird.

It'd be really weird.

It'd be weird.

But I'm not saying we wouldn't do it.

No, I'm sure we would.

Because we're all saying.

We're mentally ill people.

We really are.

And I, as previously established, have a learning disability.

That's right.

I'm imaginary.

Scott, may I say to the listeners how much I appreciate the support that people have given me and the encouragement.

And it is nice to know that the stuff that I do is connecting with someone.

And I'm so grateful to be able to be a part of this show and this family and to work with the people that I've gotten to work with, make new friends and do exciting, creative things with people.

The tour was so much fun.

And we had a lot of people from Bajillion on the show this year who we got to know because of Bajillion.

And people like Ryan and Drew and Tawny and Mandel and Tim and Dan.

And have I left anyone out?

No, I think you got it.

Is that everybody?

Yeah.

You know, they've been on the show a lot this year.

And it's really rewarding to keep meeting these new people and going, oh, wow, look at all these great improvisers and then bringing them into the fold.

And then new people like Zeke and Jessica McKenna, and Ria Butcher was on for the first time this year and has done three episodes.

So it's great to have all these new people.

And then our old favorites like Andy Daley and Nick Grohl who have been on since the very beginning.

It's really cool to be able to work with all these people over a long span of time.

Yeah.

But thank you very much for having me be a part of this because it means a great deal to me.

Of course.

And thank you to the listeners.

It means a lot.

And hopefully you'll listen to us next year when we, we haven't promised to do another iRobot song.

Thank God.

Cause that really came down to the wire.

But we'll talk about Mr. Microphone.

Always.

You can get like clockwork every year.

Please send us any Mr. Microphone minutiae you have.

If you have any news, we need it.

Recent Mr. Microphone news.

We'll see you next week on Monday with another one of our great traditions.

We'll have another Ben Schwartz and Horatio Sands episode.

So looking forward to that.

And who knows what 2017 will bring for us.

Not only personally, but for the show.

Who knows?

We'll see what we'll be counting down to come January.

That's very exciting to me.

Paul, thank you very much.

And listeners, thank you very much.

We'll see you on Monday.

Thanks.

Bye.

This has been an earwolf production, executive produced by Scott Ockerman and Chris Bannon.

I'm going to go back to the next slide.
