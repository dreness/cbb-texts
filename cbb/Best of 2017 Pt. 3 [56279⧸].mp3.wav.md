♪♪♪ Bought the farm chilled the beans, took a rain check and shot the breeze, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang, and thank you to Mondo Mudbud for that catchphrase submission, and may I say...

Happy New Year!

To all the Quaydans be forgot and ever brought to mind, should all the Quaydans be lower for the...

Why are you so... Oh my god, are you yawning in the middle of a song?

Trigger to yawn.

Oh, triggered.

Trigger warning, I yawned.

I yawned.

I yawned. I yawned.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Oh my gosh, and Happy New Year to everybody.

2018, can you believe we made it?

I can't believe it.

Looks like we made it!

I'm helping each other all the way.

Do you say Ebony other on the way?

Yeah, Ebony other on the way.

What else would the lyrics be?

It's the sequel to Ebony and Ivory, in other words.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Song should have sequels more often.

My name is Mia Prequel.

Well, you know what I like is the answer song.

The answer songs are great.

The of course, Papa just wants the best for you.

That's right, Danny, I yellow.

But what are some of the other answer songs that you can think of?

Well, here's this weird about that one.

So, Papa don't preach is, I'm not going to have an abortion.

Right.

And then the death is like, please have an abortion.

I just want the best for you, honey.

No, I have an abortion.

Please have an abortion.

Don't give me a grand song.

Hey!

Hey, by the way, if you're listening to this for the first time, please give us a grand song.

When are you going to give us a grand song?

When are you going to give Paul and Mia grandson?

Do you think people fucked the last couple episodes?

Oh, that's my greatest wish.

The idea of someone having sex.

To my listening to this makes me sick to myself.

Oh, me so horny.

Do you think that song holds up?

I think it does.

I think it's as fresh as the day it was recorded.

Welcome to the show.

This is by the way, best of 2017.

That's right.

It's 2018.

How is that a by the way?

By the way, by the way, maybe the most important thing of all.

By the way, that's kind of like Red Hot Chili Peppers, by the way.

Well, what was he saying?

By the way, I might, wasn't I might be in love with you?

I don't ever want to be.

Love you, baby.

You never go through a chili pepper's face, Paul.

Every morning.

Every goddamn day.

Every morning, you know.

Wake up thinking of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Remelama Ding-Dong.

That's your alarm, right?

Can I tell you, the other day, I shoved your wike in the street just the other day.

Who's lying?

Oh, I was walking down the street just the other day.

I shoved my wike awake.

Awake.

You shoved your wike away?

No, Paul, don't.

I had a wike.

I'd only had it for barely two hours.

Before you just shoved it away.

Shoved it away?

Shoved away, shoved it away from him.

Shoved away, shoved it away.

I shoved her awake because I was having a dream that a Freddy Krueger-like zombie was coming out of.

It was a zombie that also had- Had Freddy Krueger knives or- Freddy Krueger knives.

Or- Freddy Krueger knives.

Both.

Freddy Krueger knives and face.

He looks kind of like that character from Guardians of the Galaxy.

That dude- Vindu or whatever his name is?

The blue- Yeah, what is that guy's name?

Wind- Wind-Blue?

Jer- Maya?

Uh, I think it was like- Wind-Blue?

It might have been- It might have been Wind-Blue?

Might have been Justin-actor, I can't remember.

Oh, Justin- Uh, Justin- Justin- Justin- Justin- Justin- Justin- I mean, it's played by Justin- Right.

But I- This guy was getting closer and closer to me and- I- Little closer.

Mmm.

This dream is heating up.

And he was slashing at me and I shoved him- Right.

And I- You shoved Janie?

I shoved my- I shoved Janie and I heard her cry out.

And she was like, What's wrong?

What's wrong?

And I was fucking freaked out.

Ah, freaked out.

I'd never done that before.

So, paging Dr. Freud, what does this mean?

You consider your- I think my wife is a monster.

To get her away from me.

I agree.

Honestly, I never wanted to say it because- It's- It's tricky when you tell your friend- Something true about that person's wife, but I've always thought that Janie is a monster, yes.

She's a monster and I'm scared.

Can I tell you something I'm proud of?

Yes.

In the dream, the reason I was confronting this monster is because I was giving some time to some older people to get away.

Oh, so you're a hero in your dreams.

In real life, not at all.

I shoved my wife.

We- I- You know, I- I don't know, I've been so uh- irritated with older people like being- Stuck behind them driving or being like stuck behind them on a plane.

Yeah.

I can only imagine if that's- Being stuck behind them in life?

Your parents?

What are they gonna die?

Like, why can't I be older than old people?

When do I get to be the oldest one?

What- Would it- You know, we were talking in one of these last episodes about how things like being in a Star Wars film is something that you never imagined you could ever do.

Yes.

Do you think you will ever get to be the oldest person on Earth?

Like how weird- No, right, yeah, absolutely.

How weird would that be if I were like, I'll have Tomkins now as the oldest person on Earth?

I don't think it'd be that weird.

I think it's going to happen.

And how old do you think you'll be when that happens?

Uh, 97?

97, so okay, so anyone older than uh, Paul is gonna die by 97?

Yes.

Wow.

Yes.

That is too bad to know.

But I hope it happens for- That's for- Too bad to know.

Too bad to know.

That's what I wrote in your- Your book.

You are too bad to know.

The sequel to Bad Know.

The Bad and the Know.

We were talking about too fast.

Too furious at lunch, Paul.

You can't deny it.

That lunch was a mistake, by the way.

Why are you- I think we should have plowed through.

No, I was dying.

Were you dying?

Yeah, I need- I need to eat.

I need to eat.

I not need to eat.

You had tater tots.

I did.

I ate anyway, which I shouldn't have done.

What is the name of tater tots?

Why are they called tater tots?

I did a fun thing where I had two sides.

They're called tater tots- Sounds like every story.

They're the children of potatoes.

They're children.

They're potato children.

Yes.

They're potato children.

I like that.

I like the- I like the- I like the- I like the- Or in the common vernacular tater tots.

I like the- I like the idea that two potatoes, if you rub them together long enough, just tater tots will fall out.

Yeah.

Fall out- Fall out of the womb of one of the potatoes.

I love it.

And then you eat it.

Yeah, and then you eat it.

And then you eat it, and then you die.

Yeah.

First you eat it, then you die.

It's like the ring.

Ringo!

By the way, that's a character.

That was- That was- It was in Guardians of the Galaxy.

Ringo!

Ringo.

Yeah.

Blue Ringo.

Blue Ring- The blue Ringo.

I'm going back someday!

Come what made you do blue Ringo!

Where the fishing boats- Certainly, that is true.

By the way, this- Uh, another by the way.

By the other way, I am Scott ockerman.

By the way, do you know what song that's from?

I don't.

It's probably from a song called- Sound Familiar?

The sound familiar?

The song is not by the way.

Sound sounds familiar?

God's blood familiar?

All you sang were like, basically three notes.

Oh, by the way, I sang- I sang three notes, but also sang words.

That's true.

That's a good point.

Yeah, thank you.

No, I have no idea what song is that.

Is the song coming up close by till Tuesday?

Oh, okay, some of Amy Mann's earlier work.

That's true.

Which I am not incredibly- Incredibly- Filbier!

Get familiar with it!

Really?

Yeah, that album I love.

It's called- Is it called Weird Till Tuesday, and we're here to stay.

I was walking down the street just the other day.

I think it's called Welcome Home.

What does Amy- I can't remember the name of the album now.

I don't know, Engineer!

Cody Sam, please look up.

I'll look it up.

Amy Mann- Sam, don't worry, I'll take care of this.

I'll brought his own computer.

By the way, just to look things up.

Speaking of by the way, by the way, I am Scott Ocarman, and my co-host for these Best of Episodes, this is Best of 2017, part three.

I was right, Welcome Home.

Welcome Home!

So it's about the Olive Garden, like a concept album?

Yeah, the Olive Garden.

It's all about the Olive Garden.

My favorite track is Your Family.

Pustilaniano!

What was the festival that when I worked at the Olive Garden, I was a waiter at the Olive Garden.

Oh!

Hospitaliano!

That's what it was.

The Hospitaliano Festival.

I thought there was something else that I remember from the commercials.

There was like some sort of pasta- pasta-fangu.

No, that's not right.

That's definitely not right.

Pust up your ass!

Paul of Tomkins is across from me.

Welcome, Paul!

Scott, thank you for welcoming me.

What a pleasure it is to be here.

2018.

2018, let's talk about it.

So far?

Pop music, yes.

So far.

So far, one of the best years ever.

Do you think so?

I mean, what's happened?

This?

It's one of the 2018 best years ever.

Mm-hmm.

Yes, definitely.

I don't...

Because that's before Christ shit, GTFO before Christ.

Before Common Era is what I like to say.

Mm-hmm.

So, is that a different way of saying BC is before Common Era, really?

But I was always taught to that it stood for Christ.

Is that not?

It does.

But guess who says it?

Our old friends?

The Jews.

Dud Jews.

Hey, what do you think about Mike Dica and Dud Jews?

Jews.

Remember David Schwimmer and the people...

How can I forget David Schwimmer?

So, plaintively, crying, Jews.

Jews.

Oh, okay, that's what he's saying.

Jews.

And we were on a break, Jews.

We were on a break!

What are we doing?

It's a new year.

With our lives.

It's a new year.

Yes, true.

It is a new year, but we are still counting down.

Because of the vagaries of the Judeo calendar, is that the type of calendar we're in, right?

Yeah.

Roman calendar.

Is this the Julian calendar that we're in?

I don't know.

Where's the girl?

I can't...

Boy, this is common knowledge that we should have.

We should know.

These are things that a human being should know.

But we've been focusing on other things, like who are all the members of New Order?

Yeah.

And stuff like that.

Exactly.

Who are they?

Mmm, Bernard, Bernie Sumner, Peter Hook, Hooky, Jerome.

Jerome, and then of course, Josh.

No, we, because of the way the calendar fell this year, normally we're hitting the next year on our last episode, but we still have a couple left to go in the rest of 2017.

Their first one fell on Christmas.

Go back and listen to that.

And then part two was last Thursday today.

Monday falls upon New Year's Day, and we have one more coming up on the fourth.

This Thursday will complete our countdown.

May it be with you.

Yes, that's right.

Let them last.

I ever tell you, by the way.

Mark Hamill wrote to Bob Odenkirk when I was working on Mr.

Show.

Mr. Show was a semi-popular sketch show from the 90s that I was a writer on.

Critically acclaimed.

Critically acclaimed Bob Odenkirk, who's currently on Better Call Saul, was one of the stars.

Tossers in movies now.

He's in The Post with David.

David's a hell?

David and he are like buddies in The Post.

Oh, that's a mistake.

It's obnoxious.

Why are we buddies in a thing?

Seriously.

What the fuck?

It's next, no, sir.

Did you see there like in Nick Croll's animated show, they like drew two characters based on us.

Are we the voices?

Is that true?

I think so.

Oh, that makes me very angry.

Hell naw.

Oh, hell naw!

Oh!

How many hours do we have to work together?

It's a for instance.

We've like put us in something.

We've eclipsed everything that Bob and David have done.

Seriously.

I remember Bob and David did 30 episodes of Mr. Show.

And on my bullshit.

On my third season, I hit 31.

Oh, yeah.

To 50.

I got a good good dude.

Bye-bye, Bob and David.

Bye-bye.

Go, go, go, go, go.

Go, go, go, go.

Bye-bye, David.

Clib, that should be a character.

Bye-bye, David.

Bob and David.

Why not?

They're both in the post.

Steven Spielberg film.

If you've seen a Steven Spielberg film, you've seen this one.

But where were we talking about?

Oh, yes.

On the show, Mark Hamill, I guess, wrote to Bob and David wanting maybe his son, if he has a son or a child was interested in the show or maybe he got into the show, I can't recall.

But he wrote requesting videotapes of the current season that we had just completed.

And I was pleading with Bob.

I said, please include a note that says, May the fourth season be with you.

And Bob was like, I'm not going to do that.

Come on, just kind of piss him off.

Piss him off.

I'm like, what do you care if we piss off Mark Hamill?

He's a great guy, I'm sure.

But what do we care?

We never met him.

Bob had never met him.

It's not like he was his personal friend or anything like that.

And I know what we know now about Mark Hamill, where he's like this goofball, who likes cool shit.

I bet he would have loved it.

He would have loved it.

Fucking Mark Hamill would have loved it.

He would have loved that shit.

He wouldn't have eaten that shit off.

If you open that fucking box and you saw that, that box, open your box, Mark.

What's in the box?

What if the notes had made the fourth season be with you and it was just went with Baltrow's head?

By the way, spoiler alert for seven.

But I don't think people are going to be returning to seven.

You named the movie.

It would have been fine if you hadn't named the movie.

They suddenly get to what's in the box.

I think I remember this from the confirmation thing.

No one's going to be going back to seven anymore.

Seven is a weird sort of culture movie.

Well, you got Spacy in it now.

Oh, the space.

The space.

Oh, you got it.

You can't watch a movie with the space anymore.

Can't watch a movie with the space.

Can you seriously, if it's a classic movie and you didn't know what was going on with space, can you rewatch something with space in all the usual suspects?

Let's say you got a hanger and watch K-Packs again.

Sure.

You're like, I got to see it or pay it forward.

The shipping news.

Joes.

I don't know.

I don't know either Scott.

I don't know. I love baby driver.

I love baby driver.

You know, can we watch that anymore?

Do you want to come over to tonight and watch it?

I got the spaces in that.

The spaces.

He's great.

Spaces.

We've established.

I don't have any plans.

That's right.

We were talking during the break.

I was like, do I need to hustle Paul out of here?

And I was like, I think he had plans tonight.

And then I remembered that we had had this scheduled last week or the week before and I felt terribly ill.

And you had plans that night.

I believe you're going to see the DJ Aishir artist.

Correcta Mundo.

Thank you, Fange.

And you have no plans tonight.

So we're going late tonight.

What if we did past the countdown?

We just did two more ups.

Two more ups.

I would love it.

Got a bank sum.

How fucking insane will we be?

You got a bank sum?

You know what?

I realized last year when we did these best ups.

By the way, if you've never heard the show before, Paul and I have for years now, maybe six, seven years now have done these countdowns together with Paul, who if you've never heard the format of the show, I am the host of it and I speak to celebrities.

The guest of it.

But Paul, you're quite often and most of the time playing characters.

It's very true.

You're fake people.

And a lot of what you'll hear on these clips are comedians playing fake people.

But last year when we did the best ups, we did it right directly after the giant two and a half hour Christmas episode.

That's right.

I forgot about that.

What a day.

What a day indeed.

What a day.

What a day it won.

Sometimes, and this is not telling tales out of school, but sometimes I'll take three episodes in a row.

That's nuts.

And what's weird is the third one is not good?

No, you would think the third one would be terrible, but it usually varies.

It's usually like, oh man, that middle one was terrible, but the first one, you know, who knows?

Sometimes the punchiness, it's fun.

Sometimes it's fun.

It's a lot of fun.

You're shooting down the walls of Harding.

Bang, bang.

I am the warrior.

Shooting down the walls of Harding.

Comedy, bang, bang.

She should do a remake.

That's fun.

She should do a remake for you.

Just for me personally.

Yeah.

She's just singing it in my face with her onion breath.

How much?

Why do you assume she has onion breath?

Yeah.

Can I tell you though, there are some, sometimes I see actors on television, and I think, I can't get it out of my head.

I bet he has bad breath.

Yeah.

Sometimes I think about that with just human beings in general.

I think it's when people have certain voices.

Yeah, like a Denny E type.

No, you know what?

I never thought about his breath.

But I will say watching Battlestar Galactica.

The bald, oh no.

And we're James O'Brien.

It's like, I bet he has bad breath.

And Edward James, by the way, we're big fans.

We love your work.

Absolutely.

But, uh...

Stand and deliver.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, money.

All y'all live.

How great would it have been if that film had that song?

That had a man.

It's a theme song.

Noted to be great.

And the whole cast sang it at the end.

Two cameras.

After the credits.

Most like the Last American version?

No, what am I thinking?

A 40 year old version.

Yes.

Were they saying age of Aquarius?

That's right.

Mm-hmm.

Paul, what's your favorite comedy movie of all time?

Of all time?

Of all times you can pick any time period.

Shh.

1981, for instance, would be a time.

Time.

I feel like you're leading me into something.

No, I do know what you picked when I hosted a series at...

I can't even mention the Santa family anymore.

You would.

But I hosted a series where comedians would show their favorite films and we would discuss them afterwards.

And do you remember what you picked?

I believe I picked Peewee's Big Adventure.

Peewee's Big Adventure.

Which is one of the more delightful experiences you'll have in a movie theater.

Absolutely.

If you see Peewee's Big Adventure.

It was fun to watch it with a crowd.

Mm-hmm.

Of people laughing and enjoying the film.

A lot of people I bet have only seen that film in their living room.

Or living room.

And...

Or living spaces.

If they went to a living space.

Or they saw training spaces.

And then in training spaces somehow Peewee's Big Adventure was just playing.

And Paige was like, hey, are you excited for training spaces to come back by the way?

The TV show?

No.

I've never watched it.

Never watched it.

Do you remember part of it?

That's Chip and Joanna.

Probably, yes.

No, she's not Chip and Joanna.

Which one is them?

That's which one is them.

Which one is them?

Now which one is them?

Which one is them?

Now I do win your party.

No, which one is them?

Who are we sort of doing Senator Tanger Bell?

A little bit.

Yeah.

How did Bob ever think of Senator Tanger Bell?

It's so indelible.

I mean, he's probably high.

Yeah.

Right?

Oh, those guys must have been so high.

They must have been so high.

Nope.

In fact, it was very difficult.

What were we talking about?

Oh, yeah.

Trading spaces, trading.

Oh, Pee-Wees is a big adventure.

Yes.

Most people have only seen it in their homes.

And with comedies, a lot of times you can watch a drama in your home.

I think still be affected by it.

But comedies are great to watch with crowds.

That's what we're trying to do.

It's fun.

With that film series.

And it's so much fun to see a film like that with a crowd.

Yes.

Another one that I enjoy very much is The Wrong Guy with Dave Foley.

Show that as well with Dave Foley and Dave Higgins.

Very funny movie.

Yes.

And just came out on Blu-ray.

Blu-ray.

I got it myself.

Please let's give a plug for that because that's really fun.

Really funny movie.

One of the funnier movies of the 1990s.

Comedy's are tough because they don't hold up so well.

So it's hard for me to remember.

It's hard for me to think of comedies that I liked, say when I was a kid, that I would still say today.

Oh, this is really funny.

I will say in that series, we, I asked a variety of comedians to do it.

I did some of the UCB theater as well.

And it would run the gamut between people bringing films that they were very familiar with and still held up.

Such as Tom Lennon brought Man With Two Brains, which is great until the video game part of the end.

And then Bob, the aforementioned Bob Odenkirk, Star of the Post brought bananas by.

I love you, Woody Allen.

I mean, I love you, you know.

And it ate shit.

Wow.

No one laughed at all.

Wow.

And I remember Bob came up afterwards and we were supposed to talk about the film and he was like, wow, I mean, obviously I liked that better when I was a kid.

I guess it doesn't hold up.

I don't know.

And I guess he probably hadn't seen it since.

I don't think that he had seen it since then.

I hadn't seen it since maybe I was 16 or something like that.

And we were like, and this is, you know, before, I mean, it wasn't, you can't even make that excuse.

It wasn't before everything went down, but it was before, you know, everyone had turned against Woody Allen.

Everyone's like, oh, cool, Woody Allen Classic.

And just did not work.

Yeah.

It did not work at all.

I remember, I used to love take the money and run.

I can't imagine.

I wonder if it would hold up at all.

I think when you're young, as the killer said, you're just so happy that people are being silly.

It's like people being silly in a movie because movies and entertainment in general are just like tedious affairs.

You know, with people being very serious.

The Supreme Court decision just came in.

The Supreme Court decision was supreme court.

Just.

Just carry reporting for duty.

Just to so leto.

Just an actor.

And you're just an actor.

But movies are so dreadfully serious.

So frightfully serious.

That when you're a young person like ourselves, where we're just like, come on, and can't everyone lighten up and be funny?

You know, you're just delighted by people acting silly.

Yeah, because it's a, you're listening to grownups talking.

It's boring.

They talk about the weather.

Yeah.

You want to see somebody clown around up there.

Now the one adult that talks about the weather that's funny is Dallas Raines.

Of course.

Here in Los Angeles.

I've all guessed.

I don't love them.

I love them.

We're both doing the.

Then you can't see.

The fist bump.

He, what he does is Dallas Raines.

Dallas Raines is a local KABC.

Yeah.

And he's telling you, I'm going to talk about the weather later.

These are like three or five second promos with the news that.

Yeah.

Here's some, here's some, I'm teasing weather topics.

I'm going to be discussing.

By the way, in Los Angeles, how is that a tease for, oh man, I got to catch that weather.

Yeah.

You know, it's like, shouldn't shouldn't they be teases about like, you know, disaster just happens in whatever.

Disaster teases.

So then at the end, when he says at 11, my seven day forecast, he reaches out with an.

He grabs some air.

He grabs none.

Makes a fist and turns it around and shakes it at the camera.

And shakes it like, like, I got you.

Shriem.

You're not going to escape the fist of Dallas Raines.

In this.

Six temper.

Tyrannus.

He's great.

Catch.

I'm, there must be a, there must be a super cut out there of Dallas.

Oh, I hope, I hope so.

He's great.

And by the way, Dallas Raines, if you're listening, we'd love to have you on the show.

And Paul, you're going to look up super cut Dallas Raines.

Look up super cut Dallas Raines.

Super cut Dallas Raines.

What if it just pictures of him looking super cut?

Just like a 12 pack.

Damn, Dallas Raines.

He's a good looking man.

He's for what he is, which is a man.

He's good looking.

You're right.

That was rain.

Damn, Dallas Raines Daniel.

Damn.

What do you, yeah.

Damn Daniel.

You got it again with the white fans.

That's weird.

Why were you doing that?

Was that on an episode?

I don't remember.

I think so.

It was John, John Hurt doing that.

Damn, damn, damn.

Damn, damn.

Get back into the game with the white fans.

It makes me laugh.

I don't even know if I've ever seen the original damn Daniel video, but that makes me laugh.

I know what it is.

Because I'm plugged into popular culture.

What do you got?

You got a super cut?

Doesn't look like it.

Really not even a single like.

I don't look like it.

No.

Yeah.

What weather forecast?

My seven day series at 11.

It's weird that there's so many clips of him.

Really?

Of this weatherman.

Yeah.

It's strange.

There's a lot of clips, but not the clips of the promos.

Is that what you're saying?

Or you're just looking at what are they clips of?

Describe some of these clips.

It is honestly like, here's one latest weather with Dallas Rames.

That was posted a year ago.

Why would someone post the weather?

Well, it's like the website, I guess the ABC7 website, post them, but then they just leave them up.

Yeah, delete these.

Come on.

It's eating up your bandwidth.

Bandwidth is a precious come on.

This was Dallas Rames 30th anniversary.

Forecasting, I can weather.

So the California is 30th anniversary forecast.

30th anniversary forecast.

What do you do?

Do you do special weather?

I think he did special anniversary weather.

Yeah.

It's just hail.

It rains happy anniversary to me.

Dallas Rames praising God for the weather.

Okay.

That I want to hear.

Can you play some of that?

FSU, some university.

FSU.

Son of a bitch.

Oh, somebody posted something called funny weatherman.

Oh, and did they just saw him and was like, that's a funny one.

Oh, he does a lot of different hand gestures.

A lot of fist pumps.

It's almost like the...

You can plug that in, by the way, if you want the aux cord.

I might.

It's...

Well, you know what?

This is kind of the super cut of him doing it.

Okay.

Where did it go?

Where...

Where did it go?

All right.

We're going to plug it in.

Plug it in.

What did it do?

All right.

What do we got?

Here's Dallas Rames.

Is that turned up, my man?

All right.

Here we go.

Dallas Rames.

Dallas Rames under the caption, funny weatherman.

Which is accurate.

So posted by BB Flyman.

BB Flyman.

Is it plugged in, Paul?

Okay.

It is plugged in.

So shut the fuck up.

Okay.

So here's what he does.

It is a three part gesture.

Three part gesture.

One part.

He points.

Then he puts his all his fingers out.

Okay.

Then he does the fist.

Points.

Points with one finger flat hand.

And then the fist.

Do you remember Caesar Romero in Ocean's 11?

Didn't we see that together?

Yes.

He says, I'm going to marry your mama.

I'm going to marry his mama.

And then he does the flat hand and snaps with it.

He snaps somehow.

Yeah.

It's a weird.

Snaps and does the flat hand.

Everyone knows who he means by the flat hand.

That's palm down.

Palm down.

Ass up.

That's the way we like to fuck.

The flat hand obviously.

Caesar Romero does it.

Do you remember when CJ Craig did the flat hand in the office?

No.

The next way.

Everyone gathered around.

Oh yes.

CJ's doing the flat hand.

The flat hand.

Oh, the flat hand.

Oh, my greatest ambition is to do something as good as the Jackal.

Why don't you just do the Jackal?

How did you just do the Jackal?

Did you hear Scott?

I'm going to do the Jackal.

You should do it and put it on YouTube.

Just you in an office.

Just me doing the- Lip sinking to the Jackal.

I didn't.

Barely any movement.

I've never even heard that song the Jackal.

I never had either.

If you don't know what we're talking about, we're talking about the Jackal.

Anyway.

I hope that cleared up.

Hope that clears it up.

Oh fuck yourself.

So we got a point.

We got a flat hand.

Point.

Flat hand.

Then the Victoria's fist.

It's not even a fist pump like Tiger Woods.

It's just a- No, it's not a pump.

It's a victory.

We're doing it.

It's almost like you squashed a bug and you're taunting it.

It's like you squashed a bug.

Squashed a bug turning it.

Ah, bug.

He's going to go go.

Bug, swash.

Dallas Raines, look him up.

He's one of America's greatest treasures.

Dallas Raines, look him up.

Thank me later.

Love to have you on the show, Dallas.

If you're listening.

Love to have you, Dallas.

Fritz Coleman.

Ah.

No, sir.

You're- You are horgially disinvited.

I hate to diss, Fritz Coleman, but I once was watching my public access on cable.

Just the other day?

Back in the- Just the other day.

I was walking down the street strangely enough.

And I, it was public access and they were showing, this is in the 90s, they were showing his one man show.

It's me, Dad.

Is that what it's called?

It's me, Dad.

Have I ever told you about?

You've seen it, Dad.

I've seen it, yes.

You've seen it.

Okay.

I used to have a VHS copy of it.

Ooh, mama.

So the very end, all I saw was the very end.

I tuned in and saw the heart-breaking moment of it where it's getting- I'm sure it wasn't funny because he's a stand-up comedian, right?

Yes.

Was it supposed to be a funny, you know, like- It was a serial comic, yes.

Right.

But the very end is where, you know, in everyone man show, a little rain must fall.

It's very true.

As the tears do.

And he was talking to his unborn son, I believe, or his son.

Stillborn son?

Hey, wake up!

Wake up!

That's like slapping him.

I'm Prince.

I said it with me like this.

No, he's talking to a kid who either is about to be born or he's leaving this whole show right as a testament to his child.

He wants something like that.

Something like that.

Don't remember.

And I remember this is the very end of the show and he's saying like, When I look at you, you literally rip my heart out of my chest.

I was like- Stop looking at him then.

Prince!

This has gone through rehearsals, dress rehearsals, enough performances where it's been a success enough that someone says, Hey, let's film this.

Yeah.

And no one has ever said to you.

You don't mean literally, by the way.

Your baby is not literally ripping your heart.

You're iritably ripped the heart out of my chest.

Which does not sound good.

No, it doesn't sound good.

But, uh, Fritz.

For that reason?

For that reason you are just invited.

Dallas, hit us up.

What's weird is that show opens with- He's got a mouth full of blood.

He does, really?

He gives a like a mouth full of beans or- Just pouring out of the- Just like mouth.

He's like- And then he says, Oh hello, I didn't see you there.

Oh, what's this?

Oh, I seem to be bleeding from the mouth.

Does he like put on other hats?

And I feel bad- No, no hats.

I feel bad talking about a living person who someone- And look, don't be a Twitter snitch.

Don't write to Fritz.

Yeah, don't be a Twitter snitch.

And say that we talked about him and then he listens and I feel bad.

Like Fritz, you've been a part of my life for decades.

That's right.

Not that I watch the news every single day.

But you're- But you know what I mean?

Like you're a cultural icon at this point here in Los Angeles.

It wouldn't be the same without you.

It wouldn't be.

And you don't need to jerks like us who are just, you know, want to be comedians.

You know, sitting around talking shit about you.

You're a success.

You're- I wonder how much money he'd be.

Let's look him up on comedian.

All that said though.

How many- Can you do it Sam?

Look up, look up.

What?

I'm sorry, I feel bad talking about Fritz.

Honestly, let's look up how much, buddy.

I have had the experience several times over the past couple of weeks.

And I realized it where I felt worried about celebrities.

And I felt like, oh no, I hope they're doing okay.

I hope they have enough money.

And I've looked them up on celebrity networks to be like, oh God, I hope they're okay.

And the aforementioned Danny Ielo is one of them.

Danny Ielo.

I saw Danny Ielo- Is that what I wanna know?

No, you were not.

But I saw Danny Ielo in an older film that I was watching.

And I went, oh no, is Danny Ielo still with us?

Are I possible?

Was it- That's in Hawk?

Uh, I wish.

What?

Fritz Coleman, look up Fritz Coleman.

No results.

No results, Fritz, are you okay?

Has he been erased?

Oh no.

Fritz Coleman, no results.

He's from the internet.

We're the only people that remember Fritz Coleman.

Oh no, maybe we're crazy.

No, but Danny Ielo, I was like, oh God, is he dead?

I looked him up, not dead.

And then I thought he hasn't done anything for- And he used to be in everything.

Yeah.

Every movie that you saw in the late 80s through the 90s, if it was a quality film of Danny Ielo was in it.

Once around, he's great in that.

He played Tally 100 Dad, which two very dissimilar actors.

You can't see the lineage.

Was he in Proborosiciro?

Was he- I believe he did a Woody.

He did a Woody.

A Woody.

Um, but then I realized if he's still around, why hasn't he done anything?

He did do a movie last year, 2017.

But I started getting very worried, like, oh shit, is he okay?

And I looked him up on celebrity net worth.

I'm like, God, I hope Danny Ielo isn't scrounged around for money.

He's an older gentleman.

Maybe he's infirm and he can't work anymore.

How much engineer Sam, how much does Danny Ielo have in the bank?

But you're the only person who pronounces his name that way, by the way.

What is it?

Ielo.

Where is Ielo?

Ielo.

This is like Nick Wider with Cameron Diaz.

Diaz.

Well, you know, I, for a long time, I was saying, uh, gal Gadot and everyone would laugh at me.

And now people have finally come around that that's how you say it.

Is it Gadot?

It's Gadot, yeah.

And I would, anytime I would say people go, huh, thinking I was making a joke, and I'm like, no, that's how it's pronounced.

What do we got with Danny Ielo?

Celebrity- Three million.

Three million.

He's got three million.

He's fine.

Not bad.

He's fine.

He's good.

Although I will say, I think my net worth is estimated at over a million or two million or something like that.

That is not true.

That is.

But maybe it's just, you know, what you got floating out there.

You know what I mean?

It's an estimate based on all the time that I have been alive and working.

I actually think it's based on debt.

Factoring and like, he probably had a paper root.

Did you ever have a paper root?

Never did.

I did.

The register, Orange County Register.

Not fun.

You know that whole scam of where they make you pay for the papers that, you know, like you're supposed to, as a kid, keep great track of how many actual papers you need delivered and you're supposed to cancel the paper for people who cancel.

What?

Do you not?

You're not.

No.

Okay. So this is a big part of paper roots or routes is that the register makes the person who delivers the papers order the amount of papers and then that's, oh, and then you sell it to the people and you're responsible for paying for these papers no matter what.

So if someone stiffs you, your problem, you should have collected.

If you did not cancel their paper or if there was a mistake of, you know, like, oh man, I ordered, you know, nine papers too many, that's your problem.

You have to pay for it and they charge you.

Oh, I'm getting some late breaking information from engineer Cody Sam.

Uh oh.

Heightweightnetworth.com says for Fritz Coleman, how much do you think?

And what website is this?

Heightweightnetworth.com?

Let's say he's, I would say he's.

What do you think of Fritz Coleman should, like what's, what's fair?

I think he's from a six one.

What's fair.

What's his way?

I would say he weighs 190.

He's a thin gentleman.

What do you think he has and what do you think is just and what do you think he's worth?

Like if you were to hear what amount would you go like, yeah, I can see that.

He's been working for a while.

That's what he's, that's what he deserves.

$12 million is what he deserves or what he has.

What he has and what do you think he deserves?

$1 million.

What is the prize you sir to say that heightwetnetworth.com?

Well, how wet is he?

Did I say soaking?

Splash Mountain level of wetness.

$20 million for Fritz Coleman.

Oh, that's too much. That's too much.

Fritz, now I don't feel bad.

Get the fuck out of your friends.

What? You are re-disinvited.

Re-disinvited.

Does not list height or weight, apparently.

Too bad.

I bet I'm right though.

I bet you are right.

Does not list amount of wetness either.

Okay, we need to get to our countdown, Paul.

I forgot about that.

Yeah, we're doing a countdown here.

I forgot about the countdown.

And that leads us to today we're going to be counting down episodes.

And by the way, you all voted for this.

The eligibility period is Thanksgiving of 2016 through Thanksgiving of 2017.

It's not a calendar year.

That's the year it gives us time to tally up the votes and prepare the clips.

And so this is what you all voted on.

I mentioned it before.

Over 40,000 votes for these episodes and some tight, tight races.

And GTRs.

On our previous episodes, some tight races.

I will say one through eight were pretty consistent from the very beginning of the countdown.

They did not move.

They were by and by large, they were the most popular episodes.

So this final eight, there's no doubt about it.

No doubt about it.

People loved these episodes.

There is a disparity of votes between eight and nine.

Where I would say nine through 20, nine through 23, we're all very close.

Sometimes even one vote between them determined their ranking out of 40,000.

Isn't that crazy?

Sometimes one vote.

Crazy.

But one through eight were solidly since the beginning of the voting through the end of voting, the most popular episodes.

And do they remain in those positions?

They remain in their order.

Yeah.

Exactly.

So there is no dispute about these eight.

This is their undeniable ranking.

If I'm not in any of these, I'm going to be very angry.

You might not be in any of these, but let's find out.

Well, I'm already in the end.

This, let's get to it.

This is your episode eight.

All right, episode eight.

We were just talking about, what were we just talking about?

I know we have a lot of topics.

But we were talking about something that CJ Craig.

The Jackal.

The Jackal, of course.

Now, what does that make you think of?

Well, it makes me think of a time when we were in this very room.

This very room.

With some very special people.

That's right.

And those people, it will not surprise you to learn after giving you that hint, are the stars of this episode.

This is episode 478 from March 27th, an episode called Spank Me With a Feather.

That's right.

Spank Me With a Feather.

Now, let's do a roll call of who we have.

Obviously, we have Paul F. Tomkins was here.

Hair present.

We have Lauren Lapkis.

This is her second appearance on the countdown.

Absolutely.

And the two of you were playing Chasmin and Sunny.

Yes.

We have two people who I mentioned on an earlier episode.

There are people who are on TV shows who sometimes stumble across the show, and they become fans, and they want to be on it.

And these two are no exception to that rule.

We have From Orphan Black, we have Tatiana Maslani, and Christian Broun.

That's right.

The Dream Team Combo.

Yes, Indeed.

Two great people who became friends on Orphan Black.

Tatiana played the titular Orphan Black.

I don't even know if that's true.

Yeah, sure.

Maybe it was.

Was she called Orphan Black on it?

I don't know.

Yes.

No.

She played a variety of characters.

The phrase Orphan Black to my knowledge.

Was it ever spoken?

You know what?

I still haven't seen the final season.

I haven't seen the final season either.

I haven't downloaded and I haven't watched it yet.

As do I, my good dear boy.

Yay!

But Christian played one of the clones' husband, and they became fast friends.

Yes.

They love hanging out together.

And they're a very good comedy team on the show.

They're very funny.

They played the characters that they played.

He played the husband of the funniest clone.

Oh, the husband.

You know, the husband.

We've talked about that on previous episodes.

And they've done the show several times, and they, I don't know, even know how long they've been listening to it, but they listen to a lot.

And that's always fun when an Emmy winner and a guy who was sitting next to her or near her.

And by the way, he's on a different show.

Like she only had the one show.

Yeah.

He had two shows he was juggling.

He was Constable, Constable, Constable, Constable, on the, the, the, the art of murder.

The art of, of, of hey, manslaughter.

It's a bad deal.

And he just, and spoilers for any fans of that show, whatever it was, he, he went out, he died in a hail of bullets on that show.

Yeah.

So he's, he's no longer on that.

Yeah.

All of them to the face.

All of them, right.

He's just like pizza face.

See, it was, I think something like 70 bullets to the face.

So he's no longer on that show, but he's on some other show or something.

And then she, uh, he was on, um, Handmaid's Tale.

Was he on Handmaid's Tale?

Yes, he was.

He was in a real Handmaid's Tale.

What do you play on?

He plays a creepy doctor.

Ah, that's really, that's his wheelhouse.

Creeps.

We like to tease him.

We like to tease Christian.

We hang out socially.

We know he's listening.

That's the thing.

He's a loser.

That's the thing.

We know he's listening.

We know this loser listens to the show.

Tatiana, she probably dips in and out.

Yeah.

But Christian, better things to do.

Christian is like waiting for midnight for these things to drive.

Stupid loser.

And Christian, of course, like he joined us on tour in Toronto.

Yes.

And, uh, so much fun.

Uh, great guy.

We heard the keg, keg mentioned.

And I mentioned the jackal because this, I don't know whether it was this episode, but we all watched the jackal on it.

It was this episode.

It was this episode because also Mary Holland.

Mary Holland is here as Janice Cramps.

That's right.

As well.

Very special episode for me.

But I, but I think there was one, the previous year with Janice Cramps, as well.

Was there not?

Is it the previous year?

I think it was the previous year.

I think this is the second one that she plays Janice Cramps in.

What was her thing the second time?

Uh, she did not, yes, she did not have the baby or we'll hear it.

Uh, but this is this, this is her second appearance, uh, as Janice Cramps.

This is blowing my mind.

Yes.

It's, I mean, like we said, this year went by very quickly.

But this is the time that we watched the jackal.

I believe this is the time we watched the jackal.

Yeah.

It came up off Mike.

Right.

And some people had not seen it.

So we watched it.

I posted a picture on Instagram.

Of everyone, Malthus, the game.

Yes.

Yeah.

Um, so we're not going to hear that part of it.

Go back and listen to it.

But we are going to hear, this is Paul and Lauren as Chasmin and Sunny, uh, who are a, have been on several episodes before.

They are a couple of, uh, radio personalities.

Morning DJs.

Well, in Washington, uh, based in Washington, DC, who do, uh, a show personally for the presidency.

That's every morning.

And parts of Asia.

I forgot about that.

So this is, spanked me with a feather.

Great episode.

This is your episode eight.

Number eight.

They've been on the show a few times before.

That's right.

They are, uh, they are, of course, a morning duo.

Of course we are.

That's all right.

In, uh, the market of Washington, DC.

And around the world.

No, but mainly DC.

Uh, that's right.

Washington, DC.

And I think almost all of Asia.

That's right.

Almost all of Asia.

Which is a lot of the world.

Please welcome back to the show Chasmin and Sunny.

Hi, daddy.

Hello everyone.

Scott, thanks for having us back on your program.

We love it here.

We do.

Do you really?

Thank you so much.

Yes.

It's a safe place for us.

We're scared.

It feels good in our blankies.

We're in a big snuggy right now.

That's right.

Well, uh, I was, uh, you could have knocked me over with a feather when you guys hopped in.

We tried to.

Yeah, you brought several feathers over there.

And a really big one from an ostrich.

It pecked me on the head.

Boy, dupe today.

Dupe, it said.

Dint.

Out.

Do you guys remember?

No.

Do you?

I went cross-eyed.

How are you?

Wait a minute.

There are cartoon birds floating above your head.

How are you achieving this?

Achieving.

Make it stop.

Wait, this is not your doing.

This is not Sonny's doing.

She has a rare disorder.

Oh, it is some sort of cartoon disorder where...

Yeah.

Well, I'm no doctor, but what happens is sometimes cartoon birds appear above her head that other people can see.

Wow.

And he sometimes plays doctor on the radio.

It's true.

Wait a minute.

Now you're...

I asked to look into people's pants.

I'm not wearing any.

You're looking over here.

That's right.

So you're safe from me.

You're looking over here at Sonny and you're imagining a big turkey.

Sonny.

Me?

No, I mean Sonny, you're looking at Christian.

Yes, I'm hungry.

How do you know what Sonny is imagining?

Because it's visible to much like her cartoon birds.

It's visible to other people.

What you don't see is that you have lipstick and a dress up.

Do you guys remember...

It's probably a boom.

Do you guys remember Christian and Tatiana over here?

Oh, of course.

We remember all the people we've blessed with our presents.

All right.

Let's run them down.

Who do you got?

You.

Them.

Every president of the United States since John F. Kennedy.

Including Trump.

That's right.

Now we have a new president.

So you guys have, of course, performed for him.

He requests very specific programming.

Exactly.

He's the only one who's ever installed a call-in number for our station.

As you know, there's a radio in the White House that's broken.

And so it only gets our program.

Right.

So the president must listen to us.

Right.

That's all right.

No choice.

Right.

This has all been talked about on previous episodes.

Yes, but...

I know.

We like to explain.

But...

It's fun.

This president's got a very specific request.

Yes.

He called us up and said, Please, will you tell me bedtime stories in the middle of the day?

Oh, so he likes to take a nap in the middle of the day?

No, he remains wide awake.

But he likes to hear bedtime stories.

Yes.

He puts a blanket over him when you do that.

We don't see him.

We can't see anyone.

We're both legally blind.

Oh, wait.

This is a new one.

What?

Is it?

We've never discussed this before.

What?

I do wear thick glasses, but I'm legally blind.

I wear actual Coke bottles with...

Arms on them.

They're protruding out.

Wait, with arms.

They're pee-wee-hermond-doll arms.

That's right.

They used to say something, but the screen broke.

So he made a new thing.

That's right.

Passes.

How did you guys get...

Was it just a deterioration of your eyes or...

It was a monumentous deterioration of our eyes.

It was just monumentous.

We...

I remember...

We were sitting under the blanket.

And we were trying to read a coloring book.

Yes.

First of all, not colorful enough.

It was very dull.

The first complaint, only black and white.

Just seemed like line drawings.

I didn't understand the point.

Why are they called coloring books?

And then I remember trying to read what was written underneath the picture, which I could barely make out.

Right.

And I turned to Sunny and I said, Sunny, can you make heads or tails of this?

And so he said...

I can't make heads or tails of my own body.

And then I farted from my mouth.

That was a separate issue.

Things are mixed up in there.

As you can see, my heart's on the outside.

Right.

Yeah, I can see that.

If it stops, do you want me to reach over and just pump it a few times?

Sure.

He loves that.

He's very perverted.

Sunny, can I ask, how do you...

How do you defecate?

Um...

Well, here I go.

There she goes.

Like a champ.

On command, though.

I did.

I let it be said, I did not command you.

He texted me.

Can we do something about the little poop that just fell out onto the table?

You want it?

No, no.

Maybe like, Sunny will sign that for you.

Oh.

I'll sign it with perfume.

What does that mean?

She's got a perfume bin.

I have a...

I actually started a company.

It's a perfume company.

We started together.

He's modest.

That's right.

But we used...

I'm the CEO and COO.

We used America's favorite scent.

Which is...

Shit.

So, okay.

This is what you're gonna sign the little shit with shit now.

That's right.

Just signature shit.

It smells a lot like real shit.

Why do you think that's America's favorite scent?

Everyone...

Have you ever been to America's got?

I believe I'm very cultured.

Take a look around with your nose.

You'll find that the smell of shit is everywhere in the United States.

It's President Trump's favorite scent.

Oh, really?

Yeah.

That's interesting.

He loves it dukie in his mouth.

Duf.

Every bedtime story we tell him has to end with...

And then the guy ate shit.

And then he says, no, I'm happy.

Interesting.

Interesting things you hear about historical facts about our presidents.

So interesting.

Interesting the things you hear about historical facts about our presidents.

You can't predict them at all.

So guys, it's so good to see you.

I mean, I believe we first met when Tatiana and Christian, you were here.

Is that right?

Can that be possible?

Yeah.

That is possible.

Well, I'll take your word for it.

It's true.

We'll submit scar tail.

Sonny, I'll take your word for it to scar tail your bad.

Oh, he's not here.

Scar tail our producer is here right now.

Not right now.

Who knows what he could show?

Anything can happen.

What have you guys been up to?

I mean, obviously Trump's in the White House now, so you have added duties, but him added duties.

No kidding.

You said it.

But what's going on with the show?

Are there changes for 2017?

Well, we were a little worried about the ratings, so we decided to just mix things up a little bit.

And so we brought someone else on board to just kind of be our foil.

Oh, you know, how it works on radio shows.

You have the two people who are the main people.

And then you have a third person.

Like a movie.

You could act like a dumb person.

Yeah, you could actually do without them.

They just serve to make the other two people.

The main two people look good.

Right.

Yeah, you could just make fun of them.

So who is this person?

Well, his name is Grover.

Scar tail?

Grover Scar tail.

Oh, I know.

I just, I thought I heard Scar tail, but that's what a coincidence.

No, it was his name is Grover Scar tail, but it's just his last name.

Wait a minute.

Is this Scar tail?

No, no, no.

No, no.

Scar tail.

No, no.

Scar tail.

No, no.

Scar, no.

Scar tail.

No, no.

Scar tail.

No, Scar tail.

Very different.

No, I'm sorry.

You got to listen.

Scar tail.

I'm sitting.

Hey.

I'm sitting.

Put a bone in his mouth.

His panting.

And thank you later.

Okay, I'll sit down.

Dump.

I'll sit down.

Dump.

Here's the thing.

Scar tail's first name is Scar tail.

Grover Scar tail's last name is Grover Scar tail.

Oh, what's his first name?

Scar tail.

Grover Scar tail.

It's a little confusing.

Okay.

So we have a producer's name is Scar tail.

And then our foil's name is Scar tail.

Grover Scar tail.

What is Scar tail's last name?

Who?

That your producer is Scar tail.

Scar.

Scar's tail, Scar's and Scar's tail, Grover Scar's tail.

Yes.

That's okay.

And so they're not related.

Different last names?

Oh, very interesting.

And does Scar's tail have actual scars?

Or do you either of them, I guess?

Well, we do.

You want to see our work?

Oh, you did.

Do you work?

We had a knife fight last week in our vault.

Oh, gosh.

Over.

We sleep at a vault.

It got very contentious when we found an Olympic gold medal.

And both of us wanted to keep it.

That's right.

What was it for?

What event?

It was Bruce Jenner's triathlon medal.

I don't know who Bruce Jenner is.

He was a man who ran in the Olympics.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, someone in history who doesn't exist in here.

Okay, right.

I mean, to be one.

Wait, wait a second.

Hold on.

Everyone.

Hold on, PC crowd.

Should I have said it was Caitlyn Jenner's medal?

Yes.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

It's a whole new world and we're old- Yes.

There's just people at this.

Bruce won it.

We're trying to navigate the world.

What is it?

I'm just trying to be right.

I didn't realize that we erased.

I'm sorry, Caitlyn.

Caitlyn won it back then.

We just want to make sure that we're racing.

No, you can't get anything right these days.

I'm- I look- What? You're not supposed to say it's President Eats Pooh?

Is that bad?

Am I punished?

Do you want me?

I love me up and spank me with a feather.

Very ineffective.

I don't like being spanked.

There you go.

Well, I apologize.

So you guys were fighting over this medal for a triathlon- Yeah, we both wanted it.

This was worth a lot of money.

Okay, sure.

It's our retirement plan.

And then we stabbed each other.

Several times.

Where?

Mostly the abdomen.

Yep.

Few times in the face.

Got me in the neck.

Oh, yeah, look at that.

God.

It's a perfect circle.

He used a pencil.

It was a knife fight, but at times we did switch it up with pencils.

That really was getting too dangerous.

Well, you know, we're in a bank.

So they had very pointy- pointy, always sharp in pencils.

You all have banks that have tons of pencils.

That is what's- That is what's- That is a typical bank.

Yeah.

Filve with sharp in pencils.

Number eight.

Okay, episode eight.

Okay.

So fun.

Paul, you made it back on the countdown.

Well, I'm glad.

This is your fourth episode.

In the top 16.

Congratulations.

Is it my final?

It may be.

I don't want to give it- By the way, if this is your first episode, Paul does not know what the countdown consists of and what episodes are where and where they are in the rankings.

Which leads to wonderful surprises some years.

And one year, maybe last year- It's bitter disappointments.

It's bitter disappointments.

Now, if I'm not in the final seven episodes- Right.

I'm going to be very angry.

Okay, should I tell you now?

No, no.

Okay, but you're just telling me- I'm telling you now.

Oh, sure.

All right, we need to take a break.

When we come back, we are going to have an episode which has become a yearly tradition.

Every once in a while, we have- I know what this is.

Oh, every once in a while, we'll do an episode every single year around the same time.

We have one of those.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

Paul of Tomkins is over here.

Comedy bang bang.

Paul of Tomkins.

That makes sense.

Comedy bang bang.

Paul of Tomkins.

Kapal, Kapal, Kapal, Kapal.

Kaskal.

Welcome back.

We're counting down your top 16 episodes this year of 2017.

And we just heard episode number eight with Tatiana and Christian from Orphan Black.

And I hear that movie stronger.

She's really good in.

I never got to see it.

About the Boston Marathon bombing?

Yeah, it's the Pre-Fontaine, you know, where two movies, The Deep Impact to the Armageddon.

Where Patreons Day- So there was stronger in this Patriots Day, yeah.

Yeah, exactly.

For some reason, they were just like, they came out at the same time.

I hear she's very good in that.

I want to check it out.

I'll always go with the Mark Wahlberg choice though.

Yeah, that's true.

If it's a thing where it's like Wahlberg or what's his nuts?

Who is this guy anyway?

Jason.

Heyman?

Jason Bourne?

Who started this film?

What's his name?

Jason Link.

Linkedin?

Linkedin.

Jason Linkedin.

Yeah.

I always go with the wall.

What about this, all the money in the world, right?

Where they replaced Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer.

Yeah.

But they left Mark Wahlberg in there.

Yeah, what the fuck?

It's like, hey, if you're going back in, if you're rolling up your shirt sleeves, take walls out of this.

Right.

But he's wearing glasses, so I think he's playing a smart person.

I don't know.

You know, when he asked for forgiveness for Boogie Nights.

He asked for forgiveness.

Yeah, he hopes God forgives him for making Boogie Nights.

Come on, man.

There's so many other things.

Yeah.

About it.

There's good vibrations.

God's.

Is your Calvin Klein ad?

Is your third nipple?

He has a third nipple.

Yes.

Where?

On his chest.

On chest?

Yeah.

Where?

Like right in the center?

No, not right in the center.

Oh, that's a dream.

I think it's like under one of his pectorals.

Oh, god damn it.

Yeah, which means he's a creature from hell.

Speaking of hell, let's hear.

A hell of a good episode.

Thank you.

Pulling my fat from the fire.

Spill in.

This is your episode seven.

All right, episode seven.

I mentioned before the break that this has become a yearly tradition.

Yes.

And you said you thought you knew what it was.

I thought I did.

What is your Gestimation?

I'm not going to say.

Uh oh.

You tell me what it is, and then I'll tell you what I thought it was.

I will tell you, I'll tell you, it is an episode from April 10th.

Does that give you any?

No.

Uh, episode 481.

Much like our last episode, these were pre-episode 500.

And usually in April, what comes out in April in HBO, but it is a little show called Silicon Valley.

Oh sure.

Okay.

Was that what you were thinking?

No, it was not.

Yeah, you were not thinking of that.

No, it was not.

I was thinking of something else.

This is an episode called Silly Con Valley Pooh Crew 3.

And now what happens every year is, three of the stars of Silicon Valley, you have Camille Nanjiani, who also was in The Big Sick this year.

A great film in my top 10 of the year.

You have Martin Starr?

Yep.

We know him from so many, can you, how many great shows has Martin Starr been on?

Silicon Valley, Freaks or Geeks?

And Partie Down.

Like those three.

And Partie Down.

Can you imagine having a career where you're on three of the greatest comedies?

How about Lavaa Burton, my friend who was on Star Trek, Ring Ringbo and Roots?

Well, I mean, yeah, Roots, Roots I guess counts.

Did you do show?

Did you, I mean it was in many series.

It's not a show show.

It was on television more than an episode.

When did you see Roots for the first time?

When I was a child.

When you, really a little boy.

Yes, it was a little boy.

It's just a little little wee laugh.

Is there a much short pants?

I just think shot in my pocket.

You had mustache aspirations.

Mustache abrasives.

We sat in high school.

No, sorry, junior high.

Junior high.

And I honestly, maybe I was a dumb kid or just self-centered or, you know, grew up in Orange County in lower middle class.

I mean, my parents were simple country folk, but...

You were like, why don't we have slaves now?

No, I didn't.

I guess I knew...

What a great system.

That's when the country was less good.

Roy Moore.

Get the fuck out of here.

Families stick together.

Did I...

Oh, there's an engineer Cody Sam is showing me his third nipple.

That's right.

That could...

Mark Wallberg's not Sam's.

By the way, you have a text from Brett Morris saying, nice.

Thanks.

Did you send him that picture?

Yeah, interesting.

Nice.

Thanks.

Got a little J.O. material.

I guess when I saw Roots, I knew that...

I guess I knew technically what slaves...

That there was slavery or whatever, but...

I don't know.

I just...

I didn't know the ins and outs of it, I guess.

You know what I mean?

The logistics, yeah.

No, but I guess I didn't know about the capturing and the ships and boy.

It was eye openings.

Check out Roots if you...

If you want a little more info about a terrible time in...

United States history.

But is that possible that I could have spent 12 years on the planet without real...

Like kind of technically...

Absolutely, that's possible.

Sure.

Just technically knowing what slavery was.

I don't know if I could grasp...

I don't know.

I don't know when I became aware of slavery.

Yeah.

But I mean, I guess up till then I had thought like...

Oh, it's like employees that you forced to be there, or maybe that was the extent of what I thought about it, but I never thought about like, well, how do they get them?

How...

You know, terrible stuff.

But Lavaar Burton, great in that.

Terrific.

He should be in something else, shouldn't he?

Yeah, he should be.

He's terrific.

We should put him in something.

I don't know what I mean, people should put us in something.

Yes, why aren't they fucking doing this?

Moving on from slavery to solipsism.

I'm glad we got back on track.

Silicon Valley, Pooh Crew 3, what happens every year?

This is the third year in a row when Silicon Valley comes rolling around.

These three gentlemen are nice enough to promote it, and Zach Woods is nice enough to ignore all emails...

regarding it.

I heard that he does not like to do podcasting.

I heard that too.

Who knows?

It's a shame.

He's missing out on a lot of fun.

It's a lot of fun.

And he's such a great improviser.

Have you ever improvised on stage with him?

No, never have, and I never will.

That's a good policy.

Because no, I mean...

It's honest.

I've been in some shows mainly Ben Schwartz's improv shows where...

Snow pants?

Snow pants, yeah.

Lasted one with Adam Scott.

It was the two of us together, and man, he's good.

Yeah, that's what I hear.

He's one of these improvisers.

I think Seth Morris is like this, where a lot of improvisers kind of...

their minds go to the same kind of things.

It's like pee-poo-poo.

Poo-poo-dicks, pussies.

But Zach Woods, man, the things he thinks of on stage are like it's from another...

It's so fully realized and from another dimension.

Wish he would do the show.

He did the TV show.

He was great on the TV show.

But these three, Camille, Martin, and Thomas, come on the show.

And Camille has been on many, many times.

Martin Star has been on a few times as well.

But what we all love to happen is Thomas Middle-Ditch, who's another great improviser, just basically comes in and goes nuts and does insane characters that he hasn't really worked on.

I believe the first time we did it on the very first one of these yearly traditions, he didn't even know he had to do a character, and we just said, just do it.

And it was this insane person.

And this episode is no exception.

He plays Don Donaldson, who is an entrepreneur, and then it gets even crazier towards the end.

I don't want to spoil it.

Let's just hear it.

This is your episode seven.

This is SillyCon Valley, Poo Crew 3.

Number seven.

Please welcome to the show Don Donaldson.

Hi, everybody.

Pleasure to be here.

It's our pleasure to have you.

It's this is Camille.

Okay, not familiar.

What's wrong with your eyes?

You're covering your eye?

As they burn.

They burn or you have a burn.

My eyes burn.

Nothing wrong with it.

Just right now or all the time.

Yeah, pretty consistently burning, yes.

Do you mean like burning like they itch, or do you mean like literal flames?

I mean they burn.

Damn it.

What do you mean?

What do you mean literal flames?

Do you see flames coming out of my eyes?

I do.

Sometimes flames are hard to discern with a human eye.

You can't tell when a flame is there.

Sometimes they're see through.

Hey buddy.

Remind me never to go to your house.

Okay.

Oh, are you okay?

Wake up, wake up.

Sorry.

Fell asleep.

When I laugh, I fall asleep.

When you laugh, you fall asleep.

What a horrible life you must have.

Sucks.

Yeah.

That was a laugh.

Were you able to go see Trainwreck?

The movie or the book?

Either.

Would you go see a book?

I just thought he was getting caught up on the vernacular.

Oh, you thought it was my mistake?

Yes, I didn't want to embarrass you.

Okay, thank you.

I appreciate that.

Yeah, this is Martin, by the way.

Hi.

How are you?

Great.

Good, good.

Great to be here.

Great to meet you.

I'm Scott.

Great to meet you too.

Yeah, welcome to the show.

Great.

If you need you guys, by the way, if any of you guys need a sort of like a ill air filter.

Sort of like an air filter?

An air purifier for your home.

It needs sort of an air filter.

Well, I was shopping online on Amazon.com, and I saw all these air filters, purifiers.

You know, big units you could put in your home, plug in and get nice air.

Sure.

I thought I could make one of those.

Oh, you made it.

Yeah, I got to buck in some hoses and bunches and if you breathe right through the hose, you get nice clean air.

And mine are only 25 bucks.

Okay.

As opposed to the ones that are hundreds of dollars.

Hundreds.

You get two of them, you could easily rack up a thousand dollar bill.

And you're going to need two for your whole home.

How many of you, yours do we need for the whole home?

Four to six.

Okay, so, but that's still 150 bucks.

Well, you think you have to- I didn't come here to do math.

Yeah, does it depend on how many house guests you have?

Because everyone needs their own hose.

Yeah, you need to breathe in.

You need to carry it around.

But it's a communal experience.

You've been to a hook-up art, no doubt.

Yeah.

Good. Good.

So we're all on the same page.

We're all speaking the same language.

Yes, we are.

Yeah, we are. We are.

Good.

So you've been to a hook-up?

It's okay.

I'm fine.

You're fine.

You're in a safe place.

I'm in a safe place.

Sorry.

I'm excited is my point.

Okay.

Because the world is full of opportunities.

That's my point.

The world is full of opportunities.

True.

For an entrepreneur?

Do you mean?

Yes.

Entrepreneur.

Inventor.

Oh, are you an inventor?

I've applied to be on Shark Tank, haven't I?

Oh, yeah.

How would we know?

Have you?

Yeah, I don't know.

The answer is not yet.

Okay.

Well, let us know when you do.

I will write you an email.

There is a scot that comedypingbong.com.

Do you write emails or did you invent something that's different than email that works the same way?

You're trying to make me say that I have, aren't you?

I'm just sure in Inventor, it seems like that's something.

Well, I have.

You're trying to say that I have, well, I have.

Turns out I've built something that's different but quite the same as email.

Okay, so now my experience with email.

Yeah.

I go, I turn on my computer.

PC, personal computer.

Sure.

Or a Mac.

A personal computer is really any of the above.

Oh, okay.

You're operating system.

How many computers are used by many people?

I mean, technically my wife uses it.

Is it still a personal computer?

Yes.

If it's your own personal computer, it is a personal computer.

But I mean, she- I let her use it.

If I get a personal pizza, I'm eating that on my own.

Yeah, personal pan pizza.

You could share- You could share a- No, it's a personal pan pizza.

No, I'm just- No, I'm just- Personal or panity.

But other people could share.

Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

This is the perfect segue to my email but not email.

Okay, when I log on to email, I go on to a browser.

Yes.

I go on to something, you know, one of the clients that- Yes.

I type in my email, I press a button.

Yes.

Send, and then it pops up on someone else's personal computer.

I know how email works.

Okay, okay.

How does your email- Well, the personal computer debate is a perfect analogy to how my email now works.

Okay.

It's a communal experience.

It's one word at a time between a set amounts of friends.

You get purple into your friends list.

And then- Sorry?

Purple?

You get purple into your friends list.

And then whenever you want to send an email, you invite which friends want to send an email with you.

Okay.

And then you'll contribute to the email one word at a time.

But what are you typing into?

Huh?

Is it- Are you typing into a computer? Is a computer part of this?

Not yet.

Okay.

Wait, so you get- Let me see if I can break this down.

You get- You find a friend- A set number of friends.

There is a limit.

Six friends currently.

So up to six friends.

Yes.

And they all want to have to email the same person the same thing.

Six friends, then you're on the list.

Then you send out an invite to say it'll say something like- Who wants to participate in my next email?

How do you send the invite?

Is that through a computer?

No.

Do you need a bunch of friends- And you have- Do you need a bunch of friends to send the invite?

You know social media.

They're not really your friends.

They're just people- All right, sure.

That's not the- That's not the- You're just people you know.

You think I have 26 friends?

So many followers I've got.

I've got about three actual friends.

Most of those guys I met one night in Dakota.

Self.

So you send an invite to you friends?

Yeah.

Do you- Do you have to send the invite one word at a time?

Jesus Christ.

Christ.

Yes.

That's the whole point.

Whoever responds to your invite request- Yeah.

How many people are sending more than one word at a time?

Martin.

You know what I'm saying?

He said that he every message is one word at a time.

No.

Are you writing two words at a time for your emails?

No, you're not sending- Yeah.

I'm writing a lot of words at a time.

Pardon, Martin.

By your standards I think a lot of words.

Martin.

Yeah.

You don't type a word then send, type another word then send.

That's too many emails.

Oh.

Yeah.

No.

You all get together and compose an email one word at a time.

So for you send it.

It's very easy.

We can do it right now.

Okay.

Let's do it.

All right.

Hold on.

Do you accept Martin?

Do you accept my friend request?

Scout, do you accept my friend request?

Scott.

Yes.

Scott.

Almost.

Do you accept my friend request?

Well, okay.

Great.

Global?

I didn't say yes.

Do you?

Yes.

And now- Now that another invite comes out and says, uh, Martin, do you want to participate in an email?

Scott, do you want to participate in an email?

Well, do I say it to you personally or do I- Yes, yes or no?

Yeah, yes.

But I already- You're on mail.

You're on my friend's- It's like the word email.

He needs to ask your question.

Why you ended on that one?

He don't mess up the email?

He's email.

He says, could you email?

It's email, but with the cool instead of the E.

Cool email?

Email.

Key mail.

Cornwall, I said it.

Anyway, do you want to participate in an email?

Yes.

Okay.

Great.

You're a hard sell, but then you agree.

Yes.

That's really readily.

So, uh, let's say I want to compose this email to you, Mr.

Kureji Watts.

Okay.

Oh, my former band leader.

Okay.

I'm a big fan.

Woohoo.

Have you heard of me before this?

We got to hear this impression.

Oh, yeah.

You know, we're doing the- Interim Reggie Watts songs.

Woohoo.

Wow, wow, wow.

And then he doesn't make loops.

Okay.

Yeah.

So you're a fan of Reggie, did you know about me before?

Who?

But, you know, he was- Scored Borkaman?

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Not a fan.

Oh!

Not particularly.

Of, uh- Scored Borkaman.

Comedy.

Is that you, yes, you?

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Anyway.

So this will be an email that Reggie Watts.

Okay.

Dear, and then you say something, Morgan.

Reggie.

Perfect.

Goodbye.

I don't know what to add.

No, no.

Yeah.

That's too many words.

Wait, wait, why did I get- Too many words.

Too many words.

The- You got a- You told me that I was going to be part of the email.

Yeah, but you didn't need to be.

It was only three letters.

What's this- Three words.

We're doing here if you're not- Well, thanks for coming.

Yeah, thank you, Matt.

To have it back.

It's- Well, you said I was going to be part of the email.

It's kind of- It's kind of- All right, stand.

What?

No, I didn't get a- No, I didn't get a- Does this happen?

Is it about making people feel bad?

No, you just gotta go with a flow.

That's the point of a whole email.

Let's try another one.

Okay.

All right, you want to start this one off, Martin?

Okay, who do we send it to?

Who are we sending it to?

Yes, up to you guys.

Who do you want to send an email?

We have to all agree on who- What if one of us just wants to send an email?

But first, it's a person who invites- So first, you have to invite everybody.

Okay, I'm going to say I want to- Sorry, I skipped a step.

Go ahead and invite us all.

But we're already friends, so I don't need to do that again.

Exactly.

Okay.

What kind of network we've already done that?

Shut.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Sorry, it's just like- It's okay.

It's just frustrating.

You're always explaining.

Scout, do you accept my- I do.

My email request.

Yep.

It's like I'm on the bachelor's.

Kermel, do you accept- Yeah.

Don?

Yes, of course.

In the lunges.

Right.

Actually, wait a second.

Let me just check my calendar.

Is it occurring right now?

I guess time.

Okay, great, great.

Okay.

Whoa.

Okay, so start- I've found that in a- It's a nice spine.

That was like a raptor or something.

What the fuck was that?

Sorry, I have day apnea.

Go.

Day apnea.

Wait, what happens at night?

Oh, wake apnea.

I breathe clear of the baby.

You know, in a womb.

I don't do well.

So you have a lot of fluid in your lungs?

It's a tremendous amount of fluid.

It's like the abyss.

You know, when they get this.

Sure.

Yeah.

Well, you know, we all- Bro- Hey, you're gonna let Martin say- He's a man.

We're not.

Okay, so let's send the email to- Start- John Goodman.

John Goodman.

All right.

Deer.

R.

What?

He mentioned deer.

Wait, wait, hold on.

Deer.

R.

What?

Deer.

Beautiful.

You said what?

Yeah, you said what?

Okay.

So that's a question mark after that.

Deer.

R. What?

Yeah.

How do we decide punctuation?

How?

You say it.

That cancels your word.

Okay, so this is still the first sentence.

Deer R. What, how?

Okay, great.

Calm.

Deer R. How, what, calm?

What, how, what, how, calm?

Deer R. What, how, calm?

Calm?

Like C-A-L-A-C-A-M.

The computer is registering all this.

You have to understand that when it comes to you, the first thing you say is what's going to be put in.

Okay.

Period.

All right, let me make sure that algorithm's up and right.

Yep.

You got the algorithm?

Oh, so you got it on a computer now?

Yeah, well, not.

That's up here.

Oh, wait, you're running an algorithm in your brain.

Oh, no, not any yet.

Please help me.

Come.

Right now.

Exclamation point.

Okay.

Oh, wait, that's my word.

Okay.

There are several.

Little.

Spurns.

In.

This.

Ball cage.

Is that one word?

It's a hyphened?

We'll let it go.

Okay, thank you.

How?

Still no punctuation.

Do.

You all, y'all.

Semi-colon.

I can't believe.

Not.

Barry.

Sand.

Oh, wow.

So, it's just sand.

Whoever says sand gets to decide when to send it.

What if you have to type the word?

I got it.

I got to be honest.

There was no clarifying that.

There was no way out of that.

Okay, well, isn't that a problem with your system then?

I don't know.

Shouldn't we have all decided what we wanted to say to John Goodman?

Yeah, when you have an email to send to someone, presumably you know what you want to say, and then suddenly you're bringing your friends in and muddying the whole issue.

We're doing the initial round of fundraising or series days.

Oh, this is what this is about.

Okay.

You guys want to get in, you can't.

You're talking to three television stars here.

I'm just saying I'm being very generous when I say that about myself.

I know you got money in the bank account.

I know you're probably just sitting on some savings, so.

I get it to you.

Look, I like to be comfortable.

I don't like to worry about money.

So yeah, I got a little something sucked away.

I don't understand what the technology is behind this.

When we're putting in money.

Yeah, we already own computers.

What are we putting this money towards?

To buy new computers?

Yeah, you want to get nuts and bolts to this kind of stuff and bore everybody a list.

No, we do.

We want to get into the next.

Yeah, if we're going to put money into this.

This is theoretical stuff.

This is bleeding as technology.

It's not all going to be written down.

So wait, are we paying for the algorithm in your head?

What are we paying for?

Didn't you enjoy your experience?

Are we supposed to pay?

Didn't you enjoy your experience?

Sure.

Didn't you got to have a choice?

Put the knife away.

Okay, okay.

I'm just saying.

Oh, if you want trouble, we can make trouble.

Let's deescalate this situation, sir.

That's fine.

That's fine, sir.

Just give me that.

That's fine, sir.

I just seen things earlier.

I've seen things earlier in my life that I'd rather forget.

Everything's going to be cool.

Everything's fine.

We were just literally trying to find out what our money was going towards.

But that's fine, sir.

The future.

Idiot.

God, we'll speak on the show.

Speaking of the future.

Let's talk about its direct opposite, the past.

Great.

What are some of these things that you've seen in your life?

How old of a man are you?

How old do I look?

To be honest, somewhere between two and 80?

Yeah, pretty close.

Pretty close.

61 years old.

So you were born in the 50s as...

Yeah, what year were you born in?

As Sting, aka Gordon Sumner once said.

If you were 61, what year were you born in then?

I just got to think.

No, come on.

You should know what year...

I know, I just got to think.

56, 2017.

The King of Rock and Roll had just come out a scant few months earlier.

Oh, yeah.

It was 1956.

He'd come out with that old, you ain't nothing but a hound dog.

Dog.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

So you must have heard that as a baby.

As a baby, yeah.

But I'm as a man.

Never as a man.

Never heard it as a man.

That's why I don't really know that well.

Sorry.

I don't mean to bring up something that you don't know.

That's fine.

Okay.

I wouldn't put...

I wouldn't hold bad against you.

Okay, so now in 56...

You're probably too young to have gone to the Vietnam War unless you went as a young person and what about your...

In 1966, I was 10 years old.

Right.

Okay.

And in 1968, I was 12.

Got it.

And that is when I went to Vietnam.

Yeah, as a 12 year old boy.

I went on a student visa.

Oh, you chose to visit.

It was a student exchange program.

And there was one person on the US side, me, who signed up and one person on the Vietnam side, Dongpok, who signed up.

And we exchanged and we met once in the airport and I never saw him again.

He seemed like a nice boy at the time.

I remember thinking, I hope I get to play with him.

What is surprise you to know that he's on the phone right now?

He's calling in.

Dongpok is on the phone.

Here he is.

I know this is a surprise to you, but I set it up beforehand.

He's here on the phone with you.

Oh.

Hello, Dong, are you there?

Wow, he's laughing on.

Hello?

Hi.

Who is this?

This is Scott Ocarman, the host.

Oh, I've got...

Of comedy bang bang.

We...

Comedy bang bang.

I love it.

Ooh.

You do.

You're a fan.

Yeah.

It's great.

Hey, we have great news for you.

Do you remember when you were around 12 years old, you had an exchange program with the American?

Uh huh.

Don Donaldson?

Okay.

That little boy.

Thank you, uncle.

Well, he's not a little boy anymore.

He aged at the same rate you did.

Hmm?

He's the same age as you.

Oh, yeah.

We're both 61-year-old.

Oh, God.

Okay, Dong.

How well do you know what I am, Dong?

Do you know?

I'm Vietnam's leading lady boy.

Ooh.

All right.

All right, Dong.

No, I run a whole lady boy shop.

Okay, let's...

I'm afraid we don't have that much time.

What is that lady boy shop?

Ooh, come in.

You're shop for the lady boy.

They come out with you.

Okay.

Don't you want to come and be a deal?

We don't.

I'm Dong.

It's...

Don't...

Who else is on the line?

Well, yeah.

Dong Donaldson is on the line.

Yeah, oh boy.

Hey there, how are you?

Dong fucks me.

Dong Donaldson.

Oh, it's all pleasure to see hear your voice again.

Come to Vietnam.

We have great time together.

All right, I'll see you in a bit.

Bye.

Look me up, lady boy.

Premier, Premier Lady Boy Service.

Is there a website we can go to?

www.premierladyboyservice.com.

Okay, thank you, it's so great to talk to you.

I think, kind of please, just do demonstration.

I thought this was...

No, I thought it was good.

Please, my big shot, please, on radio.

Wait, what's the demonstration?

Of my singing?

Oh, yes.

You won't see it if you come here.

Okay, I guess so.

I really don't know how much longer we go ahead.

I...

Okay, that's about all we have time for.

Thank you so much.

Thank you.

Oh, Dong, what a thrill.

Oh, I gotta be.

Oh, it seems like a pretty fun guy.

Number seven.

And there you have it.

That's a little glimpse inside the twisted mind of Thomas Middleditch.

I mean, this guy's crazy.

This guy's crazy.

He's crazy.

He's crazy about you.

Thomas, great guy.

Like a legitimately insane person.

He's your arch enemy, so...

Yeah, so like I think he's okay.

You'll never forgive him for taking the top spot last year.

Never.

But at a certain point, you gotta give it up.

No, here's me.

I carry these things around inside me forever.

Oh, I forgot about that.

Yeah, right.

Have you seen him personally since then?

He was at a party I had recently.

I literally saw him there, but did not speak with him.

And you avoided him?

I did like to play.

How do you avoid the plague, by the way?

I mean, I guess you don't like sleep on pillows that someone coughed on.

Yeah.

Like what it's almost like people are...

That's honestly that's all you have to do.

Don't sleep on pillows, don't wear this coughed on.

But it's like someone's like, you can outrun it or something.

Don't fuck a rat.

Hey, if you're fucking a rat, don't fuck a rat.

Great advice here in 2018.

All right, we need to take a break.

When we come back, we will have a very interesting episode with the debut of a new character.

This is nuts.

debut of a new character for something that landed as number six on our countdown.

This is incredible.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're counting it down, Paul of Tonkins across, for me, across the table, as he has so often been in the eight and a half years we've been doing this program, has quite often sat right where he's sitting right now.

How many times have we done this?

Done the best ofs?

Or best ofs?

It is the eighth year of the show.

Right?

We have the eighth anniversary.

Does that make it the ninth best of?

I feel like we've done this before.

Okay, so the show started in 2009.

Sure.

We had one in 2009, 2010, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

This is the ninth best of for our eighth.

We've been going eight and a half years.

So I feel like we didn't do it the first.

I mean, I know we did best of the first couple of years, but I think I just hosted it.

Right.

This is maybe the seventh year we've been doing it.

I don't know.

Lucky seven.

Lucky number seven.

Just the other day.

All right, let's get to it.

All right.

This is very exciting.

We're heading into the very upper echelon of our countdown.

This is, this is episode, this is your episode number six.

Number six.

And I mentioned Paul, this is the debut of a new character.

You mentioned this was the debut of another character.

And this is exciting.

I mean, could you have any clue as to what this could be?

Is it somebody from Clue?

It's, yes, well, it's Mike McKeean's character from Clue.

He was playing a character the whole time as the gay FBI character, who then turned out to be straight in the, I believe episodes, or ending number C, where the very last line of Clue is, he reveals that he was playing a gay, that he, that was a character, and he turns to everyone and says, and now I'm going home to sleep with my wife.

And then it frees frames on him.

Like that's the happy ending.

I've never seen that movie.

It's, it's Neil Patrick Harris was talking about it.

It's one of his, I think it's his favorite movie.

I think it was his favorite movie.

Yeah, it's a very interesting film.

I almost blurted out that can't be true.

You see another movie.

But I know, but I know someone from another friend of mine loves that movie.

And I think it is her favorite comedy.

It's interesting.

It is a like typical drawing room comedy.

It's not really a scary movie or about the mystery.

It's about the interactions between characters.

Well, Mike and Mikey, doesn't he play one of the Clue characters?

Yeah, but he's, but he's revealed in one of the endings he reveals he was an FBI agent.

I foreign all of the versions.

I think in one version, he figures out who did it, reveals that he's an FBI agent and not the gay.

I think he's Professor Plum, maybe?

I'm not sure.

But he reveals that he's been playing a character the whole time, and he solves the crime.

I see.

Mm-hmm.

Interesting.

Very interesting.

Well.

And speaking of interesting, let's talk about this interesting episode.

This is another recent-ish episode.

This is from October 9, just this past October.

And no need to hunt for it because this is an episode number 512 called What's Your Aim?

What's Your Aim?

And Paul, would it surprise you?

I believe it would because you have a look of confusion.

To know that you're in this episode.

It would surprise me.

This is Bobby Moynihan.

Oh, sure.

And yourself.

Okay.

In an episode where Bobby Moynihan premiered- Aim, of course.

Aim, meaning the AOL instant messenger.

That's right.

We were talking about it on the show.

That's right.

Uh, Bobby Moynihan premiered his character slow-peashing.

Yes, that's right.

And you were playing Werner Herzog.

That's correct.

And Werner had not been on the show in quite a while since the tour brought us.

It has been quite a file.

And it's always great to hear from Werner Herzog.

You had mentioned to me that you had sort of stopped doing him for a while, so I was surprised when you said you wanted to do him.

Yeah, because he became Werner- He's like a meme now.

Yeah, Werner Herzog became like a meme and it sort of took the fun out of it for me.

Right, when everyone thinks it's possible- Yeah.

Possible.

Well, they think it's possible.

But you want people to think things are impossible.

A bunch of Icarus' out here.

They're wax wings.

That when everyone thinks it's like, Oh, hilarious how Werner Herzog talks.

Yeah.

It's not as fun that you have been doing it for years.

Yes.

Like maybe or nine years at this point.

So, but we love to hear from him.

And this episode turned out to be sort of an AirSods sequel to the Time Bobby episode stream, which is not what we were intending to do.

No, not at all.

We went into it just saying, Hey, let's do something different.

I think I texted you saying, I think Bobby is not doing four-ville, by the way.

He wants to do a different character, so don't feel like you need to prepare Andrew Lloyd Webber.

And you said, great, I'm going to do Werner Herzog.

And then it sort of at the end segues into being a sequel to the popular Time Bobby series, Time Bobby 1 through 4, which have all popped up on our four of them.

Yes.

And each has ended up on the countdown.

Very popular comedy bang bang series.

This turned out to be somewhat of a sequel by the end.

I don't believe we're going to play the end.

I'm not quite sure.

But let's hear a little bit of this episode.

This is Bobby Moynihan.

We all know him from Saturday Night Live.

Just left the cast to be in the CBS sitcom Me, Myself, and I, which he just left that as well for a totally different reason.

And but great.

One of our good friends and I love having the three of you.

I guess when I say the three of you, I mean you and Bobby and me.

This is your episode six.

This is what's your aim?

Number six.

What about that?

That would be slow, passy.

Would it be something if we were to like just slow?

You can go me slow.

Just slow.

Okay.

What if we were.

You know what?

Go me slow, passy.

Slow, passy.

You know what?

Call me Gary.

Why'd you?

Rest in peace.

Did you ever meet Gary Marshall?

Oh, yeah.

Well, I don't know if meat is the right word.

What is the right word?

I was in the same room when a guy got shot when Gary Marshall was there.

A guy got shot.

What's with the circumstances?

See, my brother's an actor, you know, and I got to make the bills.

You know, I got to pay these things.

So I was in the mafia for a little bit.

You were in the mafia.

Yeah, it was a hitman.

And whoa.

And I got a, you know, you don't get a phone call or not.

Then you get a little piece of paper with an aim on it and you go and you kill that dude.

So.

Wow.

Yeah.

So I.

You said name, right?

Not aim.

I'm sorry.

You said name on it.

No, you get a name with an aim on it.

You get the AOL instant messenger handles.

Yeah.

That's what I got.

And you have to do all the work figuring out.

Yeah, I got to go through.

I got to go find an old computer.

Hope that thing up.

Booty, booty.

I got to say, past November, you're not, you're going to be out of work.

Oh, yeah.

That's why I'm trying to, that's why I'm over here.

Yeah.

Wolf trying to bust a piss and trying to get something going on.

Right.

So you do know where you are.

Uh, it will studio.

Yeah.

OK, great.

So now I came here specifically.

I'm trying to get my career off the ground.

I'm trying to, trying to put it on the fairish track.

You may have come to the wrong place.

Oh, yeah.

You believe.

Yeah, it seems like I'm more of a plateau.

Yeah, you just kind of, but not, but my bad.

You know, but well, but you're just going to like, do you like coasting?

Yes, sure.

That's my favorite thing to do.

Are you kidding me?

I like, I'm like, my, my life is like a nice lazy river.

Great.

How, how passionately can you talk about mattresses?

What's here?

Ladies and gentlemen, I took a, I took a little nap this morning.

I'm a beautiful case for my trees.

And it was glorious.

We're, we're a Lisa show here.

We're a Lisa show.

I, that's what I said.

Lisa.

Lisa, Casper's Italian for Lisa.

All right.

What do you think about microbes?

Just in general.

I, yeah.

This is not important.

I think we all know what I think about my.

Your anti.

I'm doing a duties hand gesture again.

That's what I thought.

Okay.

So you got an aim handle.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And I get there and you know, I see the name and I do all the tracking.

I figure it out and I get there and I'm like, all right, it's time.

Slowly you got to do this.

This is your job.

This is your little jib jib.

You got to go in and do this.

So I take out the pistol.

Was jib jib part of your research?

Is this how you tracked it?

Yeah, it was a jib jib.

That's what I was about.

So how I found him.

Yeah, that helped.

And you see the face on top of like an animated body dance.

Yeah, yeah.

And I'm looking around and everybody's body is real.

So I'm like, okay, you can arrange that.

That's not the way to do it.

So then I see the guy and I'm about to plug him right in the back of the neck.

Right.

In the back of the truck.

Is that what you hit man's style?

Oh, no.

It's the worst idea.

It causes the most blood.

It's the most sound.

Sometimes you hit the spine.

Sometimes you know, you miss it.

Yeah.

Straight through.

There you live.

But you know, you only live one.

Interesting, right?

Well, we're going to do pop the guy in and go catch a movie real quick.

No man.

Let's not be stupid over here.

All right.

So you, especially you, especially me.

Hey, come on.

I said no teaming up against me.

All right.

So I go to pop him in the neck.

I got the gun right against the back of his neck.

He doesn't know it's coming.

Gary Marshall comes over and says, hi, Shakes is handy.

He's a friend of Gary Marshall.

Oh, wait.

Is this actor Elisondo?

It was Hector Elisondo.

Whoa.

Gary Marshall's good luck charm Hector Elisondo.

He's so Gary Marshall saved Hector Elisondo's life.

I mean, probably many times, but in this situation, yeah.

I would think it would be vice versa.

And that's why Gary keeps putting him in films.

But no.

He does it to protect him.

Wow.

So he'll always be around him.

Yeah, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, almost never leaves his side.

Do you have a little side car built on his, on his own body?

Really?

Like a, like a Batman and Robin style?

Yeah, he, Gary Marshall, you, but you don't see him in interviews.

And they're usually because it's only from, you know, like chest up, but down on his side is a little side car.

Hector Elisondo is sitting there.

Come to think of it anytime I've seen an interview with Gary Marshall.

It's always been chest up.

He's a never occurred to me.

He's always like a lower that, and the reason is Hector Elisondo is in a whiny side car attached to his body right next to him.

Is it, is the side car made of some kind of organic material that is grafted on this?

It's like a human flesh, gankaroo, bug it.

Well, Werner, I have a pitch for you.

You're a current film director.

That's correct.

And you will be until you die.

Yes.

Assuming you are still working on something.

You may die in the next couple of days, in which case you would be a former film director.

I may die in the next couple of minutes.

Yeah, what, what, yeah, yeah, yeah, by the way.

Oh, no, no, no.

You don't want to kill him.

Is that why you came here?

Nah.

Did someone put a hit out on?

Nah, I came here to bust a piss.

I'm just curious what, uh, what, uh, you're right.

I am now.

Can you slow, slow pressure?

You seem to have, uh, many different stories as to why you come to be here in the earwool studio.

I don't think that's true.

It's, you said it's to bust a piss.

It's, uh, you said it's to, uh, launch some sort of career.

Well, I mean, that's a, that's a B story, you best.

Uh, I worry that, uh, your true purpose here is more sinister than you have let on.

Ah, come on.

What are you, what are you talking about?

Yeah, I don't know.

I'm a little bit of a...

Yeah.

Uh, who told you about the earwool studio?

The earwool studio is here.

Why?

I mean, everybody, the word on the street, everybody's talking about it.

People on the street.

Yeah, well, you walk down Hollywood Boulevard, everyone's like, earwool, how will you?

You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know.

So, I mean, I'm sort of with Werner here.

I mean, we've been getting along so well.

So, well, uh, but at this point now, I might have to change allegiances.

Which you're, uh, what's my...

What's my...

Slow, slow, slow, uh, slow.

Slow it?

What?

Like a taxi?

Yeah.

Would you, uh, would you excuse us for one moment?

We have to have a...

We're gonna quickly go over here.

You can join us very slowly, if you like, but we're...

It's gonna take me a while, yeah.

It's gonna take you a while.

You're gonna make some weird...

We will walk over at normal pace to the other side of the room.

Yeah, sure.

I'll just be working on a beer.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'll sweat, I'll sweat.

Alright.

Say, Werner, I'm starting to suspect that, uh, slow...

Pesci.

I wanna say slow, Joe.

Yes, I do too, for some reason.

For some weird reason.

Yes.

But it's slow Pesci.

It's slow Pesci.

It's a different guy.

I'm a different guy.

Wait, can you hear us?

It's just...

No, I just heard...

I thought you said slow Pesci, so I came over.

Oh, you're here already.

We gotta move quite...

I'm here to get further away.

Sorry, I won't bother away this time.

So, so, Werner.

Yes.

I think what it is, is that there's a fellow named Joe Pesci.

And, uh, his name is Slow Pesci, but, uh, it's the Joe...

It's the Joe...

Joe, he wants to follow...

But there's some reference to Slow Joey that I'm...

That's in the back of my mind for some reason.

I wonder if I want to say Slow Joe Pesci.

We could say Slow Joe Pesci, if you want, but it seems almost harder to say this.

Oh, sorry, yes.

I don't want to misrepresent...

As a side conversation...

Oh, shit, he's here.

All right, let's go.

He's so close.

All right, let's get away even quicker.

Okay, so as a side conversation...

I feel like Slow Pesci.

That was definitely the main conversation.

Oh, yes, that was definitely what we wanted to say.

This is now the side conversation.

This is the side one.

I feel like Slow...

I feel as if we are on the same page.

Why don't we hit the count of three?

We will say at the same time what we think.

Okay, okay.

One, two, three.

I think Slow Pesci is here to murder us.

I was going to say one of us, but then you said us.

He asked for both of our AIM handles.

Do you think that he...

He's here to murder both of us?

Have that never even crossed my mind?

I would say it's like a twofer?

It could be a twofer.

I wonder if he gets paid for one.

What day of the week is it?

It's Tuesday.

Oh my god, it's two for Tuesday.

Two for Tuesday.

Oh my god.

Oh wait, he's here.

Oh, they also could be double shot Tuesday.

Oh, that's true.

All right.

Sounds even worse.

How'd it go?

How'd the conversation go?

We didn't really have a conversation.

We were just walking.

Because you look like you're having a conversation.

You look a little scared.

They were saying, look how so little about you were dug.

It was the same time.

I think we were both the gums a little bit.

Yes, we were guarding against Lock Shaw.

Yeah.

Yeah, I know that's good.

Doing our exercises.

Yeah.

You know, I was just over here busting a pest just being slowy, jello, peshy over here.

You seem to have a bit of a bladder problem.

Yeah, all I do is drink water.

With non-delivery.

Yeah, you die.

I think so too.

I thought that too.

I stopped and then I said, oh, what a.

And you waggled your eyebrows up and down.

You love that shit.

Yeah, amazing.

Sesopeshy.

We have a couple of concerns.

Yeah, I had a couple of questions that I asked you that you still haven't answered yet.

But what are your concerns?

It seemed to be the same question, but directed at both of us separately.

Yeah, well, all right.

Still a couple of questions.

That's two questions.

It might be the same, but they were a couple.

Slow, slow, peshy.

I'd like to ask you a question.

I hope I can rely on your transferness.

The kind of some strangers.

You can always rely on that.

That goes without saying.

Always.

Always assume.

I hope I can rely on the kindness of strangers.

Certainly.

But I do hope that you will be honest with me when answering my query.

Yeah, I'm straight-shooting.

Complete candor.

That's what we require of you.

Yeah, yeah.

No.

Proverications.

No dodging.

Beering the bush.

No beating around the bush.

Are you here to murder us?

Yes.

I barely even finished asking the question.

He was like, he really wanted to tell us.

The fastest he's ever done anything was answered that question.

That's incorrect.

Wait, I'm sorry.

I actually just answered a question from hours earlier.

Oh, wait.

Are all of your answers from questions?

It's pretty much.

I'm slow.

You're on like taping away?

Yeah, so sometimes, you know, when I got to think about something, it don't come out till a couple hours later.

Somebody asked me the other day, they were like, hey, you ever have a Brussels sprout?

Don't know.

That.

You were answering that when you said yes.

Question, because yes, I love those things.

Okay.

Now, what was your question?

Is there there must be a way to bypass the the queue of answers to the questions?

Like I say, in an elevator where you could press a secret button and it might be just a applause.

Exactly.

Yes.

The express, if we could get the express answers, is there some way that we could do this, that we can achieve this?

In factories?

There is.

Now, I don't know if he's answering the question.

I just asked her if he's answering another question.

Did someone ask you a question?

Something different about eggplant or?

Yeah, a couple days ago.

A couple days ago.

Okay.

Now, is that the answer to the question you just asked?

I think it may be about when he ate the said Brussels sprout.

Yeah, I was talking to Jay Davidson and he was like, Jay Davidson, you were talking to Jay Davidson from the crying game?

From the crying game, yeah.

Do you mention anything about his own personal eggplant?

Because that's the famous one?

Yeah, you know, the one that if you.

From the movies?

Yeah.

The eggplant.

Emoji.

That guy in the fucking talk's about.

Are you kidding me?

Did the quickside bar fellows?

Sure.

That between all of us.

Did the eggplant emoji appear in the emoji movie?

And did they make like knowing winking jokes about it?

Did that change the rating of the film?

Yeah, with the little water squirt right here.

Right next to it.

Yeah.

Now that's where they went wrong.

The only part that went wrong.

I'm gonna go see it today.

Yes.

Okay.

And thus ends our side conversation.

Let's get back to the regular one.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

To answer your question.

Yeah.

How do we how do we bypass the and get to the head of the queue?

Maybe if you would state the question that you are answering and then we would know which question is being answered.

That's a yes.

Great system.

How do you mean?

I feel like he's answering Jay Davidson's questions again.

I wish we knew how long this conversation with Jay Davidson went on.

Asked me how to get to a Best Buy and I didn't understand what he made.

You didn't understand Best Buy?

No, I said, hey, you mean?

Or why a big star like him would be?

Well, I don't know why he's got to go to a Best Buy.

Meeting discounts.

Yeah, exactly.

Maybe once a great deal on a big screen TV.

Yeah, get yourself over to like, you know, a nicer place, you know, not like Best Buy.

Right, yeah.

Okay.

Let's step up from Best Buy.

I mean, there's no circumstance.

There's no circumstance.

Oh, there you go.

Oh, just things.

Where you want to be?

Yeah.

I met electronics, but now I'm.

So we're wondering, and we're wondering how we're ever going to find this out, we're wondering if you are here to murder us because, frankly.

Scott, yes.

What if we were to write something on the bottom of a piece of paper and then have him write the answer?

Oh, now we're talking.

That's a good idea.

Do you want to be more immediate?

Okay.

How do you want to do this?

Do you want to?

I want to take a piece of paper.

Good.

That's a great start.

Right.

Right on the bottom of it.

Yeah.

How do we choose?

Exactly.

You just said now you're just explaining it.

Yeah.

Where's more?

Who gets to choose who's going to write what though?

Or you do you want to?

Well, first, slow past sheet.

I almost said slow Joey again.

Would you please excuse us?

Slowy Joey.

If you want to.

Slowy Joey.

Sure.

Why not?

Do you do?

Will you excuse us for a second?

Uh, yes.

Oh boy.

Oh my god.

This movie's so long.

All right.

Okay.

What question?

We should ask him the question.

Who sent you to murder us?

Or does he get paid for two?

That's why.

Well, I'm really interested in that.

I feel as if we must find out why this is happening.

Perhaps we should ask him a question like, will you please not murder us?

Oh, that's a great question.

What if he says no and then murders us?

That's the fear.

Will you please not murder us?

Parentheses, you can't say no.

All right.

Look, I'm willing to try it.

It's worth a try.

Okay.

So here's a piece of paper, obviously.

Obviously here's a piece of paper.

All right.

Very soft.

Why did you crop little?

What do you know this thin paper?

Very soft thin paper.

I know he's caught up with us.

He'll run away again.

I was writing while I ran and now I've smeared the question.

What does it say now?

It says, will you please murder us?

Oh, no.

Well, let's give it to him.

Why?

Just see what would happen?

I feel as if you have just caved too soon.

Let's hear that one up then.

Let's hear.

Give me another piece of paper.

Another piece of that thin paper that I love so much.

Will you please not murder us?

Parenthesis.

Yes.

Thank you.

Okay.

I just want to make sure you remember that part.

You cannot say no.

And parentheses question mark.

Yes.

Perfect.

Let's run back over.

Okay.

Hey, hey.

Hey, what's going on?

So, Maggie.

It's lowy-joy.

We have a piece of paper with a question on it for you.

We have thoughtfully put the question at the bottom.

And here is a pen you can write your answer down.

Thank you very much.

That's a nice pen.

Thank you.

It's like a $3,000 pen.

It was a gift from Klaus Kinsky.

Really?

Can you a pen?

Yes.

In my heart, it nearly killed me.

Oh.

Okay.

You stand here in a home with that thing?

For my birthday.

Oh.

Happy birthday.

Thank you.

No statute of limitations.

Unhappy birthday.

Oh, that never is.

365 days a year.

Yes.

All right.

Do you want to read that piece of paper?

No.

Would you?

No.

Okay.

No.

Okay.

That's right.

Wait, was he just answering another question from Jay Davidson?

Who knows?

Yeah.

Okay.

Yes, I was.

But, Tansy, your question.

You'll hear that in a couple hours I'm guessing.

Oh.

Oh, he answered.

No.

All right.

Let's read this thing here.

Let me throw on my readers.

Those are the thickest figures.

Thickest.

I'm pretty sick.

They are.

It's terrifying how thick they are.

But there's sunglasses on the top.

These are actually a windshield from a Cessna.

Oh my god.

Yeah.

That's incredible.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You're taking a bullet.

You're burning through an egg with these things.

Wow.

We probably can't do that with a lot of things, really.

There, right.

Let me just read this right here.

He's reading it.

We've done it.

He's really reading it.

That's not stuck sucking each other's sticks just yet.

God, I'm hurt her.

No.

Guys, please feel free.

I love cinema.

Guys, please feel free if you want, by the way.

That I don't mind.

That stuff is fine with me.

All right, let's check it out.

See a little parentheses.

Oh, thank God.

He read the parentheses.

He's got the parentheses.

Oh, okay.

Hey, man.

Oh, red.

Thank you.

All right.

Would you be so kind as to write your unsanthi on the piece of paper?

I don't get you with this beautiful pen here.

You have your beautiful pen.

And then we'll read that.

And then we'll know it.

Then we'll know.

Yeah, okay.

Let me just write the answer now.

All right.

He's writing.

It's good that we came up with that thing where he can't say no.

That was perfect.

Werner, I gotta say, that was A plus.

Fold it up.

All right.

Okay.

It's even thinner now that it's folded somehow.

I can't just slide it across.

You know, they can't fold a paper more than six times in half.

I thought it was eight.

Was it eight?

Okay.

Make sure.

But you can.

You can?

You can be stupid.

You're allowed.

You'd be stupid.

Yeah, you'll be dumb to try.

You'll be dumb to try.

It's like Drake trying to drink a gallon of milk.

So everyone just gets embarrassed after eight?

Oh, God.

Once you hit that seven, you're like, what am I doing?

What am I doing?

Just because I heard this fall.

I have to be the paper.

I'm gonna drink a gallon of milk and then halfway through that, they're like, I'm a friggin' idiot.

What am I doing?

Waste.

Got time.

I'm afraid to open the paper.

Will you look at it?

Oh my God.

Your hands are shaking.

I'm trembling.

I've never seen you.

I'm trembling like a leaf.

All right.

Okay.

Let me fold one.

Why are you folding it further?

Oh, I'm trying to get to eight.

Nope.

You can't.

I'm too embarrassed.

All right.

Let me unfold it.

Good blushing.

All right.

Seven, six.

Beat five.

Four, three, two.

No, sorry.

One.

That was a close one.

That was very close.

All right.

It's been a while.

I heard that.

Will you have been quite a while?

Please not murder us parentheses.

You can't say no.

Yes, that is what to do.

That was our question.

Question mark.

Yes.

And then he has written his own son, Denise.

I'm going further down.

I, that's a promising start.

Keep going, though.

Will.

I write real slow, too.

I write so slow that you have to read it slow.

Yeah.

I will.

That's an even better start.

What's this word right after it?

Not.

I will not, period.

So the question was, will you please not murder us?

You cannot say no.

He didn't say no.

He said, I will not.

Does that mean I will not murder you?

We need clarification.

Get another one of those things.

All right, here we go.

Number six.

Oh, Paul.

We did it.

This is your fifth episode on the countdown.

That's exciting.

I'm very...

You only made 11 appearances on Comedy Bang Bang the entire year.

And five of them are in the top countdown.

I guess I, I guess I just really, I tried, I tried my heart.

You tried really hard this year.

I will say, your previous you did not try it all.

Oh, God damn it.

So now how many, what are we up to?

We're up to number six.

Number six.

That was number six.

And you've had five out of the top 16.

Okay, I'm just going to say, yeah, if I'm not in any of the remaining five episodes.

Right.

I'm going to be very angry.

Okay.

Well, you might not be.

You don't know what's happening.

That's true.

When we come back, we are going to talk about episode number five.

And this is a real nail biter.

Is Paul going to be angry?

Is Paul going to be pleased?

We don't know.

But we'll have your episode number five coming up after this break.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back here counting down the episode.

Scott Augerman here with Paul of Tompkins.

No, no, no.

Engineer Sam has given me a little bit of trivia.

And he chose to do it off mic, but I'm going to bring your dirty laundry out here.

But Paul, you have, we were talking about how many best-ups we've done together out of the nine.

The very first one was a big group of people.

But since then, we have done it together.

So eight, this is our eighth appearance.

Lucky number slate.

This is the eighth.

This is not the ninth.

This is the eighth.

My only phrase.

Mama, I want to.

Oh, you.

You didn't even have the balls to say.

What a fucking creep that guy was.

He was, wasn't he?

Did he ever read those?

Like no one here gets out alive or those bios or anything like that?

People who are obsessed with Jim Morrison.

What's that all about?

He's what a tiresome dude.

He was a handsome, I guess, for a minute.

Yeah, for a minute.

I feel like it's all like, then he got a booze bloaty.

I feel like it's handsome, model-ish actors who won an edge.

They, they read doors of perception and they love Jim Morrison.

That's right.

You know?

Jared Leto.

The good old joke.

Or why the fucking, like I sent you a box with a rat in it.

Cause I'm the Joker.

I sent you a box with a rat in it.

Cause I'm the Joker.

Jared, if you remember when Grover played the Joker.

It's so close to those names.

Grover Joker.

I'm a midnight smoker.

I'm a Grover.

Cause I'm Grover.

I'm the Joker.

Oh man.

All right.

I'm also a Bram Stoker.

This is Dracula.

This is a great parody.

We need to get to it.

We need to get to the final episode we're going to be counting down today.

This is your episode number five.

Number five.

All right.

Number five.

Boy, we're in the top five now.

It's crazy, man.

It's crazy.

This is crazy.

A lot of good episodes up till now.

A lot of good episodes.

A lot of laughs.

Open out stops.

It's all over now.

Now they're the best ones.

This stinker got in here somehow.

People voted like they were winning for a senjaya.

It's weirdly the second year in the row.

We mentioned senjaya in the voting.

We mentioned it last year.

Really?

Yeah.

We were talking about how people voted for these episodes, the ones they like.

And then you mentioned maybe some people were voting for ones they didn't like.

And we said like senjaya.

It's just see.

Here's the thing.

There's only so many things in the world.

Is this, yeah.

But I've had this experience where I'll record a podcast.

Let's say I do one with you.

And then it comes out much later.

And so I don't remember the things that were said, but I will anticipate a response.

Right.

Like somebody will say something and me listening to it in the present.

I'm like, it makes me think of this.

And then me on the recording.

I say that.

That happens all the time where I'm like, damn, I bet I missed a joke and then I'll say it.

Yeah.

And I'll be like.

It's terrifying to me.

But it's like, is that just, is that because it's buried in my memory?

I think it's no.

Or is it just the reaction I would have to trigger that whatever the person previous to you talking, whatever they said triggers the exact same thing in your brain.

Which makes you think of the exact same thing.

You are snowflake.

I was so like, you got to.

You're very unique.

You're more unique.

The most unique.

All right.

This is episode five that people voted for.

And this is from April.

So we're all over the map on these.

Thanks April.

Don't the same?

Yeah.

Thanks April.

First time long time, April sent us this episode.

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

This is episode 484 from April 24.

And this is an episode called pre-chowder.

This is familiar to me.

Because you're on it.

Oh!

Come on!

I'm fucking cleaning up.

Yeah.

The celebratory air horn.

That's right.

Wow.

So this is your sixth appearance on the countdown.

That's very, I'm very glad you're here.

It's crazy.

So we have Jason Manzukas.

And this is another one of his appearances.

He's himself.

Of course, people know him as Raffi from the league.

By what they shouted in constantly every day.

We have John Gabras as Geno.

Intern Geno.

He's returning to the countdown.

And he's playing as Geno character.

And we have you.

Do you remember what you played on this?

One of your all time classic characters.

KK.

And all time classic characters.

One of the ones you've been doing ever since the beginning of this show.

One of the very first you ever did.

Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Andrew Lloyd Webber is correct, sir.

Thank you.

I appreciate that.

I must admit I was unfamiliar with what happened in this episode.

Oh, I couldn't tell you.

I barely remembered what character.

So I listened to it a little bit today.

And I believe Andrew Lloyd Webber has an idea for a new musical.

And is that every time?

I believe it maybe every time.

But this, I was listening to this episode today and it really is like a, it's kind of like a pal-around episode.

It's very much like it's just four people enjoying each other's company for an hour and a half.

Which is a gift to the world.

It really, there's not even a ton of plot in it.

It just is us like riffing the entire time.

And I believe you came a little late.

So it's Gino and Jason and I for a minute of it.

But let's hear a selection of this episode pre-chowder with Andrew Lloyd Webber.

He has an idea for a new musical.

This is your episode five.

Number five.

Jason Manzukas, we all know from how did this get made?

And he plays Raffi or something.

That's true.

Do you play?

I play Ralfi on the...

Ralfi.

King Ralf.

I play King Ralf in the King Ralf prequel series.

Precom series.

What?

Nobody enjoyed that more than you.

Look at you, your face is red.

You are having a...

You're like...

I have to be honest.

I have to be honest with you.

I'm contorting my mouth a certain way because you may have noticed this thing on my lip.

My breakfast exploded in my face five days ago.

It said, the thing said, egg and bacon muffin.

Look just like a regular muffin.

I heated up in the microwave.

This is in your home?

This is in my home.

Okay.

I bite into it.

I hear a loud pop.

Oh no.

It explodes on my face, burning my face.

Really?

Yes.

I didn't even notice.

Okay. So in any case, my words are coming out a little bit differently because it's on the tail end of being healed.

Wow.

Look at...

Check it out.

Do you see it?

I don't want Kevin to creep in here and take any pictures of this.

Okay.

By the way, I know what he's in do.

Anyways...

Creepy mouth wound.

Creepy mouth wound tumblers.

Wow.

Can we take that whole breakfast thing again real quick?

Do you know...

Is it not rowing?

I'm not positive.

I was just unplugging, plugging in some stuff over here.

I hope not positive.

Wow.

Oh, I'm positive for three things, but not the big ones.

Don't worry.

None of the ones are starting with H.

Oh, okay.

Do you know, welcome.

Do you know Lombardo?

Yes.

That is correct.

It's Genovani, I believe it's Genovani.

Yes.

Genovani is short for Genovani.

Genovani, yeah.

That's what they cut it at Ellis Island.

From...

Did you go through Ellis Island?

Yeah, on a field trip in fourth grade.

And they changed Genovani.

They were like, I'm my high, I'm Genovani.

They're like, it's Geno.

Welcome to America.

And they showed me down the entire flight of stairs in the torch.

Really?

Yeah.

That is quite a few steps.

Oh, it was a lot.

Wow.

You're back.

You're from Long Island, and you commute out here every year.

Yeah.

I'm just catching Jason up.

Oh, I'm familiar.

I, of course.

I know, Gina just from, you know, he's a round as an intern.

Yeah, sure.

Yeah.

Some episodes you are here and you're not even on Mike.

I know.

Well, I'm talking the whole time, but you don't let me sit at the table, which is fair.

A lot of people don't know that.

You're here a lot.

It's like how Reggie Watts used to sing the comedy bang bang theme song live.

Right.

And then you have to run out every time.

You're here a lot.

Yeah.

Oh, I'm here a lot.

I'm obviously, I'm working.

I'm not just a comedy bang bang intern.

I'm an eowulf intern.

Sure.

So I'm doing a lot of stuff.

I'm, yeah, you guys got me out on the corner of Sunset selling socks, selling who charted socks.

Cool up the lysocks.

And what do you do for Katie Couric?

Anything?

She doesn't need any help because I'm always in there and she just makes me do stuff like taking my shirt off and spinning around in a circle for her.

Interesting.

Yeah, kind of eyeball me and stuff.

I think she's into like skinny shoes.

She's into super, yeah, speaking of a tube, by the way, you look like you've been through.

Yeah, a lot of people call me Johnny pipe cleaners.

And I'm like, my name's Geno and they're like, it just works better if you say Johnny first.

I'm like, well, Geno pipe cleaners work.

And I was not going to do the Samantha argument.

I have a little bag of bagel guy.

Yeah, you're a big guy.

Yeah.

He's the guy.

Ronnie at Bageltown Cafe, this motherfucker is in your grill when you're trying to say scooped out with chicken salad.

He's like, scoop it out.

Come on, you weigh nothing.

I'm like, I don't need carbs.

I'm looking for protein.

You know, we don't have to get into it.

Are you paleo?

I'm going full paleo.

Yeah.

I eat honey exclusively out of beehives now and killing me.

It's like Winnie the Pooh style.

Yeah, my face is a lot of my face is pretty.

I'm pretty scrolling.

Yeah.

And then it's up over here.

Have you ever gotten stuck in like a hole like Winnie the Pooh did?

I'm trying to get some honey.

Stuck in a hole.

Wasn't he famously stuck in a honey pot?

Oh, was it a honey pot?

I forgot.

He was like, because there's not a lot of honey in holes.

I thought that he went into what I mean.

Come on.

You're looking.

Hang on.

You're checking all rogue holes for honey.

I'm like, I'm in there just playing a little game I like to call.

Find the honey.

I thought he got stuck in like he was trying to get a honey pot out of it.

I don't know.

Who cares?

I think that too.

Is that something I'm sure?

The guy gets stuck in everything.

He was dumb.

Yeah, he was dumb.

Where the poo was dumb?

You know, is that also why you're only wearing a top and no pants?

Yes, because I...

You're going full Winnie the Pooh.

I'm pretty sure a paleo means you live as Winnie the Pooh live.

Pooh Leo?

I'm going full Pooh Leo.

I am hanging around with a nine-year-old boy named Christopher.

I think that's...

A lot of weird looks.

I think that's appropriate.

And a donkey and a tiger.

I have such a long, thin dick that not a lot of people even see it.

Like, you know, it's almost like two-dimensional.

Yes, it's like fruit by the foot.

Okay.

Welcome back.

Okay, I am...

This is your fault.

You know who you started it.

You started it with pre-come.

You're talking to talking to...

I beg your indulged bisexual intern.

Yeah, I apologize greatly.

Are you still on Ashley Madison?

I am still on Ashley Madison.

You're not married.

What are you doing under?

Well, I'm looking to wreck homes.

Listen to just getting there and destroy some people's lives.

I have a very specific fetish where I like to be fucking someone and have them accidentally call me their partner's name.

It's very difficult to arrange.

Is this due to your home life growing up with your different dads?

Yeah, with all growing up with just a home in a broken home.

Well...

And your home is literally broken.

Yeah, it is.

It's like physically broken in half.

Lightning struck the middle and it opened up.

Now I live in a giant V where you have to leap across a chasm to get from my bedroom to the bedroom.

Chasm.

That's how you say it.

That's how you say it in Long Island.

Oh yeah, it's a chasm.

You can.

It's a chasm or a chasm.

And we have another guest on the show.

This is a unique opportunity.

I believe the two of you know each other, actually, Janus.

So you can continue to talk during this segment.

Okay, that's fine.

We know each other.

I won't talk because I'm an intern, but we'll see.

Right.

The aforementioned podcast musical, semicolon comedy.

Musical, semicolon theater.

Theater, sorry.

Although that's a good spin-off too.

Musical, semicolon comedy.

Stop giving them ideas that don't feature me.

Why?

How do you know this wouldn't feature you?

Oh, that's fair.

It could.

I don't know much about comedy.

Do you think Janus?

Sorry, I was directly into the microphone.

I thought I was going to it and I didn't.

Oh, there was a contagious.

Nice and serious, suppose.

Oh my god.

Oh boy.

He's sincerely apologizing.

Come some fucking sleigh.

He is the host of that podcast, which I just mentioned.

And that's what he's most famous for.

And nothing else.

And he had a birthday about a month ago as well.

He shares a birthday with Stephen Sondheim.

And the aforementioned Lin-Manuel Miranda was celebrating it on Twitter as well.

Oh, I got to check it out.

Yeah.

So please welcome Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Yeah.

Hello.

Scortric.

Yes.

Why did you have to mention Stephen Sondheim?

I just find it interesting.

You are both very accomplished in your certain field of work and you share a birthday.

Yes. One rightfully so accomplished.

The other accidentally.

Just because we share a birthday doesn't mean you have to bring it up at every loss return.

I'm so sorry, but I just wonder if there's anything about March 22, 322 that lends itself.

You mean 22-3?

Sorry.

Yes, of course.

Then lends itself to being good at the art of musical semicolon theater.

Well, let's see.

You have two examples of people who've gone into the theatrical arts.

One, very good.

One considered good by some.

So I would say the jury's still out there, but...

Which are you?

Which is which?

How dare you.

Which one's the Lord?

This is what I would say.

Hey, hey, hey, the Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber.

Please put away your sword.

I don't know.

Well, why do they give me the blossom thing?

Welcome back to the show, Lord Webber.

It's so great to see you.

They're yours, Godric.

It feels as if quite some time today.

It has been quite a while.

How long would you say?

And why haven't you asked me to be on the program?

And you know all that time.

I am so sorry.

Who has been here in my absence?

We've had so many that we've had a gentleman who's a rapper.

We've had...

Oh, this guy, big chunky bubbles keeps coming back.

You want to say enough?

Yeah.

Oh, I enjoy it.

You do?

Yes, of course.

Haven't you ever seen his act?

No, he just describes it.

He makes these...

There's no other way to describe it.

Big chunky bubbles.

Yes, we know.

He's called soup stews and chowders.

One wonders when he comes on the show why he doesn't actually make some of them.

He's never done that.

That sounds amazing.

He just described this.

It's a visual medium, boy.

Why would he...

Well, I have eyes.

Is that why I had to run out and buy all that chow to the other day?

No, I think that was a different reason.

Oh, okay.

That's the yo is his racist guy.

Just slam and chatter at his bird spot guest.

Because what's better on a hot day than some hot chowder?

Oh, yeah.

Hot, thick, clam chowder.

Nothing like nukin' a can of chowder and then hold me in a glove.

Comedy bang bang.

Brought to you by Precom and Chowder.

Oh, God.

You like that one, Andrew.

Whatever.

Pre-chowder.

Well, I got to be able to do the job of...

Clam come chowder.

Yeah, you were racing with the boys.

What if before you made some chowder...

It's a bit weird, bold.

There was just like a thinner layer of chowder who was Pre-chowder.

All right.

That's what that will do.

It's Pre-chowder and then you add the clams and then it becomes...

Don't get me wrong, there's clams in the Pre-chowder.

Yeah, you gotta get better.

If you eat the Pre-chowder and it has clams, be careful.

If you made a batch very soon before, there may be a little clam.

Oh, there's definitely still some clams in there.

So hello, Andrew.

You don't have more?

No, I don't have more.

You said?

Yeah.

No, I don't have more.

I don't have more.

I'm not going to stop talking about it.

No, we're done. We're done.

Lord, whoever we want.

Sometimes you have to fill the can up with piss to wash all the chowder out.

With piss.

Sometimes you need to fill the can up with piss.

If this is your first time listening...

Yeah.

Goodbye.

Welcome to the best episode of the show.

I'm going to check out this show.

I wonder what episode 499 is like.

Lord, whoever, what are you up to? What are you doing here?

Well, you know, it's a bit embarrassing.

I didn't realize that...

Now, what's that?

Quiet!

See?

I'm sorry.

You're in this mood.

Why?

You're in this mood where you're being bawdy with your young boyfriend.

Oh, you missed it.

He am often exploded in his face, so it altered his behavior.

We got Bukake by breakfast earlier in the week.

And it's now real, it's trying to really overcompensate.

Under no circumstances tell me this story.

This is what's going on with my lip here.

I don't see any...

You grimaced at me.

Like a sickly wolf.

That was legit a snarl, I believe.

It was a snarl!

It's a face...

When you do it, it's a face you otherwise never make.

Which is interesting to see someone make a face.

That face.

Otherwise never make.

That's true.

Who would ever make that face.

That's great.

What face have I never seen you make?

I don't know.

Let's see.

I've seen that one.

Damn it.

That was when you were trying to make a bunch of pancakes in time for the kids who were a...

The pancake festival?

The pancake festival you throw in your house.

Honestly...

I gotta get in the bed now.

That got shut down.

Yeah, I made a shut down.

Yeah, it was a real Christro Robbins.

Did you have a comedy tent going on?

Yes, I had a comedy tent.

It was poorly run.

But it was close to the music tent.

It was close to the music tent at least so that everything was nearly inaudible.

Yeah.

Which is what I want in my comedy.

I want to be outside, uncomfortable, hot, and not able to hear it.

Lord, wherever you ever do a music festival?

I've done several music festivals.

Which ones?

Let's see.

Kuchila.

Are there musical festivals?

Are there festivals where multiple musicals are going on on multiple stages all the time?

That would be amazing.

Like Hamilton is top build on Saturday.

But if you get there early enough, you can see Miss Saigon and then all the others.

I don't know any other.

All the others.

We did do one on the Isle of Wight.

And it was a very ambitious idea.

And the main problem was we had several stages set up with musicals happening concurrently.

Yeah.

Sure.

The noise was deafening.

I would assume so.

You could not.

It was unpleasant to attend any singular performance.

And there was so much noise, it killed all the birds.

No.

Yes.

Was this during something like stop?

Was stop there?

Of course.

Stop was that.

Was Blooming Group there?

Blue man group was there?

Bringing Danois.

What about Defunk?

Oh, Defunk was there.

Okay.

Both with that.

A musical theater festival.

That's a lot of massage circles.

Feel like that show, if it were just like bringing both Danois and Defunk, it would be a better time.

Well, you can't have them brought in at the same time, dear boy.

Really?

You must bring them in one at a time.

Ah, separately.

Oh, yeah.

They can't be together.

I see.

It's a, if you've never seen the show in the first act, they bring in Danois and then they take an intermission and they say, By the way, come back.

Come back because we're bringing in Defunk.

Danois was remain.

They, they, in the old, when the show first opened, Danois had to vacate the building.

Wow.

The floor, Danois brought in.

Really?

Yes.

Dude, it was zoning or?

Danois.

I had read, there's a book, there's a great book about this.

I had read that Danois thought that he was the star of the show.

When, when he found out that Defunk was coming in after him.

Was the headliner.

He was not at it.

Danois was told that the name of the program was Bring in Danois.

Yeah.

Full stop.

Correct.

And it wasn't until he saw a poster on the subway that he realized he'd been duped.

Ah, and the person said, you didn't let me finish.

That's exactly right.

Yum.

That's exactly right.

Bring in Danois, semicolon, bring in Defunk.

What was this festival called, Lord Weber?

It seems so interesting.

I mean, it, it's, it's a festival like that.

I would love to go to it.

It was cold.

On the, it was, you said it was an island white.

Isle of light.

It was cold.

Yes.

I get emotional when I think about it.

Oh, of course.

Okay, you got it.

You're good.

I can see you recollecting.

It was such a wonderful idea.

It was your, it was your idea as well.

It was not my idea.

It was the idea of it.

It was the idea of every one of us who composed musical theater and we all banded together.

The first time.

Yes, he was there, of course.

Steven Sandheim, Candid, and Eb, Rogers and Have a Sound.

Every surviving person at that time.

And, and if they had not survived to that point, their robot doubles were there.

They're moving over.

So you've got like a, whatever paradox.

This was, this was a 1975.

I, George and I, Regur Schwain.

That's correct.

Jerome Kern.

Irving Berlinbot was there.

Did you guys do moving out the Billy Joel and Chuck Bucks?

This, this, this predated that.

Also, there were no Juking Box musicals present.

You don't like those.

Oh, I just do not.

Oh my heavens.

You can't, you cannot just cawing cawing cawing together.

Cawing cawing together.

Like a common cawblazer.

I said this on the record.

Which record?

The record where I give my thoughts and feelings.

Haven't you purchased that album?

No, I just called the intro line.

Is it a, is it a 45?

Is it a 45?

It's a, no, no, it's double album.

Double LP.

It's by the way.

By the way, by himself, I sit on, I sit on a chair on a stage alone.

Is it like three sides live?

Three sides live.

I just talk about whatever comes into my mind, my feelings on things.

By the way, you should do this.

We should sell.

You should do a double album.

I'm saying otherwise.

You have to survive somewhere.

Sure.

I don't know if you should.

If I think three friends.

We really should put out a special edition of this.

180 gram vinyl.

Come on.

Just very high quality vinyl.

He's a cocaine.

You just give me that record.

I didn't realize you were a cocaine.

Yeah, man.

I'm super into cocaine.

Oh, wow.

Yeah, it's brand new in my life.

Oh, that's so crazy.

I just discovered it.

Just how are you fighting?

It's terrific.

I'm getting a lot.

It's wonderful.

Isn't it?

Wow.

I'm getting a lot done.

I've registered a whole bunch of new domain names.

Oh, that's smart.

That's a good money maker.

Take us through at least 15 of them.

Okay.

Scott O'Kerman is a piece of shit.

Oh, no, I don't like that.

You can get Scott O'Kerman is a piece of shit.Ninja now.

Really?

Yes.

Is that ninja a thing?

Dot ninja is a thing.

I heard that.

Reply all.

Oh my god, of course.

I think I also heard you do.

That's probably Chirgina.

So, Andrew Lloyd Webber, what was the name of this festival again?

The name of the festival.

Don't forget me.

Okay.

You're forgiven.

It was called A Perfect Evening Surrounded by Water.

Wow.

By the way, that sounds amazing.

That's a great festival.

It was an aspirational title of the calls.

That's what we thought it was going to be.

You thought it was going to be a perfect evening.

A perfect evening.

It's almost a vengeous stuff.

And then the birds.

So, every one of the shows started at the same time.

We've used two.

Are you sorry?

You mentioned Robert Durst.

It's a trigger for me.

Oh, I see.

I burp any time I hear.

I do apologize.

We've used two usages of the word jinx.

Yeah.

Oh, wow.

You jinxed yourself and a jinx.

And we heard a jinx.

You had like a plastic.

Please stop saying sorry, sorry, sorry.

God, I've never heard you belch bummer.

I never, it's never happened in public.

You did it, Chino.

They figured you out.

Killed them all, of course.

So, you thought it was going to be...

Are you guys still doing your jinx remake?

We are writing this.

Your shot for shot.

Refational.

Of that.

Taking the documentary and training it.

The unlucky documentary we call it.

That's really, I love that as a move.

Yeah.

Gus Van Zanska and the director, we think.

He's the shot for shot guy.

When you see Janosafat as the titular jinx.

Oh my.

So, why are you working on something that makes you belch this?

He's the jinx.

Because it's worth it.

I do it for the artistry.

Art must be challenging.

ALW, are you writing songs into this jinx?

Yes.

Oh my God.

I'm sorry.

This is the line that's been crossed?

Yes.

Why are you sweating him to stop?

We're having a great time.

I know.

Did you want to talk about pre-come again?

No, I'm enjoying.

I mean...

Do you want to talk about getting a hot load of egg on your face?

You turned this now into something that it was not.

We shouldn't accomplish...

You were blowing an egg sandwich until it exploded all over your face and burned you?

You shouldn't have told us anything about your personal life.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Next time, I'll just keep it close to the chest.

Number five.

Oh, yes.

A lot of burps.

Yeah.

Disgusting.

How are you able to do that on command?

Are you able to burp on command?

Yes, I don't know...

I command you to burp!

It works.

It's gross.

I've never been able to do it.

I...

You're not missing anything.

Well, it's a coveted...

It was a coveted skill on the playground in the schoolyard...

Absolutely.

That all my friends could do when I could never do it.

They'd be like, just swallow some air.

Never works.

Has never worked for me.

I can't cry on command as an actor.

I can't either.

Just an actor.

It's a terrible thing.

I would rub the irritating stuff on the eyes.

Still couldn't do it.

Do you remember...

I...

We may have talked about this before.

I don't know if we talked about it on air.

My interest is peaked.

But on Comedy Bank, we had the TV show.

One of the episodes I was on, there was another actor.

We were setting up some reaction to something that was happening.

And it was something emotional.

And this actor said, do you want me to cry?

Everyone said one.

Whoa!

Like sarcastically?

No, they were like, oh my god, this is going to be amazing.

Oh wow.

And then this actor just had the makeup person come over and do the stick.

Oh right!

And it was like, oh yeah, well, yeah, anybody could do that except for me.

Oh, so you're saying even with the men falls?

I put so much there.

The...

It was Onions episode.

I don't know if you recall that one.

The Gillian Jacobs, Jason Manzukas episode.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Flashbacks.

Yes, yes yes yes.

Stand over a coffin and cry and say, why, why?

And we tried everything and nothing was working.

It was terrible.

Yeah, you just couldn't get it done.

So you were getting just the stinging of your eyes with no tears?

Yeah, and they were all kind of red, but no tears were falling dead.

They were like, that thing where you put it in to the eye and then it drips down.

Yeah.

That would work, but then they would put it in and then they go, okay, let's roll camera and then by the time, so I would say, hey, do it the last thing, like roll already.

Exactly.

You know what?

That's very basic.

The one time I've seen an actor cry on command is Charlize Theron when we did it between two fernswither and we had this gag where Zach was going to do an advertisement in the middle of it and we were trying to figure out like, what's the most inopportune time to interrupt her and do an advertisement?

And we were saying, oh, could you like cry about something?

And she's like, yeah, I guess I could tell a fake story and just like cry at the end of it.

We're like, really?

Could you?

And she tells the story and it's in the episode.

You can watch.

She tells the story about, I think, a dead pet and then she just bursts into tears and they're coming down and I'm like, oh, I guess she thought of a real thing or whatever.

We call cut and we go, oh, wow, was that a real story?

She goes, no, I just made all that up.

I was amazed.

She sounds like a sociopath.

That's what I'm saying.

To be a good actor, you have to have problems, I think.

Well, let me tell you this.

Just be quiet.

Okay, we'll do.

Years ago, I had an audition for a James L. Brooks movie and I never got it.

Oh, whatever works.

No, what was it?

I can't remember what it was.

Whatever works is Larry David.

It was one with Paul.

Paul.

How do you know?

You know.

His swan.

How do you know?

James L. Brooks's swan song.

That was his last movie.

I believe it was.

And he's never doing one again?

I don't think he is.

Do you think he's not allowed to or is it?

I don't know what's going on with it.

I...

We have a mutual friend that you should talk to about this.

Well, say, okay.

Someone...

I got this audition and it's a very emotional scene.

And so I remember at the time I was in a hotel room, I was doing a gig.

And so I'm going over the lines because I'm going to put myself on tape when I get back home.

It was the year that I was living in New York.

And so I'm doing it.

And as I'm doing it in the hotel room by myself, I'm crying.

Crying, right?

Yes.

And I was like, oh my God, this is great.

I never...

I can do this.

I never done this before.

Yeah.

So then I go to do it.

I'm going to tape it with my wife, Janie, is going to read the other lines.

And then a friend of ours was going to operate the camera.

And read a couple other miscellaneous lines.

And so as we're doing it, I am trying.

Yeah.

And it's not happening.

And meanwhile, Janie, off camera, she's crying.

Because the words are so beautiful.

She's like in it.

You know what I mean?

She's more in it to not even on camera for this.

Right.

And I was like, oh, okay.

Well, that's...

You know what it is?

Interesting.

I think I was talking about this in regards to Lauren Lapkes's and John Gabers' podcast raised by TV, where I had to do a Will Smith scene from Fresh Prince, where they do a very special episode.

Yeah.

That's a feature on their show.

And they gave me the scene, and I didn't read it.

I was like, oh, I'll just cold read this.

And then as I was reading it, I got so choked up.

And I started welling up because the words were...

I was accessing the emotions for the first time.

Right.

And then those guys were sort of like, Lauren was kind of getting misty and stuff.

And it was...

And I think the more you do something, the more you're just like, oh, yeah, these emotions.

I...

Where I was kind of like, I think I would be a great actor if you just put you put up cue cards, and I just was reading everything for the first time.

And then I could be in the scenes.

Right.

You know what I mean?

But do they do that for anyone?

Let's try it.

Let's do it.

Let's say that it works.

Put us in something.

Put us in something together.

Have the cue cards.

Look, can you fucking imagine?

There have to be like a whole generation of filmmakers and TV makers who listen to the show, who grew up learning what comedy is...

I don't know about that.

But from who have definitely listened to the show, just put us in something.

But imagine if like we get put in some big thing, we just get to see because somebody likes us.

And then there's real actors there.

And we demand...

Here's us...

Cue cards.

Thank you for putting us in this.

Now get us our goddamn cue cards.

We've never looked at the script.

Of course not.

I'm not going to read the script.

What am I playing?

Now I will say that was sort of like Reggie on Comedy Bang Bang never would never read the scripts.

And because he wanted to have those emotions really fresh, but to the point where you would have to like tell him what he had to say in the scene.

Like orally, inverably.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Here's what you say.

It's an interesting style.

It definitely...

But I am amazed at actors who can access that kind of thing take after take after take.

It's crazy to me.

All right, we're wrapping it up here, but I did want to play something at the end of this episode.

Oh yeah, you're playing special things.

Um, this...

This comes from an episode which did not make the countdown and was so close and was literally in the top 10 at certain points in the voting.

Wow.

And at the...

Just by the end of the voting, there was such a rush for voting for episodes that did make the countdown.

It just slipped down further and further.

So now it's not in the countdown anymore.

But this is from episode 515, and we're playing songs here at the end.

And so I wanted to play something from an episode which did not make the countdown.

This is Return to Suicide House Part 666.

And I don't believe...

I was very excited when I saw it was doing so well on the countdown for so long, because I don't believe any of the Halloween episodes have ever made the top.

Is that true?

I don't think so.

Some people should check on those stats for me, but I don't believe it ever has.

And so I don't think that we've maybe never played this song on The Best Ups before, so I wanted to play it.

But let me set up...

It's the song I think it is.

Oh yeah!

Of course!

So let me break down the scene.

So Nick Weiger, whom people would know from the Dough Boys.

Dough Boys.

Do you have Dough Boys?

I guess I've never really...

I've just ran a series.

I've only ever seen your print.

I thought it was Dough Boys.

I guess it might be Dough Boys.

Okay, you're right.

So people know him from the Dough Boys podcast, and he worked on Bang Bang for a number of years.

I believe he worked on the third season.

And then got a different job for the fourth, maybe, came back for the fifth, something like that.

So he's around a lot.

He was working on something with me this year, this last year.

So really funny guy.

And I knew he did this thing, this song, that's a parody of the Monster Mash.

Yes.

I think I knew it.

And so I asked him to be on the Halloween episode.

Like the first...

There's video of it.

Okay, so...

It's a produced music video.

It's something he's been doing for a number of years.

And so whenever we had this first Halloween episode that we did seven years ago or something, I asked him to do this song.

And it's basically become a tradition every year, much like Letterman's...

Jay Thomas.

Jay Thomas, who...

R.I.P. by the way, this year.

Oh, yeah, that's right.

He passed away this year when he would tell the story about The Lone Ranger.

It's something that I look forward to every year, mainly because I enjoy him doing it, but I also enjoy hearing the contortions he goes through to try to make it fresh.

Even though he's going to do the exact same thing.

Yeah.

So the just...

The character's machinations of tricking me into listening to it every year is always really fun.

So...

And I get to play PISS that he is doing it again this year.

This is a parody of the Monster Mash, a song called The Monster Fuck.

And basically what happens is he did it the first year and then every year tricks me into saying it's a different song.

After you...

I say...

We make real him...

...to a lengthy degree.

You're absolutely positive you're not going to do the same thing.

You're not going to do it.

And we go...

And he apologizes every year saying that he knows...

He tricked me the other years, but he's penitent.

And so this year...

And it's by the way, also Caroline Anderson, I mentioned her on a previous episode.

She was the writer's assistant on Bang Bang.

The first year that he did it on Bang Bang, I think he brought her and Eva Anderson, who was another writer on the show, to sing backups.

And Caroline has just come back every year to do it.

So this is the latest version of it.

It's People Love Hearing It Every Year.

This is the latest iteration of The Monster Fuck.

I'm very excited.

This is the world premiere of Scary Love by Scaryline.

Is that your stage name as well?

Okay, Scaryline, just Scaryline, like Madonna or Cher.

Just Scaryline, yes.

Okay, fantastic.

So Scaryline with Spooky Love, this is exciting.

Let's hear it.

Here we go.

Comedy Fang Fang World Premiere.

Scaryline.

Scary Love.

Featuring Leo Carpazzi, I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight for my monster from his slab began to rise and suddenly, to my surprise, his trousers dropped right to the floor.

With his bottom bare, he ran to the door.

I said Frankenstein, what's gotten into you?

He said my dick is hard and I need to screw.

He did the fuck?

He did the monster fuck.

Come on, monster fuck.

It was a graveyard fuck.

He did the fuck?

That monster sucked and fucked.

He did the fuck?

He did the monster fuck part six.

Very low.

For my laboratory, I heard quite the ragged.

Deep in the castle, the vampires jacked it.

The zombies all fucked in the graveyard grass.

Wolf man wolf down, Frankenstein's ass.

They did the fuck?

They did the monster fuck.

The monster fuck?

It was a graveyard fuck.

The beast all fucked as the orgy spread.

Bigfoot gave the headless horseman head.

Swamp thing jerked up in the castle moat.

Well Frankenstein gagged from the jizz in his throat.

The fucking was wet, there was spooch like mad.

Igor decided to fuck his own dad.

The mummy let out.

The horny moan, windman juices bear tits turned his dick to stone.

They did the fuck?

They did the monster fuck.

The monster fuck?

It was a graveyard fuck.

Those monsters sucked and fucked.

They did the fuck?

They did the monster fuck.

And Frankenstein's bride was horny as hell.

The hunchback went bare back and rang her bell.

She got titty fucked by a giant spider.

She's made the streaks in her hair much wider.

She fucked every monster come one come all.

Her three holes were filled like a bowling ball.

And while skeletons boned his undead bride, Frankenstein just jacked off and cried.

How do you shit fuck?

It's now the monster fuck.

And it's a graveyard fuck.

Those monster fuck and they fuck.

Now you can monster fuck part six.

Oh these monsters are depraved.

They're fucking and sucking with no regard for the world around them.

Christ has abandoned this place as these monsters fucking fuck.

Whoa.

Scary line great job you crushed it.

I'm so proud of you.

Grandpa be so proud.

You'd be good.

Okay.

Ah there it is huh?

There it is.

Always a good time.

Thanks to Nick Weiger.
