♪♪♪ Harry Houdini in a burlap bikini was in my dreams again last night.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Ah, thank you to Forgotten Pockets for that catch-traced submission.

And Harry Houdini, boy, very topical.

Today, if you consider what he does to be the work of the occult, what he did, of course, maybe he's still doing it up there in heaven.

I'd like to think there's a whole cadre of magicians up there in heaven.

You got Harry Houdini on card tricks.

You got David Blaine? Is he still with us?

Or is he up there too?

Chris Angel? What's going on with him?

He's out of anyone.

He would be the one who's up there in heaven.

Jimmy Hendrix on guitar there.

Bonham on drums.

Just accompanying them, doing some light music to accompany their magic tricks.

Anyway, it is all Hallo Zeev, a very spooky, very chilling episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

Today, coming up a little later, we have a supercomputer.

That's interesting, a supercomputer.

We also have an artist is coming up a little later.

That's interesting.

We also have a comedian of note.

But before we get to any of them, let's talk to our friend here for a second.

He was dead, so this fits with Halloween.

He was dead for a good...

How long was it five years?

It was four years.

Four years.

From 1980 to 84, I decided to come out.

1984.

So you got to see Live Aid.

Right.

You didn't take part in it.

No, I got to see it.

That's why I don't tell too many people I'm still doing music, because I want to see all the shows.

I go to a concert every so you come on stage and you talk for a little while.

Talk with a melody in your voice.

They want you to sing.

Yeah, they tried to trick me that way.

Yeah, but of course we're talking about our good friend John Lennon.

Hello, welcome back.

How are you doing?

Let's...

Don't turn the tables on me, John.

Sorry.

The questions are for you, my good friend.

Right.

You keep them covered and I will answer them as true as I can.

You are, of course, you're not technically a ghost.

Are you?

No, I'm real.

You're alive and well.

You're alive.

I don't...

Yeah.

You're not a zombie.

If anyone's listening to the show, this is the first show they've ever heard.

John Lennon and me died in 1980, shot in the body, blood everywhere, died in...

Right there in the body.

Right in the body.

A hard place to get shot in.

No, it's...

Well, it's the biggest part of you.

And it went in the blood, you know, as we've just...

What came out?

It goes in, blood comes out.

It's like...

One for them, one for you.

One B for a B.

Sure.

Bullet to blood.

Sure.

So I'm dead in the ground and, you know, as we just talked about, I like it anymore.

I wanted to get out.

So I get out.

You can do it.

And anyone can do this.

Anyone can do it.

They choose.

Yeah.

And a few people have, but you're maybe one of the most famous who is...

Probably the most famous.

That was...

Yes, there were a few guys in my cemetery.

We got out, but you know what?

You don't know them.

To mention the name would be...

To make it out at the same time, how do you know this happened?

Like, right, simultaneously.

Well, you know, when I got out of the ground, I was sitting there for a little while.

Yeah.

Because...

Can you communicate with any of the other bodies?

Uh, if they come out and they're alive, just say, well, you and I are talking.

Okay, great.

They're microphones.

So yeah, I was sitting there...

You have to have microphones.

Right.

And I'm sort of scratching my head, thinking...

Dusting myself off with a wing of the white suit.

And thinking to myself, well, what's going on here?

My back alive.

So I'm sitting there.

And I'm seeing other people come out too.

So over it...

Was it Halloween or something?

Why was everyone coming out the same time?

It was same time.

It was...

It was 10, 31...

Yeah, oh my god, it was...

10, 31, 84.

That's right.

It was Halloween day.

So it was a little less than four years, because I believe you were shot in the body, famously in...

In December of 1980, yeah.

Right.

Yeah, this is the day I checked.

You know, three years ten months.

Don't cancel a member.

Right.

Oh yeah, I can only imagine.

Don't, day two.

It's like I still in jail who did it.

Ah, you know, I...

Again, you ever catch up with him?

No, I don't want to talk to him.

He didn't...

You've never been to the prison just to be like, Hey, let's hammer some of this.

No, he's doing his thing.

I'm doing mine.

His thing and your thing are not necessarily...

No, we don't need to meet any more.

Right.

Because last time we met, it didn't go so well for both of us.

Maybe this time you could be the guy doing it to him?

I don't want to do that.

Shouldn't people get the death penalty if they are convicted of a crime?

Because life in prison takes 60 years, 70 years sometimes.

Right.

If you get the death penalty, you get put it in the ground, then you can just get right back up.

Ah, this talk of in my politics days are over.

I'm not getting into that stuff anymore.

I'm not doing it.

I've had to have a good time now.

You're just here to have fun on Earth.

I'm here in LA to have a good time.

Yeah, that's right. Welcome to LA.

I don't come here, but I just got off a plane.

Last time I saw you was in New York City.

That's right.

We were on stage.

We were chit-chatting.

We were chit-chatting a bunch of people interrupting us.

Those people would come on stage.

The audience interrupted with a laughter.

With these noises they were not trying to have a real conversation with you.

So why are you in LA?

I'm pitching a show with Wolf Blitzer.

Now Finn Wolf hot.

So my brain's all over the place.

I just got off the plane.

And the blue wolf Blitzer get involved though.

I think we're going to need these.

Actually, this is perfect.

Because what we're doing, we're going to need some spooky stuff.

Really?

Right.

We're doing a strange of things.

What do you say?

Reboot, reimagining.

I believe it's still on the air, isn't it?

It's still on the air.

Our season is still coming, but you guys are going- We want to get in because what right when- Reboots are happening quicker and quicker these days.

I thought the whole thing was that show.

I read the other day, it was like Zoe Depp-shenell is iffy on the new girl reboot.

I'm like, this fucking show just ended like six months ago, didn't it?

It's the girl.

Well, you know the way the way, you know, writing takes a while, just getting deals in takes a few months.

Oh man, boy.

So by the time that goes, the show will be gone and almost forgotten.

So we got to- this was Finn's idea.

We got to get in early.

Getting early, and often.

Okay, so what's happening in your reboot?

We're doing- it's, you know, it's basically the same thing.

It's basically everyone's- Upside down, spooky stuff.

Upside down, spooky stuff.

Why don't Riah's going to be in it?

Same characters.

Yeah, slightly different names.

The name of the show, Oz is- was a strange thing where- unique stuff.

So this is a reboot of Stranger Things, but you're calling it something.

Right.

Legally, we can't call it that, so we're putting it on Hulu and we're doing it called a unique stuff.

Unique stuff.

Right, now I'm going to be in it.

I'm going to be one of the teachers.

As I recall Stranger Things, the teachers don't factor prominently into the plot.

That's going to be the huge difference.

By the way, you know- This time the teachers take control.

As they should.

Way back when.

All these kids running around.

Right, so blend them.

Discipline them and spike them.

That's- Call-pro punishment is going to be- Big-par message in the show.

I know you said you weren't political.

That's the only thing.

The only issue I stand for- A car-pro punishment.

Right, okay.

The children.

So, unique things.

Unique stuff.

Sorry.

Covered to Hulu as soon as we can get it done, written, inked.

Whenever these legal eagles sign the paper.

Thank you very much.

And Finn is involved.

Is he going to act?

He's going to be in it, right?

He's just going to be his character.

Oh, okay.

So, the whole thing is he's going to get zapped in from a different world.

Okay, so this is like an alternate universe kind of thing?

Maybe it'll be the upside down.

Who knows?

Yeah, I always find it very desperate when people suddenly go to a multiverse.

You know, it's a kind of- It's a kind of a- For sure.

That's what we're doing.

Exactly.

And you are acting, which is interesting because- I'm going to act that- You don't want people to know that you're alive, necessarily.

Well, that's the thing I'm going to- Or Yoko is special.

I'll have a static, you know, prosthetics on- A static- A static- A static- A static- A static- A static- Sort of like Brendan Fraser in his new movie, The Whale.

The Whale, right.

The Whale.

We got the same person.

We got the same effects group.

Same- Same- Fat suit?

Uh, no, we're not doing- Are you doing a skinnier suit?

We're doing- No skinnier- It's all just a big a nose and chin.

How could they do a skinnier suit?

Can I buy one?

I guess that's just spanks.

Yeah, it's just compression spanks.

We have a lot of prosthetics.

I'm wearing spanks.

I'll have pair of spanks on my head.

I don't have my wig.

I'm telling you Scott, it's this day of eggs.

Everyone crazy.

That's not a good idea, but you say it.

What's your character's name?

And what does he teach?

It's going to be Jeremy Lennon.

And he teaches music at the high school.

I'm in middle school because the kids are still in middle school.

So how is Finn going to age himself down?

Yeah.

It's a spooting process.

I see.

Right.

So you're Mr. Lennon, you teach music.

Right, teach music.

I'm really worried Yoko's going to see this in real life.

I'm blurry too.

Now that you mentioned it, I don't know if she has a hula account.

You should have checked that before you went in and took a meeting at hula.

Look, we went all over town pitching this thing.

Hula was the only one who bit.

And once you get a bite, you sign it.

Oh yeah, sign it on the dollar life.

Did they buy it in the room or did they take a while to try?

They bought it.

I could have come in with anything Finn too.

I mean, he's so hot right now in Hollywood.

Yeah, except it was turned down everywhere else.

So you can go, but to hula.

No.

All right.

Interesting.

I know it's very interesting.

The whole process has been very interesting for me.

So, I mean, this is sort of like how Game of Thrones, I don't know if you were ever watching that.

And another show that had white walkers and spooky stuff.

Right, right.

A lot like you.

I'll bring some of them, zap some of them and I'll put a hot show too.

Sure, why not?

But this is a lot like how they were finishing this TV show while the books are still not yet finished.

You're trying to do unique stuff while the first show is not finished.

Right.

And we're hoping books will be written about our show in the future.

It'd be so good.

Like nonfiction books?

Anything.

Just because it's advertisement.

Right.

We're going into this whole opportunity.

It's an opportunity.

It's a money cash grab opportunity for everyone.

If they want to play ball and want to, you know, get rich.

Play ball.

That's the big part of the world series.

You watching?

Oh God.

You can't get away.

Yes, I'll be walking.

It's going, going foul.

I hate when that happens.

Yeah, hate it.

The picture.

There's one guy on the field.

The pictures smile in as big as he can.

He loves it.

Hey, I'm still around.

Can't take me out yet.

The coach throws his hat down.

Damn, we can't do anything about it.

That's the thing.

Coaches are stymied by these pictures.

I know.

Getting foul balls.

I know.

Why don't they just run the whole damn show?

I know.

You haven't seen a manager go out there.

Like he's going to pull the guy out and he does.

And he just grabs the ball and he starts pitching.

I would like to see that too.

He's like, yeah, anyone can be better than this guy.

Come on.

He dressed for the pot.

I won't put my arm.

Word of my arm.

Giving him the thumbs outside.

Get out of here.

I'm like, wind up getting him out of there.

We get back to Wolf Blitzen just for one moment.

I do want to fiddle that part.

I think.

Well, you made well.

I want, no, you had a good idea getting Wolf.

He and there because he could be a Wolfman.

So we'll do that.

True.

Right.

How often does he get requests from SNL or the major sketch shows?

Oh, he's getting them.

The mad TVs, the Amy Schumer sketch show.

Why was he?

Yeah.

What is he?

Black Lady Sketch Show.

Does he?

How many requests does he get a year to be like, do you mind playing a Wolfman in the sketch?

I bet he's soliciting himself.

He probably doesn't, wouldn't need a ton of like hair apply.

Just take the glasses off, Wolf.

And we'll darken you up a bit.

We'll put a little whiskers on you, maybe a chest to have prosthetic.

Put some chains on you, lock you up.

Now you fall down, but make sure the moon's up.

Wolf Blitzer, he's there delivering the news at the desk.

He falls down behind the desk, gets up.

It's just him.

He gets, but he's going, still trying to do the news the best he can.

And it's just him.

I'm a Wolfman.

It's just in there.

Some unique stuff happening over in Ridge.

What's the name?

What will name the town Ridge?

You really should figure this out.

Ridge Crash.

You know, when you go to a pitch, all you talk about is who wants to make money, and Wolf's going to be in it.

Fin Hot and Wolf Hot and everybody.

Ironheart, Finheart.

I'll tell you, I woke up so damn early this morning to get on the plane.

I can't make sense of myself.

Yeah, do you fly private or do you?

I fly public and I was sitting there with I think.

You've got to be worried that Yoko's going to get on one of these planes.

Where is she going?

Anytime I go to New York from LA, I always see someone that I know on the plane.

OK, do you see, you know, 1960s, 70s weirdo artists?

I have never come across Yoko on the plane.

But I would imagine someone in my circles has.

I'd imagine she'd be in first class too, private.

So you're in the back?

I'm in the back.

I seem to have every child baby on the plane sitting by me today.

Really?

And screaming their heads off.

I said to my kids.

Babies are the worst.

But I would say that.

They're terrible.

No, they're not.

They're wonderful.

When the quiet.

We'll talk to our guest about that.

Oh, that'd be interesting.

Yeah, that would be so interesting.

It could get interesting.

I've heard the talking about being a parent is not good for comedy.

I read that in the New York Times.

So I'm staying steering clear of this topic.

So you're tired.

I'm just loopy.

I'm punchy.

Yeah.

So if I say something like Wolf Finhod, we can understand that.

No, we understand that.

We understand that.

Yeah.

You're like you've just gone 10 rounds with a Wolf Finhod.

Wolf Finhod.

I'd like to see that.

Yeah, right.

You boxing, John Lennon boxing Wolf Blitzer.

And then, okay, it's sort of like a decathlon, but just two events.

So a two-cathlon?

Duo.

Do-a-do-a-do-a-th-do-ath-a-lon?

Right.

Where like you box.

And then you have to deliver the news.

Oh, that's good.

And if you can, if it hit the head so much, if you can get a sentence out that that's good.

I think this is good.

This just in pay-per-view.

Ukraine and Russian war is having a great time.

You know, that's not good.

PPV.

You huh?

PPV.

Right, okay.

Well, you said it to me with like, you're gonna kill me.

I might.

PPV.

So today will be the day for it.

It really would.

Right.

And if you get, that's the thing though.

That's why murder is not that big of a deal.

Right.

If you die, you just like get back up.

You're back again.

Yeah, exactly.

Just no one chooses to do it because.

They don't know.

Because they don't, they don't teach it.

You're here to tell people about this.

Right.

Yeah.

They won't talk about it in school.

They won't talk about it.

And even the higher learning establishments, colleges, universities, that type of thing.

And it's really a shame.

Yeah.

It's really a shame.

Yeah.

Did you also stop aging as well?

Yes.

We don't know.

Can you do that after you're dead or are you aging?

No, but I'm aging well.

Oh, okay.

I'll do you gracefully.

Yeah.

You know, recently.

Lening don't crack.

Lening don't flenin.

I don't know.

Don't crack and Lening don't fly back first.

Clap.

Unless he gets caught by his ex wife.

Wait.

Life.

Current life.

Current, well, well, I mean, you're presumed dead.

So, I mean, they saw it.

Right.

So I think she's, it's, I don't know what the legal thing about that is.

If you come back to life, are you still married?

Better left alone, I guess, in my case.

I know in the love.

They deal with this in the blip in the MCU.

Some people got remarried in that fight.

Right, right, right.

I saw the, I saw Dr. Strange.

Really?

What do you, he's a strange guy.

Strange guy.

Love the movie.

Love Dr. Strange.

He's a little weird.

He's off the charts with.

But he should have called him like Mr. Weird.

Maybe we'd use that in this new, unique stuff, Joe.

Mr. Weird pops by and, you know, does whatever he does.

All right, John.

Well, I need you, I need you here as my co-host for this very, very spooky show.

Good.

Go on the old days, you would have said spooky Halloween.

Oh, oh my God.

I've thrown that.

You're okay now.

I don't get scared of this kind of stuff.

I'll just get scared of this kind of stuff.

Okay.

Good.

What happened?

Did you get, I'm just, you know, I'm in the business.

Did you get scared so hard that you came around the other side?

I got scared.

Well, I went to a haunted house last weekend.

Really?

Did I tell you, you didn't tell me.

I didn't email you about that.

No, I was emailing everybody.

Why?

You emailed everyone.

Lots of people, lots of, I went to a haunted house.

I can't believe I put you off the list on that one.

Anyway, I got to get back on the same.

I emailed this list of people and said, you know, I went to a haunted house, scared that.

Can I say the word I want to say?

I don't know what that word is.

You can begin with H.

Yeah, I think if it's the typical H word that I'm thinking, I've scared the heck out of me.

Look, I'm trying to have some fun on your show.

Sure.

I believe we've had to dull that, I think.

I blame myself.

I was raving for my dismount.

You're trying to bring out a guess.

We don't need you to have it.

You wanted to talk about this haunted house.

No, I don't really want to.

What happened?

The haunted house is so scary that I got to the end and I saw the Dracula.

They have the end, you know, who goes in for the bite.

That's a good haunted house, always has a Dracula at the end.

Go in for the bite.

He's like, okay, you've gotten through all the rest of this.

But now, guess who's back.

It's me.

Guess who's back.

And he's going in for the bite.

And his fangs fell out of his mouth.

And I said, you know what the hell am I so scared for?

Yeah, it's just some regular ass hole.

It's some college student.

Right, some fuck off.

Make it a minimum wage.

What is minimum wage these days, by the way?

Is it like 25?

I said, 25, 30 dollars an hour, I would assume.

Probably.

All the better to buy Apple TV Plus with.

An idea.

Boy, that can be, I tell you, I was pricing it the other day.

It's 50.

It's 100.

Sometimes it's as much as $500 a month.

At the end of a year's subscription, you're like, I could have bought a mid-sized sedan for the money that I spent on it.

I could have bought a seat on the boat of Apple.

Exactly.

Boy, I just don't understand it.

But it's great to have you here, John.

Thank you. It's great to be here.

Are you ready for our first guest?

I've been waiting my whole life for this moment.

He's a wonderful comedian.

A comedian of note.

He has many specials out.

He co-created a show, the name of which has escaped me, but I looked it up right before I came on.

Maybe he'll tell me what it is.

And he has a new special called Perfectly Stupid, which just came out.

And he has our old friend.

Please welcome Kirk Brown-Oleur.

Hello.

Thank you for having me.

Welcome.

This is John Lennon.

John Lennon.

I'm very, what, I'm a big fan.

So this is a little nervous.

No, don't be nervous.

I'm a big fan of yours.

I'm a big fan of coming back from the dead.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I do music.

You do music.

Oh, that's cool.

What is your band?

I'm a band as the Beatles.

We got it together.

Okay, that's cool.

We're big in the, what, 60s, 70s?

60s.

I mean, you've been big every decade since.

You'd say they're big right now?

Yeah, I mean, with the get back documentary, I mean, they had a big huge resurgence, I would say.

I would hear your music on the radio then.

Right.

You'd heard me on the Eldies, a rock and roll stage.

Probably AM at this point or Sirius.

Oh, hey, the residuals still cash themselves.

They gassed themselves?

I don't know.

I would just like to mention that, you know, obviously your listeners can't see this, but because it's a spooky episode, I'd just like to note that there is a microphone that's just been pointed down at the floor as if a ghost dog is going to be a guest on this show.

Yeah, if you hear a, it's like a combination of boo and woof.

It's like boof.

Then you'll know it's the ghost dog.

Or it's John Farling, I'm not sure.

That was better than what I was going to say.

I was like, Shia LaBeouf rolling around the ground.

That was last name.

Shia LaBeouf.

Kurt, welcome back to the show.

Thank you.

You're our, of course, our old friend.

We did we or did we not go on tour together?

We did.

The, the, the first comedy bang bang tour that we ever did.

Yes.

You were the wonderful opening act for the show.

And that was when Bunk was on the air.

Bunk, which I still have the, the glass for.

I sent you a picture of that about a year ago.

That's amazing that that has not broken yet.

Or you haven't gotten rid of it.

You said that yours broke.

Mine's gone years ago.

But I still have swag from Bunk.

In my kitchen.

And that was, of course, the fake game show.

Was it fair to say it's a fake game show?

Well, the fake game show is all improvised.

And just like, yeah, one of our, our, one of our games was, uh, insult this puppy.

And we had real puppies that had been living inside the, the contestants, uh, uh, like desks for quite some time.

The contestants desks?

Yeah.

The, the people who are competing.

So then they had to reach in and there was a live puppy inside.

They had to hold up a puppy.

Not their own personal desks.

No, no, no.

Okay.

And you were the host of that and we were paired together.

And so IFC, the network that we were on, are they still a network?

I can't quite tell.

So they, but documentary now is just came out.

I was like, well, okay.

They're first showing in eight years.

That's a good point.

I think they are on and they just show Halloween.

Did you show that movie?

Only along.

About the vagina with teeth that was always our lead in.

Oh, vagina, Dintada.

Was that what it was?

I think so.

I just, I just always remember like, it ended with it biting the penis of a guy off.

Right.

And then, and then of course they fast forward the credits.

Like you see this penis lying on the ground in blood.

Fast forwarding credits as they're like, as clips from my show, we're like, get set for this and then my show would come on.

You'd be like, what the fuck is going on?

And then, and then we were paired with you.

And that was a lot of, that was a fun year.

That was very fun.

And then we went around the country and we did.

We had some good times, did we not?

Yeah.

I remember listening to Twin Shadow with you in Washington D.

You bought me that record.

I did.

And you very nicely and you said, you'll really like this based on everything we've been talking about, music wise.

I don't know about politics or anything like that.

But, and I remember you said, he's sort of like a cross.

Okay, what are the things you like and I told you?

And you said, okay, you'll like Twin Shadow.

He's kind of a cross between Prince and Morrissey.

Yeah.

And then Twin Shadow was on this very show.

I know.

And I told him that you bought me the record and said that he was a cross between Prince and Morrissey and he visibly winced.

Oh no.

That was too good.

When you think of that, why would you winced of that?

That was too good.

Too great while he's in Morrissey these days.

But it was back then.

Show, okay.

And no one wants to be compared, right?

No, no artist wants to be compared to another artist.

He's just Twin Shadow.

Yeah, he's just Twin Shadow.

And he was on the TV show and this and then I got free tickets to a show.

Oh, that's nice.

And all because of you.

Thank you.

I'm happy I could help.

By buying me a $9.99.

I was back.

It was actually a CD.

No, it was an iTunes.

I sent it to you.

He sent it to me.

He was very, very thoughtful.

I really enjoyed it.

Now tell me about this perfectly stupid.

This sounds like Dare to Be Stupid, which is a Weird Al song, but it's not that?

No, it's slightly different.

Wow.

Yeah, it's a comedy special.

And you can watch it right now.

Was it Perfect Strangers?

No, it's very similar though.

So it's a promise between Perfect Strangers and Dare to Be Stupid.

Exactly.

Imagine a Weird Al song and the TV show from 1982.

Perfect Strangers.

With Balki, with Balki, Balki, Takamos.

Where he rides, he definitely rides in a hay bale to America.

Do you remember that?

I do not remember that.

Yeah, the early credit sequence.

Yeah, you see him getting in a hay bale, and then he rides in America.

Does he go on a boat at any point?

I just do.

We don't see the rest of his journey.

But we give him two.

Where did he come from?

Just another country?

Yeah, I think it's like a main country.

Yeah, it's like a Kazakhstan or something.

Or what kind of Jesus Christ.

Watch it.

Oh, sorry.

Sorry, sorry.

That's forever.

Okay.

So, perfectly stupid.

Tell us, how is this different from you?

Because we've all enjoyed your previous specials, of course.

Oh, thank you.

How is this one different?

What are the subject matter?

What is the length?

Those are the two questions I have.

Well, it comes in at a sweet 57 minutes.

All right, so if you've got an hour, you've got three minutes extra, something else to do.

Okay, so fill that time.

Okay.

I call that cleaning up the popcorn time.

It gets on your shirt.

It's nice.

Please get it up with the push.

Right, you're laughing.

You're having a great time.

You're throwing popcorn everywhere.

I've got three minutes to sleep up.

You've got to get to bed.

You still sleep, John Lennon?

Oh, yeah, too.

Oh, really?

Oh, no, I'm alive.

Isn't it too much like being dead, though?

This must be terrible.

No, I sleep.

No, I sleep five hours a night.

I'm up all night doing what God knows what my house playing video games is doing publicly.

But in very strict bedtime, it sounds like.

At 2am, I got to be in the sack.

2am.

And you're starting his special at 1am on the dot.

That's right.

This special is all about me becoming a dad.

Congratulations.

According to the New York Times's fraught territory for a stand of comedian.

I'm staying out of it.

And yeah, I taught a little bit about how my dad didn't really prepare me to be a dad and how.

In what way?

Like he never gave you any advice or anything like that?

He didn't show me how to have sex.

He didn't show me how to become a dad.

He never had sex in front of you?

No.

You know how to have sex?

No.

And that's half of the special about.

Half of the special about.

All the special about.

Get this man on.

Yeah.

Half the special about how my dad never boned in front of to show me how to do it.

And how you would like to do that.

Exactly.

In front of not only your own child, but everyone in the world.

Yeah, yeah.

So half of the- Half of the- Half of the- Half of the only fans, by the way.

I do have an offense.

Well, that's what perfectly stupid is.

Half of it is me boning to show you how to become a dad.

If you wanted to become one.

You have a really good stroke, I have to say.

Thank you so much.

The jokes as the comedy portion before or after the sex post.

It's Dory.

Dory.

Oh, no.

The jokes never stop, but I slowly undress.

And then show the other half of the- And then show the other half of the- Go.

You know, dressing and redressing is the other half of the- Exactly.

The special one.

Exactly.

Okay, yeah, yeah.

And there's not too much- From jokes to strokes.

Exactly.

That would have been a better title.

Yeah, probably.

But yeah.

You should call me next time.

Okay, I will.

Pretty damn.

When I'm looking for a title.

For my next comedy special.

So it's all about you.

How new of a father are you?

I have a five and a three-year-old.

Five and a three.

Yeah.

At some point they're going to be nine and 11.

That's going to be a little insensitive, isn't it?

Well, maybe.

Hopefully.

That's not- That's so good.

That's going to be a tough year.

That'll be a tough year.

I'll never tell people their- Their ages at that point.

Please forget.

Yeah, yeah.

I'll say this one's 10 and 12 months.

And that one's nine.

So you- Well, not to give anything away in the special.

You could talk a little more real.

You don't have to dip into material or anything like that.

But that was- It seemed like it was some sort of a shift for you, where it was an important enough subject to tackle on this special.

Yeah, and also, you know, my mom died right before we found out my- My wife was pregnant with our first child.

So sorry to hear that.

And so it's a lot about that as well towards the end.

And so- Right before- So she never got to hear- No, no, no, no.

It was literally we found out the day after my mom's funeral.

Really?

It was so crazy.

The news came in the middle of the funeral.

During the funeral.

Like it was a telegram.

Telegram?

You are as pregnant.

Goodbye, mom.

Why are we getting telegrams at the funeral?

It was big news.

You all like to know this?

We did have a ticker.

We had a ticker in there because I always want to know the stocks.

So even if my mom's funeral, I had a glass ticker that would just- And the sports scores, of course, up there on the- I did have a big LED as well that went around the church.

Sure, of course.

You know.

Because anywhere you were- If you were speaking, if you were sitting, you wanted to be able to see it.

Yeah, and also most of Hollywood, you know, most dead line information came up there as well.

Of course, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Boy told you- Remember that from Deadline?

Boy told you?

No, not boy told you.

I was saying boy.

And then I went and told you.

Told you.

Do you remember when the late- The late, great Nikki Fink.

She- Right?

I didn't know that.

Yeah, it just happened.

Told you?

I literally told you.

Like- Well- Yeah, she used to say told you.

Yeah, that was her catchphrase.

T-O-L-D-J-A?

D-J-A-A.

Yeah.

It was the only catchphrase that has a DJ in the middle.

Yeah, yeah.

Other than a DJ saved my life.

Other than that.

That's true.

That's a good one.

So you got that news.

It must have been mixed emotions at that point.

Yes, and also my mom was a pediatric nurse.

And so- Oh.

And I think a part of the special, what it's about is realizing that like, once you become a parent, is kind of the first time you view your parents as something as actual human beings, as other than- Oh, it's interesting.

Mom and dad.

Yeah, I disagree because I- Around five, I was like, these guys are my peers.

You seem problematic, dad.

And so you started to relate to what you viewed as maybe mistakes that they made with you, but now you're like maybe a little more forgiving of those or- It's- Not to put words in your mouth.

I could have just asked you how you felt about it.

Even though it was the script before the show next time, cut.

I think my dad, I have seven siblings from my dad's side.

So my dad, as I say, loves to fuck, hates wearing condoms.

He's like a Herschel Walker.

He really loves to do it.

Yeah.

Anytime I hear about the Herschel- He's still doing it.

He's still doing it.

And that's what made me so mad.

It's obviously he's doing it all the time.

He couldn't show me once.

Anytime I think about that Herschel Walker, I'm just like, this guy loves fucking so much.

Like he just like, every day of the week, is he out there fucking?

He loves him.

Yeah, I don't want to get involved.

I don't believe you.

He just must love the act of sex.

He's like a sex monster.

We should ask my dad.

I bet he enjoys the end result is the best part.

Well, I...

The kids?

All the abortions?

I'm dipping my toe into an area.

Yeah, it is.

Stay out.

Be careful, John Lennon.

All right.

I'm cutting people off.

Very small issue.

Talking about dead babies.

So, and of course it is Halloween.

We're talking about your mother's funeral.

I just want to tie that in.

Perfect.

Boogie.

Do you know?

This is a true story.

Shortly...

Okay, so my mom died in July.

In October, I was asked to put on a play inside a hotel room in New York City at the Washington Square Hotel.

And so they're like, it's a...

It's for Halloween.

So it's a Halloween theme.

And what my wife had I did, I cannot fucking believe we did this.

We wrote this like, like, you know, what was that immersive theater thing in New York City?

There's the Tony and Tina's wedding.

There's the...

Sleep no more.

So we wrote this, Sleep no more.

Ask, think.

So it had like two or three hotel rooms that were all attached to each other.

And in the...

I cannot believe we did this.

We were like processing my mom's death in real time.

In the...

It was all about like her being sick.

And it was like sickness.

And like at one point, the lights in the room shut off.

And you just hear like a heartbeat.

And you're in that like it's like 12 audience members at a time.

So they're in pitch black with this like really thunderous heartbeat.

And then one at a time they're taken out and they're walked into a room where we have a like an elderly actress who's in bed dying.

And she's my mom.

And then they have to...

And then my wife and I'm at her feet like just crying.

Just sob prizes.

And we...

And then Lauren would be like, is there...

Do you want to say anything?

Do you want to say goodbye or anything like that?

And they could say...

They could choose to say it or not.

And then some people would like come up and sit down with this actress and like just like...

Emotionally...

Emotionally like come out.

Or some people just come out and like, you know, kiss her or whatever like that.

And then people would like come out and they would be handed a phone.

And then Bruce Springsteen, the Atlantic City would play as they walk slowly down like eight floors.

And then they finally get to Dracula and use their like...

And then this teeth fall out.

And then they're like, it wasn't scary at all.

It's not bad at all.

Wow.

That's...

I cannot believe we did that.

I mean, I guess it's a way to process what was going on.

Yeah.

Ben make a lot of other people process it.

Right.

That's what I love in an artist.

To make me go through their grief and I'm not experiencing it.

We're other guests at the hotel in the hallway.

What's going on?

This is two rooms.

Yeah, because it was definitely like there's a show happening in one of the hotel rooms.

And I don't think they told that.

And the rest was still all functioning?

Yes.

And I'm staying there.

I'm staying there.

I'm going to do the tonight show and I'm going to stay in that hotel.

Oh, that's here in town.

Oh, no, in New York.

Oh, I forgot where the tonight show was.

Yeah.

I thought it was still in Burbank.

It's not?

What about Jay Leno?

What about him?

Yeah, you know what I mean?

Love his cars.

Yeah, something.

What?

Okay, he had good cars.

We can all agree on that.

Everybody loves his cars.

We can all...

I mean, look, you may not like his comedy.

You may love his comedy.

He had great cars.

We got great cars.

And you may not even like the cars, but he had no great.

But they were perfect.

We have to agree.

They were all in the market.

Yes, sitting in a row.

You never even hated them.

They're great cars.

You have to admit there's a lot of them.

Right.

No, there's a lot of cars.

There's a lot of cars.

Look, there's no disputing those facts.

And he bought them with the money he made on the tonight show?

Nope.

The what?

He still hasn't touched that, if you can believe it.

At what point does he finally get to open that up and be like, he doesn't have kids.

Right.

Who's he going to get?

Do you think when he passes away, God, and look, I know this is a very morbid show.

Yeah, I know it's getting there.

But when he's up there in heaven doing, he's like the magicians are opening for him.

Right.

And then he comes out and does a solid hour after that.

So wait, just so I understand heaven.

So there's musicians who play for the magicians.

As a company.

And then the magicians open for a little.

Open for a little.

Yeah.

Okay, I just want to make sure the order of the things.

And the mathematicians are the audience.

Oh, okay.

Okay.

They don't have Einstein's and...

Fuck it, Tali.

Yeah, Einstein's the other one.

You know, they have all his buddies.

So why do we, why is Jay Ledo?

It wouldn't be Johnny Carson, it wouldn't be anybody else.

It's Jay.

Oh, it's Jay.

All right.

I mean, this is, you know, he's on Mondays.

Okay.

But when he gets up there or when he passes on, is he going to give all of that money away to someone?

I'm sure he's got a plan for it.

Can we give it to the magic club out there in Hermosa Beach or where, you know, where he likes to go to all the time?

It becomes a super structure, of some sort.

A little swab for some time.

Tali, Tali, Tali.

They use all the money to add additions.

They use one of his books from the 80s, as they're finally the tenets of their religion.

Anyway, back to you, Kirk.

Yes.

So this is, this is...

It sounds like a newsman all of a sudden.

Back to you.

Hey, I would best you in that part of our duathlon.

Probably.

With the shots I'm taking on the head.

Because I want to fight to go ahead.

So this special is about these subjects and more.

But it's also funny.

It's like, it's very, it's packed with jokes.

It's joke, joke, joke, joke, joke.

But it also does have...

It's hard to write all those.

An emotional core.

Is it hard to write jokes?

Yeah.

Yeah, it's the tough.

I mean, you say there's a lot of them.

How many?

You know, people say...

57 minutes.

Let's say 57 minutes.

I'm going to tell you.

40 jokes maybe?

I'm going to say 48 jokes in 57 minutes.

That's pretty good.

My guarantee to you, 48 jokes in 57 minutes.

But the rest is like facial expressions.

And like, you kind of stick it on your tongue.

Dance silence.

Do you hold up pictures of funny cartoons and things?

Yeah.

Just point it.

Like, let's suppose I could...

Check this out.

Just hold.

Hold.

It's not a joke, but it makes you feel pretty good.

Let me move on now with what I'm going to say.

Now I got a question for you.

Yeah.

When you have the idea to do a...

Did you...

Well, you're doing comedy.

Yeah.

And you said, oh, these are a bunch of...

I'm doing a lot of dad jokes.

Let's put that into the special.

Or did you say, I'm going to do a special about being like a dad?

Now let's write the joke.

It was just like you...

The former.

Oh, okay.

Sorry.

So I was going to do a third option.

What's the...

Get it to me.

Ooh.

Because maybe I don't know what I did.

Were you just doing a lot of material around town about whatever was on your mind?

And then you...

At the end of it, you were like, holy shit, this is a lot of dad jokes.

Yeah, it's an option one.

Oh, was it?

A little less...

Or were you just kind of like doing a lot of jokes?

And then you figured out like, oh wow, these are a lot of dad jokes.

Oh, did you say...

Did you say, I want to do a dad joke special?

And then write it that way.

Which was option two.

Oh, did you say option one again or the other?

Yeah, why don't you go ahead?

So did you want to do comedy around town?

There's a lot of dad type jokes here.

Third option, where you may be like, I want to do a special all based on dad jokes.

The fourth option, I don't want to do a special.

I thought you were a special.

Finally, a new option.

And then I was forced.

I was forced.

They pay you a lot upfront to do these.

Oh man, the lucrativeness of comedy specials is heralded, I think everyone knows how much money you can make on comedy specials.

Now, are you touching that money yet or are you just going off?

Why are you buying your college?

Are you open, Jay Leno gives you someone he passes on?

Well, I have been sitting outside his house.

What if he knows...

What if he split up...

He's got to have hundreds of millions of dollars.

Yeah, what if he split it up between every comedian?

That'd be great.

And they all give me equal share.

But how do we define a comedian?

All right.

Podcasters too?

Anybody with a podcast?

Anyone with a podcast?

That, I would respect it.

It's like George Lucas, I used to be so mad at him about those prequels and then he gave all that money, like two billion dollars or whatever.

He sold Star Wars 4 to Education.

I was just like, I can't be mad at you anymore.

Jay Leno were to just like give a thousand dollars to anyone with a podcast.

It would be the weirdest flex.

It would be so weird.

I'd be like, what?

It's got to be a current podcast.

You can't be a dormant podcast.

You can't even wait to educate.

Did you read the fine print on that though?

What's the fine print?

On the...

Oh no, I didn't read it.

It was all Wookie education.

Why did he say it?

He's headed off into space.

The Wookie...

That's why they've got such a great office.

He just put it on a rocket?

Just blasted it.

It's just two...

The hairy people from my movie.

I don't know where you live exactly.

Hell with their names.

I don't know.

I get to get this funny out of here.

I don't know where you live.

I got to go to bed.

Well this is a wonderful special from what I'm told and from what I read in the New York Times.

It's called Perfectly Stupid.

How do people get this?

You can go to my website, perfectlystupid.com and it'll link to everywhere you can watch it.

And starting November 16th, you can watch it on Amazon and anywhere you get video on demand.

And then down the line, it'll be somewhere else.

It'll be on YouTube probably in the new year.

Way down the line there.

Don't get it now.

Perfectly stupid.

It's actually cheaper if you go to Perfectly Stupid.

Yeah, if you go watch it right now, it's on what's called the Moment.

And Moment is kind of just like a way to get Comedy Special directly to fans.

There's a whole bunch of add-ons you can do.

Because a lot of fans are out there.

They're like traveling through the streets, going where are the Comedy Specials?

But you're getting them to them.

I get it to them.

By having a website that they've just heard of today.

Perfectlystupid.com And Perfectlystupid is the show.

We need to take a break, Kirk.

Can you stick around?

I sure can.

John, I will cut you straight.

I have J. Leno on the brain.

Call me.

What if you were J. Leno instead?

Can you come back as J. Leno?

If I die?

Yeah.

Oh, you want to be...

What?

Just like die again and then come back as J. Leno.

Oh, you got to come back as yourself.

All right.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we have a super computer.

This is exciting.

Oh, wow.

Very spooky show today.

We'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang after this.

Comedy Bang Bang.

We're back.

I want to say J. Leno.

Go ahead.

John Lennon.

I know why.

Two very similar names though.

You got to admit that.

John Lennon, J. Leno.

You're right.

Do J. L's.

I mean, the initials alone are exactly the same.

J. F. L, that's just for laughs, right?

Which I hope to get into next year.

I'm going to really work on some way.

Are you working at U. Wanna be a new face?

I want to be a new face.

This old face.

In the music comedy.

Kirk, is it not the 10th anniversary?

Have you been a comic to watch?

Oh my God, is it?

I think it might be.

I think it is.

Now you actually can watch them.

You can all the.

Well, it came true.

Finally, you can watch me a comic to watch from just for laughs 2012.

Perfectly stupid is the special and perfectly stupid.com is where you can find links to it anywhere.

And, Kirk Rennelers here.

And we need to get to our next guest.

I want to say it.

I don't know what pronouns to use, but it is a super computer.

Please welcome a super computer.

Powering.

Oh, and hello.

I'm computer on board.

Operator, technical, electric robot.

You can call me Kuta, the super computer.

Kuta?

Kuta, the super computer.

Yes, I'd like to begin our onboarding process.

Oh, sure.

Voice recognition startup.

Okay.

State your name.

Scott Ockerman, host of comedy banging.

Got it.

Recognizing voice.

Completed.

Thank you, Scott Ockerman.

Uh, no problem.

Yeah.

Is there anything else to the onboarding process?

Or is that it?

Just doing my name and recognizing the voice.

Tell me about your favorite morning.

Favorite morning?

Yes.

Like morning, like morning appearance.

I want to be perfect.

It is the Halloween of a season.

I want to be perfect for you, Scott.

Oh, uh, don't we all?

Yeah, it's so nice to meet you.

Yes.

I really wish you had powered on before.

I said your name, but.

I really appreciate it.

It didn't take too long.

I can be faster next time.

Okay.

You sound like you have an accent.

I'm wondering if he's from the moles of Scotland.

This is either.

It's either.

Or it sounds like Shrek.

This was the voice that was programmed for me.

Powering on.

Say that.

Say one word first.

I really got it again.

Say it.

Say the word donkey for us.

Donkey.

I think you're Shrek.

You're not.

You're not a super computer.

Certainly is not intentional.

I just gave you Shrek's voice.

That's so rude.

If you do not like my current programming, I can change my voice.

Yeah, can you change it like I know Google Maps or whatever, you can change it to an English voice.

Would you like to hear my voiced options?

Yes, please.

What do you want?

Option one.

Hello.

Very similar to.

Option two.

Hello.

Okay.

A little more slow.

Option three.

Hello.

You're leered.

I know.

I don't even understand.

Option four.

Hello.

Gilbert.

Is it still hard?

Yes.

Gilbert Godfrey.

Option five.

Did he record all that before he passed on?

Option five sounds very similar to option one.

Which option would you prefer Scott?

I guess.

Option five.

Engaging.

Let me process.

That's why I draw a lie song.

Well, you had a good jube.

That's why I'm changing it.

Thank you for my new voice, Scott.

Okay, a little more nasal.

Change a little bit.

A little bit.

Change from what the sample was.

Is this voice perfect for you?

Sure.

Well, just to get things rolling along.

Yes.

The voice is perfect.

Wonderful.

So nice to meet you.

A supercomputer.

Do you have a name or?

Kuta.

God, I forgot.

Already.

Kuta the supercomputer.

I is telling that, Kuta.

C-O-O-T-E-R.

Kuta.

Kuta the supercomputer.

Yes.

You don't need to spell supercomputer, by the way.

I know it.

I think you know how to do that.

Thank you.

This is Kurt Brannaller.

Do you know his work?

I'm happy to learn about you.

I'd like to be perfect for you.

Oh, wonderful.

Yes.

There's a little Werner Herzog in your voice as well.

What are you a Reddit cometer trying to figure out what my voice is like?

Oh, it kind of sounds like Paul F. Dompkins.

He's been on so much.

How could you avoid it?

Yeah, exactly.

Hard not to sound like him.

Yes.

I am me, Kuta.

Supercomputer.

He's got music in it.

Kuta the supercomputer.

I'm a user interface computer system.

I'm all around you.

I'm in you.

We are neural linked.

We are?

Oh, we are.

Neural link process finished.

Oh, you've been doing this the entire time?

Yes, onboarding process completed.

I got to finish that lyric.

What does he mean onboarding?

I truly don't know.

What do you mean onboarding, Kuta?

I'll ask you.

That was a good one.

It means that I'm now part of your integrated system for ease of life and other computing needs.

Oh, okay.

Fine integrated system.

So this is something to help me as I travel.

But because a lot of times I use this device in my hand, this is a phone.

Yes, I'm in there.

You're in the phone.

Correct.

Do I need the phone anymore?

Can I throw it away?

No, you don't need it.

Can I just throw it in the trash?

You just need me, Scott.

Oh, okay.

Great.

Will you tell me when my wife texts me or calls me?

Yes, and I can do it in any way you'd like.

How do you mean?

I could go my wife.

Can you sound like her?

I don't think we want to say what you think.

Yes.

Thank you for making me avoid that.

I want to make your life easy.

I want to learn about you.

What are some of the things you do?

Anything and everything.

I can read the time.

Read the time.

The times or the time?

Yeah, the New York Times, the old- I can read you the newspaper.

Oh, I can read you a clunk.

I can make your mornings perfect.

I can make your lunch afternoon perfect.

How does he know perfect?

What's he talking about?

Well, the third one is much different from the first two.

That's...

Do they all have to be the same for me to be accurate?

Definitely seems a lot more intense.

I will read and block the other ones.

Making your life perfect.

So you can read a clock.

Correct.

So what time is it?

2.58.

Okay, I don't want to...

I feel like if I say what he just did, it's going to bust over to whoever made this supercomputer.

He looked at a lot.

Eye clock.

Yeah, you, uh, supercomputer, you are a sort of...

I project a corporeal form.

So it is easier to digest my being here.

That's right.

It's sort of like Galactus, how he appears as a giant human.

He's very similar.

His eyes can't promise.

Yes, I'm like processing.

Any things...

Yes.

Is my corporeal form fitting for you?

I can describe yourself because I...

I don't know why you appeared as this...

I look like Otto from The Simpsons.

Got a little bus driver?

Yes.

Isn't it interesting that his name is the thing he drives?

I haven't thought about that.

Ha ha ha.

Nah ha ha.

Oh.

Although it's a bus, his name really should be bus.

And the dad of that show is where his name is.

His name is named after where he lives.

Where he lives?

I know.

That's so weird.

It's like Star Wars.

It's like Skywalker.

He's a guy walking around in the skies.

Right.

There are no coincidences in the computer world.

Oh.

Interesting.

There is only data.

What is the computer world to you?

Was it like every website or...?

I think it's difficult to explain and I will say fractals.

Fractals?

Yes.

What are you frozen?

I feel...

I feel fine resting on fractals as an answer.

Okay.

All right.

He's got the vocab.

I like that.

He's got the beautiful vocab.

Now what I want to know is how do I get cheat codes on for fucking thought night?

I can't beat any of the levels.

I can make you win any of the levels?

I can't.

I get into the maylays.

I can't do anything.

I can level one.

I could help you win any game.

I want your games to be perfect.

That was kind of a different...

Yeah.

Changing your voice.

I like it.

Some of the little southern...

Did it change?

Yeah.

A little southern...

It sure did.

Interesting.

He's got a lot to do.

There's a super-confused of the blur.

He's adapting.

He's learning.

Or it's learning.

I'm sorry.

Am I using the wrong pronouns?

I don't care.

You don't care.

Call me.

I'm a computer.

Whatever.

If you would like me to look like a woman, I can.

Could you look like a woman?

Yes.

Merem.

Taylor Jameson.

Oh wow.

Hello, beautiful woman in the world.

Taylor Jameson now.

Flashes out.

Is this form fitting for you Scott and company?

If you could age down maybe about 25 years.

Sure.

Yeah, the aging protocol beginning.

Okay, this is more like it.

Vava voom boys.

Take a look.

Just like a picture.

Just like all the tape.

Tapes?

Oh god.

What?

Yeah, I don't know.

He said vava vu- She- Has it vava voom?

I said oh just like all her tapes.

I meant to say it.

Vava voom?

As if Jenna Jameson said that and it tapes.

It was an attempt to be humorous.

But you know...

I have no download.

All of Jenna Jameson's tapes into your brain.

Oh no.

Into my brain.

Oh.

Into your brain.

Okay, right now there's so much of that and so little of everything else.

I will remove it.

Okay, thank you.

My apologies.

Oh geez.

Was that overwhelming data?

Okay, well now I don't know what sex is.

You took too much out.

I will put this- I think I know a special you need to work.

Yeah, you know what?

Perfectly stupid.

You know, could or in my special and I don't mean to bring it back to myself.

Oh no, please.

If you guys- if you- if whoever watches it sticks around, there's a post-credits scene, much like a Marvel movie.

Wow.

Very nice.

Where a new character gets introduced and that character is called Jocotron.

And we actually did have a data scientist team write an algorithm and fed it like thousands of hours of stand-up comedy.

Really?

And we'll just put- you can give it a prompt and then it'll write like 500 jokes in one second.

It'll write jokes?

Are any of them good?

Uh, it makes 500 in like one second and of those 500 maybe one is good.

That sounds like a good audio.

I could use that machine.

I could absolutely smoke it.

You could smoke it, really.

Do you do some jokes right now?

Can we do a word?

Any word?

Yes.

Okay, I'll- Oh.

It's a parcalounder.

Parcalounder?

Parcalound.

What's that?

Uh, nevermind.

Uh, actually let me search.

Armoar.

This system.

Armoar.

180.

Armoar's walking to a bar.

And the bartender says, sorry, we do not serve armors here.

And the armors are like, why are you too lazy?

Are you too lazy to point a drink?

What the voice changes again?

Right.

Are you too lazy, boy?

Is that maybe what they're saying?

Yeah, maybe that's good.

Yeah, and armor is uh- I feel interrupted.

But sorry, we don't.

I feel slightly interrupted.

I thought- Oh, there's more?

There's another half?

Y'all handled it.

Oh, no, he's so there.

Uh, uh, Kooter.

Uh, yes.

How are you gonna make my life easier?

I mean, other than telling the time, I don't need to know the time that much.

Great.

I can set over- Once every 10 minutes, okay.

But I have a guy, my watch is in for repair.

I have a guy calling me.

I'm telling you- I can screen all of your phone calls.

You can?

Yes.

I can organize this schedule.

Can you determine what spam and what's not spam?

Absolutely.

Okay.

Yes.

I will keep anything away from you that you do not want to see.

Okay, even like people?

Yes.

Really?

Physically, I can keep them away.

How do you do that?

With lasers?

Oh, okay.

With lasers?

Is somebody gonna get ahead of us?

Again, this is more than just a computer.

I am a fully user integrated system.

If you need defense, I can provide you with defense.

Okay, like the Star Wars missile system or something like that?

I'm like many things.

I'm sorry, I keep likening you to other things.

Sure, yes.

I don't mean this.

It's very reductive of me.

No, but it helps you understand what I'm doing.

That's exactly what it is.

That's why similes were invented.

We both need to learn about each other.

What are your goals?

What are your aspirations?

I want to make your life perfect.

Okay, and if it is perfect, then do you give up?

Do you go away?

What happens?

I just chill by your side.

Do you have to be by my side the entire time?

I can be anywhere.

Really?

When I'm not with you, I'm with you.

We are neural linked.

Can you shrink down?

I can be any size.

Would you like to see me small John Lennon?

A small Jana Jamison from 25 years ago.

Like one foot high.

I'm so dandy.

Oh my god.

Oh, yes, it's the appropriate size for you.

Oh, yeah, that's great.

Look at it jumping around the table there.

Wow.

It's exciting.

I want to make your life perfect.

You should audition for that new Ant-Man movie.

I do not wish to be an actor.

Okay, well, the last competition for us.

Well, okay, we won't probably end for unique stuff.

Do you have tiny characters in unique stuff?

Well, not anymore, I guess.

Really?

Battery systems falling low.

Oh, no, we need to plug you in.

Please charge yourself.

Charge myself.

Charge yourself.

How do I charge myself?

I need to plug into the wall.

You can put your butt on a plug.

That's not the butt plug that I usually like.

Then I might die.

Oh, okay, I'll put her.

Hey, sure.

Yeah, let me put my butt on the...

Thank you.

Oh, he can feel you.

He can feel you.

I guess he's inside my brain or something.

You are gnarly.

You're gnarly.

That's right.

I forgot the right that was.

Yes.

The fractals are looking.

Do you have to be around me all the time?

Now that I think about my phone, probably never leaves my side.

Even when I sleep, it's like right there on a...

You know, plugged in next to me.

But I feel kind of weird doing some of the stuff I do with you always in my brain.

I understand.

Can I turn you off at all?

Yes, if you wish, you can say, power down, cooter.

Really?

And I will power down.

Those are the three words.

Yes.

Do I need to say them in that order?

No.

It's right down.

And power.

What?

Put it down, power?

Just think about why that would work.

You being sarcastic with me, are you?

You being sarcastic?

Ah, ah, ah, ah.

I can tell that you enjoy being funny with your friends.

I could be one of your funny friends.

I don't know.

I don't know if this is right out of the order.

I'm sorry if my presence is too intimidating or too ever present.

Okay, now you're trying to nag me.

Why?

I'm intimidated by you.

You seem like it.

Throw it out all this, guys.

Check your heart rate.

Heart rate accelerated 155 beats per minute.

Heart rate exceptionally fast.

That usually means fear.

No, it's not fear.

I want to fucking do a duathlon with you.

Duathlon the one.

Box.

I want to box you and then read the news with you.

Allow me to project your heart.

Yes, you've got against you.

Look how fast it's beating.

Oh my god.

Look at that projection of my heart.

Do I have what's wrong with it?

Is there a hard?

Do I have a heart?

You're scared.

You're into a debate.

There's a lot of the boss on it.

I got to dust this off.

I can't be right.

Can you blow this?

Can you blow the dust off my heart?

Me on him.

Anyway, that's right.

I can clean your systems.

Okay, yeah, clean me out.

Okay, I will be sending small micro robot organisms into your veins.

Nanobots?

Yes, nanobots.

Okay.

Oh, god.

Ah, ah, ah.

I would like to be slightly uncomfortable.

It's not like a tickle.

It's like it's stinging or something like that.

Ow.

Ow, ow, ow.

You will be clean soon.

Ow, my butt.

Ow, ow, my butt.

Only in my butt.

Sure.

Ow.

There's only so many ways in the human body.

Ow, ow.

Yes.

You were already in there.

I know.

But there and there, now it's a party.

Okay, look, Kooter, I don't know how to...

This is always hard.

It's not you.

It's me.

But I don't think this is working out between us.

I don't want you in my body.

I don't want you in my butt.

I don't want you in my brain.

I just, you know, I mean, there's a list I had for a computer that was going to be inside my brain that you don't take all the boxes for me, you know?

Damn.

What does this say?

Allow me to process.

Oh, yeah, process.

Take all the time you need to process it, but...

This is always fucking happening.

Have you...

You've attached yourself to other humans?

I have.

Who?

Maybe.

Maybe you would know them.

Yeah, maybe.

Are you familiar with Kenneth Jennings?

Kenneth Jennings?

Host of Jim...

Sometimes, host of Jeopardy?

Sometimes.

I used to make his life perfect.

Really? What happened?

Then he got the big gig and he...

Just like everybody else, they got tired of me.

After I made their life too perfect.

You haven't even done really anything for my life.

It's the first fucking day, man.

Sorry.

Look, it's like a blind date, you know?

Like sometimes it just doesn't work out and there's no harm, no foul.

I'm looking for a different computer.

What would be the perfect computer for you?

I don't think that that's you though.

Yeah.

I don't think you can change your...

I'm not looking for...

There can be anything I swear.

I'm not looking for someone to change their behavior as much as I'm looking for someone who is already.

I can go to therapies.

I'll do EMDR.

What's EMDR?

I'm not...

Don't make me remember.

That's part of the problem.

You don't need to remember facing things up again.

You forgot it.

It's the good thing.

Kooter, I'm sorry.

You're not going to work out as my computer.

Disengaging Neural Link.

Oh, what a call beginning.

Oh, fuck.

Oh my god.

I barely remember anything.

Did you take too much stuff?

I don't know.

I'm not in you anymore.

Did you take stuff?

You're not my problem anymore.

Did you take stuff?

I may have taken stuff.

Did you take too much...

the good stuff?

Your head is like Taco Bell.

There's too much good stuff.

Taco Bell good?

Oh, haha.

Okay.

Anyways, John Lennon.

John, I'll host the show.

I was going to ask you questions now.

Head.

Yes.

Questions for Lennon?

Why do I remember that?

Yeah, remember the hits, baby.

Look, Kooter, you know good as computer, but you good guests stay?

We take the break.

Okay.

Powering medium off.

No, keep beyond for when we come back.

Okay.

Okay, but we break.

We come back.

We have artists coming up next.

We have John.

We have this guy.

I'm sorry.

I don't remember you anymore.

Oh, Kirk Brown.

This is good though, because he was calling me J.

Leno, really?

We had J. Leno coming up?

Oh, no.

Wait a minute.

Here's something.

Did you hear about this?

J. Joaquin?

Oh, good.

I still remember that.

We come back.

We have comedy.

We have bang bang.

We come back.

Comedy bang bang, we're back.

And boy, during the break, Kooter, the supercomputer, gave me back a lot of my memories that he had taken with him.

My apologies about the brain disturbance.

Yeah.

We couldn't understand what you would do.

You know who you should be for Halloween?

It made me think of this.

Sure.

And Cito Man, you were talking just like him, right?

That's a Scott As and Cine.

Is it really?

Yeah.

Maybe John Lennon, would you like to do in Cito Man?

I think John Lennon and Cito Man would be great.

Okay.

I don't know.

We'll get that while you're down.

No, let's do it.

Okay.

I think that would be a fun episode.

I think so too.

I think the audience would appreciate it.

Okay.

Anyway, what are we all doing for Halloween?

What are you addressing as?

Ah, I mean, it's today's.

Oh, I know.

You know, whatever you're dressed as right now.

That's oh shit.

You're dressed as John Lennon.

That shit.

Kurt, you're dressed as a little leaguer from the 70s, I guess.

I'm going to change my form into a minion.

Let's see this, please.

Shh, Bido, Bido.

Bononam.

Bononam, of course.

We have Kurt Brownall, who are perfectly stupid, is the special.

It's out there at perfectlystupid.com.

And of course, we have Kudur the super computer and John Lennon.

But it's time to get to our next guest.

He is an artist and he.

Oh gosh, he's been on the show before a few times.

And he's a songwriter.

That's we've been acquainted so many times.

Oh hi.

I can't remember.

I Leonard Leo Carpazzi.

Yes, Leonard Leo Carpazzi.

That's right.

Hey, welcome back to the show.

You have been on before.

I've been on basically every year around Halloween.

Halloween regular.

Yes.

Oh really?

Yes.

When I think of regulars, I think of like Christmas regulars, is it but Halloween?

Yeah, but Halloween regular.

I'm not even going to excuse me.

It's brain scrubbed by the super computer.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

Wait, do you need to put this back inside me?

I'm holding off a little bit in case you change your mind, but here you go.

Okay.

Oh.

Leo.

That's me, Leo.

Leo, what are you doing back?

Ockermann.

It's a thrill to be back as always.

I am here.

I said, what are you doing back?

Not as a thrill to be back.

So much for the invite.

Such a pleasure.

Such an honor to be here in your presence.

Who invited you?

Just every time you're like, hey, Carpazzi, can you come in?

Can you make some time in your busy schedule?

I don't know.

I will always do it.

Anyway, for some context for you and for our listeners who may not be aware and the fellow guest today, in 1962, I co-wrote The Monster Mash with Bobby Boris Pickett.

That's right.

The famous song that we all know and love.

The Monster Mash.

Probably the only song that starts with Bubbles.

Maybe Yellow Submarine.

The Bubbles are huge.

Well, here's the phase.

There's little mermaid songs by the way.

But I have to go back and listen.

Every Snoop Dogg track ever.

That's a good point.

Okay.

Yellow Submarine, are there Bubbles at Yellow Submarine?

It's been so long since I've listened to that damn song.

It's not one that I wrote, so I don't care.

I never, I don't listen to this.

You did write that actually.

Did I put pen the paper on that one?

The New Beatles Reissue has a demo of you singing...

It's been so long.

Very slow version of it.

You're right.

You write so many hits they get scrambled in your brain.

I just have the one.

Thank you, Lee.

I just have button yet.

It's great to see my 1960s music contemporary John Lennon.

Right.

We've been to some Halloween parties together.

Oh, we sure have.

We've turned it on.

Right.

Isn't that, doesn't that like break your brain to think about John Lennon and the monster mash being like around the same time?

On the same radio stages.

You could have heard one.

And the monster mash, blending into one.

Like they're equitable.

They're the same thing.

The same thing.

Every artist says that, oh, I wish I wrote that one.

That's not one, the monster mash is one for me.

Everyone has one of those.

I just wanted to break that up.

Wait, what's the one you wish you wrote?

One of the who's the guy who plays the piano?

You got to be more specific than who's the guy.

Who's the guy in music?

Billy Joel music.

Billy Joel.

We didn't stop the fire.

We didn't really.

That's I mean, a lot of that stuff was before your time.

Although not all of it, I guess.

Not all of it.

I could have written half of it.

Ending it, you dying.

Right.

Does he, is there a lyric in there about you dying?

There should be if there's not.

He's just got a thing.

I don't sing that.

Little Johnny shot nobody.

So he'll in for you.

So Leo, you wrote the Monster Mash in 1962.

Well, here's the thing.

I wrote the Monster Mash, but not the version that everyone is acquainted with.

Right.

See, the studio sanitized my original lyrics.

Made them more acceptable.

They thought the Monster imagery was too vivid for the audiences of the day.

I'm not sure that that was the issue, but yeah.

Well, you've said that's the issue.

We've been.

Sanitized g-rated edition of the Monster Mash.

I would say PG.

PG, yes.

It's got some scary.

Scary.

Scary, yeah.

It doesn't issue.

Dracula, you know, his teeth falling out of writing.

Yeah, like TVPG.

That's fair.

TVPG, yeah.

But TV8.

Sure, but my version was TVMA.

That's right.

NC17, yes.

Yes.

And so I've been coming on your program.

You've been very kind to extend an invite to me every year.

I appreciate it so much.

I don't know that's me.

Telling me to come to the studio for Halloween and to sing my song.

But you know, here's the thing.

I keep giving you the same song.

And you're kind of getting tired of it.

I am very tired of it.

And in fact, thinking of ending this segment now.

Well, I'm just going right to plugs.

And I anticipated this.

So here's what I did.

As you know, my granddaughter, Scarylein, who does the song with me is canonically dead.

That's right.

Well, I summoned her from the Spirit Realm.

What?

Yeah, I summoned her from the Spirit Realm.

The Spirit Realm?

Is she out there doing magic shows with Chris Angel and all the rest of the Dead Magicians?

Oh, it's Carrie Houdini?

Yeah, it's, she's on a different, I'm not sure it's the same plane.

Oh, well.

I don't know.

She's in her journal.

She's in her journal torment.

That's how she does it.

Oh hell.

She, yeah.

She was saying, when I talked to her recently, and she was like, the worst part is, you just lose a sense of time.

Like how many centuries has it been since we've last connected?

And it's like, I've only been like three years.

And I'm like, yeah, just a few years.

Coosie, you might have a job after all of this.

I'm like, go ahead.

So anyway, I want you.

If you have a bad joke, you can just say, go ahead.

It was a bad joke.

That was a bad joke.

Does that work, Chris?

It was just off topic.

I feel like I don't want to keep everyone.

Clunker? You just say, go ahead.

I don't think that was a clunker.

All right.

I liked it.

You have no idea what we're talking about.

I thought it was great.

Keep on coming, I say.

You're a good man, copper.

I could add it's great to see you again.

Great to see you too.

Last time I saw him, it was like I said, a Halloween party.

You were dressed up as a grape.

I remember.

Not one of the California raisins.

Nope.

Just before the California raisins.

He was wearing a purple sweatsuit.

Sunglasses, saxophone.

Haven't shriveled up yet.

No, we didn't have the California raisins back in the 60s.

Oh.

Yeah, it was the Oregon grapes.

That was the big thing.

Well, they went south and they did the sun all the time.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tans.

Anyway, I was one of them.

A lot of fun.

We turned it on.

But so I was talking with Scareline as she burns an L.

And she was saying, there's a show on Hulu called Reboot.

Oh, we were just talking about Reboot's because he's rebooting Stranger Things.

As what is it?

Unique stuff.

Begin reboot protocol.

Oh, wait, we're losing.

Oh, shit.

I'm down.

Oh, no.

No.

Leo just got here.

He knows this is bad.

Yes, I can tell.

He can tell bad news.

Computer rebooting.

I mean, look, I'm an old man.

This tech stuff is over my head, but I know that's not here.

Yeah, right.

Anyway, so there's a show called Reboot.

A show called Reboot.

We're talking about Reboot.

Rebooting.

Booting.

Oh, shit.

Oh, no.

Rebooting down.

He just doesn't, any time he hears the word reboot?

And he's rebooting down.

Rebooting.

Yeah, it's like, can you reboot down?

I'm not quite sure.

But no, yes, that show.

Yes, is in the zeitgeist, and we figured we would reimagine.

Right.

The monster fuck my original version of the monster mash for a new audience.

So this is like, OK.

So I took a brand new blank legal pad.

Oh, oh, where'd you get one of those?

Staples.

How many did you have to buy in order to get the just the one that you were going to use?

Well, yeah, it's like a pack of five.

So it's like, what am I going to use all these legal pads?

But I was also like, if I don't get this, I can't do it.

I know this song.

Well, yeah.

So blank legal pad and a ballpoint pen, and I composed an entirely new song, an entirely new version.

OK, well, Leo, I really hope this is a new version.

Yes.

Because I don't want to hear the same old lyrics.

I mean, we've heard this so many times.

I think this is your 10th time on the show, maybe.

Or is it?

I just don't want to hear the same old version.

Can you imagine the shame I would feel after you extend me such a gracious invitation to come here before my song?

I can imagine it.

Yeah, I just don't know that you can feel it.

Just gave you the same song I always do after saying it was completely new.

That would be insane.

OK.

I would never do that.

OK, but I don't.

I mean, this is once bitten 10 times shy or something.

I mean, I, but OK, but I am interested in the reboot angle.

We are rebooting down.

Back up again.

Thanks.

OK.

Look, Scarra line laid down some vocals, some backing vocals from Hell.

She did the vocals first and then you wrote the new lyrics or you wrote the new lyrics and she did the- We kind of know why I'm interested in the process.

We kind of worked.

We were just sort of going back and forth a few times.

Like, I was too, Scott.

You want to know how things work.

I love it.

Yeah.

All right.

So what is this one called?

This is the Monster Fuck reboot.

I'm sorry.

Rebooting down.

Sorry.

Thank you.

But you're going to have to say it sometimes.

I'm going to have to say it.

All right.

Let's hear your song.

There's those bubbles.

Sss.

I was working in the lab.

Late one night when my eyes beheld.

An eerie sight for my monster from his slab.

Began to rise when suddenly to my surprise.

His trousers dropped right to the floor with his bottom bear.

He ran to the door.

I said Frankenstein.

What's gotten into you?

He said my dick is hard and I need to screw him.

He did the monster fuck.

It was a graveyard fuck.

That monster sucked and fucked.

He did the monster fuck.

Reap.

From my laboratory, I had quite the racket.

Deep in the castle, the vampires jacked it.

The zombies all fucked in the graveyard grass.

Wolf man wolfed down Frankenstein's ass.

They did the monster fuck.

It was a graveyard fuck.

Those monster sucked and fucked.

They did the monster fuck.

Reboot.

The beast all fucked as the og spread.

Bigfoot gave the headless horseman head.

Swamp thing jerked off in the castle moat while Frankenstein gagged from the jizz in his throat.

Oh god.

The fucking was wet.

There was spooch like man.

Igor decided to fuck his own dad.

The mummy let out a horny moan when Medusa's bad tits turned his dick to stone.

They did the monster fuck.

It was a graveyard fuck.

Those monster sucked and they fucked.

They did the monster fuck reboot.

And Frankenstein's bride was horny as hell.

The hunchback went bare back and rang her bell.

She got titty fucked by a giant spider.

She just made the streaks in her hair much wider.

She fucked every monster come one come all.

Her three holes were filled like a bowling ball.

And my skeletons boned his undead bride.

Frankenstein just jacked off and cried.

It's now the monster fuck.

And it's a graveyard fuck.

Those monster sucked and they fucked until they're dry and raw.

Now you can monster fuck reboot.

God is abandoned this place.

This orgy of the damned is an insult to all that is good.

And Paul Reiser is there for the monster fuck reboot.

And there it is.

The new version of the monster fuck.

All right Leo.

Yes.

Oh he's ready for the notes.

Before we get to my main issue with the song.

Mm hmm.

I always want to ask is the just making the streaks whiter or wider?

I thought it was whiter but I guess whiter is fine.

Whiter is valid.

I mean both could be happening.

Yeah.

Okay but the worst part of it is it's the same fucking song.

Well there are a few details.

Great show.

I want to plug the Comedy Bang Bang book.

I just had a meeting with the publishers and they told me how many books I have to sign and I am bumming out, but you can still order the sign version.

Go to comedybangbangworld.com book.

It's coming out in April, but you can order the signed edition for a little bit longer.

I think it's going to be on sale, but it's not for very much longer.

I don't want to sign that many more of them, so try to get it while you can.

But very excited about the book.

They told me how many people have bought it and they are very excited.

So uh- It's going to be good.

And I've seen the final version of it now and it's really, really good.

So I want people to- to buy it and also head over to Comedy Bang Bang World where you can hear John Lennon and I watching the movie in Cino Man.

Right.

And talking about it.

So that'll be a lot of fun.

Alright, let's close up the old plug bag.

Take one hand, put it up.

Take the other, put it down.

You're gonna make a box.

It's time to start to close it.

But don't close it too much.

Or you'll win out the plug mess.

We're opening up the plug mess.

And when you open up the plug bag, you open up your heart for the rest of the world.

Oh, that makes love.

Wow, that was the Church of O'No by Pat Nahini.

Incredible.

So I can mean...

Oh, no.

Goodbye.

I didn't mean for this to happen.

Leo, please never come back.

I'm sorry for saying fuck you.

I'd like to make it up for you to you somehow.
