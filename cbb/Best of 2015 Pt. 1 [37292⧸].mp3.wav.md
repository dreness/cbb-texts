♪♪♪ I'm not a doctor, but I play one on WebMD, where you might recognize my catchphrase.

You definitely have syphilis.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Did I say Comedy Bang Bang?

I believe I did.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

First of four best of episodes.

First of four, that is right.

This is B-O-2-0-1-5-1.

Sounds like a Star Wars droid, doesn't it?

♪♪♪ Oh, we gotta go into the new one.

♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Welcome to the Comedy Bang Bang show for our best of.

That was, of course, the cantina theme original version mixed with a little reggae.

Of course, it was both of those.

If you have not seen the new Star Wars, that's the only spoiler we'll give here today.

There's a little bit of reggae music in it.

Aaargh, reggae man!

So make sure you get to a theater post-haste if you are a reggae fan.

Now, did you hear the rumor that one of the cantina characters was actually Adrian Brody, were appraising his famous Rostamand character from SNL?

Booyu Kishan!

I'll never, ever forget.

Sean John!

♪♪♪ Monek! Respect, Monek!

Respect, Monek!

I believe he was in there in the bag.

What do you call those reggae hats?

Hats?

You just call them hats, because you're such a reggae fan.

It's like Chinese food, too.

You're wearing them. Yeah.

Do you guys want to have some Chinese food?

From the food we eat here in China?

Welcome to...

Keep welcoming...

welcoming...

Is that what you said?

Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.

Welcome Nini.

Welcome Nini to the episode.

Oh, boy. God.

I look...

Welcome Nini to the episode.

I am Scott Ockerman, your host, of course, for Nia Ponce.

Nia Ponce, six and a half years now with this program.

Wow.

And yeah, pretty crazy.

How it keeps going, how time keeps marching on, and things occur, and then things do not occur, and yet progress is made.

Forward progress.

You say so.

Mm-hmm.

And...

Is something that just keeps continuing happening, consider progress?

I don't know.

You know, it'd be interesting if, say, time occurred, like, you did a day, and then you went backwards a little bit, and then you went forwards a little bit, you know?

That's how I feel all the time, Scott.

Ah!

Right about!

I'm getting used here.

Brr!

By the way, the new cantina theme was, I believe, partially written or written, or I'm not...

I haven't checked the press materials yet that were passed out in my script.

That's right.

When are we going to go through that press kit?

For Star Wars before we work with...

Because we are critics, of course.

Yes.

Well, this is considered to be a critical program.

We're influencers, Scott, what influencers.

Yes, that's right.

But that was, I believe, co-written or written by one of our new friends, uh...

Lin- What do you all...

You were searching for the name.

I didn't know what the text was.

No, I wasn't searching for the name.

I was searching for...

You're a cosign from you.

Oh sure, absolutely.

To nod.

Yes, of course.

Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton.

A composer of Hamilton.

Yes.

A composer in Star.

Composer in Star of Hamilton.

Yes.

And I will be...

If you're listening to this when it comes out, I'll be seeing it tomorrow night.

I believe.

What if they're listening to it after it comes out?

Well, then, uh...

All bets are off.

And so, you're saying if people listen to this...

I am taking bets on this.

If people listen to this, they said 12 AM Pacific Standard Time.

Yes.

On...

PST.

Yeah, on Tuesday, I guess.

On Monday.

No, come down.

No, this comes out on Monday, yes.

Come down on Monday.

All right, I'll introduce you in a second.

But, uh, yes, he's...

He listens to this program, I believe.

He listens to this program.

He listens to the program.

He listens to the program with the pudding.

You're not gonna hear anything from much longer.

Night and night.

Since his receding.

Oh, boy.

That's not...

That's a big story that happened in 2015.

That counts.

That counts as something that we can talk about.

I feel like that's a little off-brand for me.

This is the best we ever.

Best we ever.

Why, we're having such a good time.

That's right.

And I have the former host of Best Week Ever right across from me.

Uh, he, of course, he only does these episodes on the best ofs.

Although, he did one in the...

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

He's been doing these episodes on the best ofs.

Although, he did one in the mid-year, I believe.

I believe so.

You know, which was a big treat to have him on.

But he'll be on for the next four episodes where we'll be counting down your top 14 comedy bang bang episodes.

Today we'll be going through 14 through 11, and then so on and so forth.

Oh, this one goes to 11?

Spinal time.

How culture reference?

Best week ever.

He was the former host of this program.

Best week ever.

I still am.

I still am the former host of that program.

I always will be.

Really?

You don't think that you'll ever not be the former host.

You'll be the current host.

Well, I don't think it's ever coming back with me as the host.

What if it did?

Well, it came back without me as the host.

That's true.

And then it died on its own.

Did it need a pie?

Yeah, that's right.

Um, Paul of Tomkins is here.

Oh, hi to me.

Happy holidays as...

Happy holidays.

This is the...

This is, uh, Christmas week and Boxing Day week.

That's right.

Those are the two holidays people mean when they say Happy Holidays?

Happy holidays?

No other holidays.

No other holidays at all.

Um, welcome back to the program.

It's very nice to see you.

Scott, it's always nice to see you.

Thank you for having me.

Mm-hmm.

This is, I love this time of year and one of the reasons I love it is because, is because Ignat.

Okay, close.

We have a couple of glasses right here.

See you guys next episode.

True.

Oh my God.

I do.

Do you like Ignat because I do?

I do.

I actually, uh, the widow Coolop and I, when we went out shopping for a, uh, get together we had recently, we bought a lot of alcoholic Costco.

Sure.

And I bought six giant jugs of pre-made whiskey eggnog.

Oh, with the booze already in.

With the booze already in.

I was like, oh, this is going to be a big hit at the party.

I believe one and a half of those giant jugs was, so we have four and a half.

May I say, Scott, I was at it?

Yeah, I'm on.

If this is the...

Hear me now!

Respect.

If, if this is the gathering that I was invited to.

The gathering.

Magic the gathering, yes.

This was the magic the gathering get together that I was invited to.

I didn't see.

I did not see that eggnog anywhere.

And I would have had some.

I know.

Well, at one point the bartender almost set fire to my kitchen by trying to heat some, like, he took it upon himself.

Really cool dude.

He'd heat some up.

Yeah, he, he pulled out a sauce pan, unbeknownst to Coolop or I, and he just, he just, he did some up in a sauce pan and then someone tapped me on the shoulder and said, hey, look.

I turned around.

There's a giant flames up, up to the ceiling.

But he was great.

A nice guy named Kevin.

He learned all of our names.

Did you notice that?

I did not notice that.

There were, there were quite a few people at this get together and he, he memorized everyone's name.

Do you think he used a demonic device?

He used, he used, he used all this soul to sit in.

So he just for that power.

Yeah.

So he was like a waste.

Um, you and I both seen Star Wars, so let's go through some spoilers.

Absolutely!

We're not.

Let's do piece R2D2.

Too soon.

R2D2 soon.

Anytime you're joking about the death of a robot, it's R2D2 soon.

Yes.

Anytime.

And how often does that come up?

Joking about the death of a robot.

More often than you think, but not that often still.

I guess joking about the movie I Robot.

Lots of robots.

Guy robot.

I hate those meo robots.

Don't joke about I Robot though.

I would never.

I Robot would never.

Um, so what else is going on for you this holiday season?

I mean, you're off to never, never land to do.

R2D2.

Yeah!

R2D2.

Do do do do.

Bow do do do do do do.

RIGGIE!

RIGGOTALICA.

Come on.

Oh, RIGGOTALICA.

So I bet somebody's done that?

I bet that is somewhere.

I was listening.

You know, I have close to 200,000 songs in my iTunes.

I just put on random.

Of course I know that.

And I have records that I've never listened to that one day, just one song will pop up in there.

And one of them is Beatalica, which is I believe Beatles songs done in the style of Metallica.

Absolutely.

And it's really funny to hear someone impersonate, what's his name, Headfield?

Or who's that guy?

Kirk?

Yeah, James Headfield?

James Headfield, yeah.

And basically all the guy does is goes, a day's a week off.

Worth it.

My wife and I...

I'm just going to let that pass.

Thank you.

We've traded music back and forth over the years, sharing songs with each other.

So sometimes I'll have a song in my library that absolutely is from her music collection.

Right.

And we'll be listening to her in the current slate.

Who's this?

Like, just like us from you?

I got this from you, Dad.

I don't know why, but it's always the maximum amount of incredulity when she's asking me.

Right.

What's this?

And what normally is it?

What type of music does she enjoy?

National Anthem.

She loves National Anthem.

Really, just from every country.

Every country.

What is the best National Anthem I'm trying to think?

Because pretty much Canada's and the United States of America are almost exactly the same.

Are they not?

Or are they a different tune?

I think they're different too.

What's the thing I'm thinking of?

You're thinking of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.

Right.

And the alphabet.

Right, ABCDFG.

How I wonder where you are.

But you are.

Got it.

Yeah.

By the way, in the public domain now.

That's right.

Happy birthday to Jeremy Piven.

Jeremy Piven.

After the midnight rave.

Oh my goodness.

What a big news story that was.

I mean, Scott, we could talk about that for four episodes.

Oh, were you in play?

There was a while there where I was like, wherever am I?

Where am I?

I've heard from anybody.

Oh.

That's a little inside talk here on television.

Should be outside.

More people should know about it.

Yep.

More people should know about the ins and outs of showbiz representation.

And people should be able to look at our bank accounts.

Yeah.

Transparent, Etsy.

Transparent is a big TV show.

Why not, you know?

Let's see how much they make.

Yeah.

Exactly.

If they're so transparent.

Should be the credits.

The closing credits.

But what everyone salary was.

Yeah.

Name, actor name, character, salary.

Come on.

Tambor.

Is this the call sheet?

I know you like that.

Yeah, I love that stuff.

You, by the way, you're, I want to hype this a little bit.

You are in a television show that I'm producing called The Gillian Dollar Properties, coming out first episode coming out in a few weeks.

And is it a bajillion dollar property dollar sign?

Sorry.

Bajillion dollar property.

Tie.

Dollar sign.

Yes, of course.

That's how it's, it's like number three years.

That's right.

That's how it's pronounced.

Or Cess seven.

Cess seven men.

Um, what you, what number are you on the call sheet for that?

Scott, inexplicably, I am number one.

You are number one.

Number one of the call sheet.

Very good.

So I'm middle.

So I've been number one on the call sheet.

What's so funny is I'm not even on the show every day.

So I'm, I'm still, for some reason, C seed on all communications with the show.

So I get the call sheets every day when I'm not working.

And I see that it starts with number two.

Right.

Always with number two because it's out of deference to your stature in the entertainment industry.

That's, that's what my old career has been leading up to is for someone to take pity on me and say, make him.

No, no, no, no, no.

This was no pity.

No, no, no, no, no.

This was cool.

Contractually obliged.

Is that so?

No, I think it was out of, out of deference to you.

That's very good.

Are you having a good time on that show?

We showed you a little bit of it the other day.

I, yes, I, I think you were threatening to show me more, but I was, it would make me so, I'm going to show you more.

Maybe so self-conscious to watch it with you guys, watch myself on, on a screen.

But I, you have a couple of great scenes in that.

You score big in it.

Oh, good.

I am very glad I had a great time working on that.

We're going to do a little more in the next month.

A little more.

Well, right.

Yep.

And it's a great group of people.

I love those kids.

They're all 30 years younger than I am.

Fresh.

I don't believe that is true.

I don't believe they're prepubescent.

They're all 10 years old.

But we found a great cast for it.

I do, I do want to talk about it just a little bit because I think people will want to see this.

But it's the widow Koolop show that she created and I'm producing it along with Tomlin and Ben Grant and Ben was directing and half the time with Alex Ferny and Alex was also directing.

And yeah, I mean, we found some great young improvisers who are the cast and you are their boss and you're sort of screen and off.

Wait a minute.

We're just bossing them around.

I was.

I was wondering why you were having like shoe shines done by them.

It was a lot.

I was adjusting their posture.

I was telling them to look sharp.

Books on their head.

That's right.

They were in finishing school.

That's right.

They should call it ending school.

Shouldn't they?

Why?

Because.

That's all I got because.

Hey, finishing school.

What about starting school?

You know what I mean?

What about staying in school?

That's kindergarten.

That's okay.

Yeah, you're right.

So look for that on CISO.

Bajillion Dollar Properties.

It's a very funny show and it really is a great cast and I had so much fun improvising with those guys.

Pulling a little more come the new year as well.

And yeah, so in a few weeks, I believe that'll be up on CISO.

So people should be figuring out their test.

Third March.

No, it premieres in March, but there is a the first episode goes up in a couple of weeks.

Oh, sneaky peaky.

Beaky peaky.

Yeah, peaky.

Freaky.

Finders.

Yeah.

So people should go to CISO and get the test.

What is it?

Not test, but trial run trial.

Yeah.

It's a trial or something like because everyone is due a free trial.

It is a subscription because of the constitution.

Right.

That's right.

Everyone is allowed a free, quick and speedy trial.

That's right.

They can get a trial membership to CISO with a jury of their peers.

Now you have to sit through a jury process.

Oh my goodness.

There is a trial.

It is the worst.

You ask people, have you ever seen television?

And then if they have, there's a qualified.

And when a jury of their peers, really a bunch of white people, a bunch of rich white people, come on.

Exactly.

Anyway, that'll be coming up soon.

And speaking of coming up soon, I do want to say that we have to get to our countdown, don't we?

Yeah.

Okay.

That's on the topic of coming up soon.

Yeah.

I mean, it's coming up right now.

I believe let's get to it.

Okay.

So sooner than that, we're going to be counting down your and you guys voted on this, by the way, you guys.

Yeah, this is on you.

This is on whatever, you know, we don't give a shit.

We just read it.

I could not fucking care less.

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

So, days and nights compiling these clips and figuring out time code.

Now, how do you determine the clips?

Do you ask people what are their favorite moments?

Here's what I do.

Okay.

And by the way, we're going to be listening to your top 14 on this countdown.

Couldn't quite sneak in the 15 just for amount of time that we have.

These are all long episodes.

Couldn't quite get the 15th in there.

I would have had to shorten every other clip so much that it wouldn't have been funny.

That's fair.

But basically, I figure out what the numbers are.

I go look at the episode page.

I will sometimes read.

I'll try to remember it from memory and go, what was funny in that?

But what is more effective is to go to the message boards and kind of read people's reactions to it at the time because a lot of times people will go, oh, this was so funny when they said that.

I'll sort of give that a cursory skim.

And I usually have to listen to the entire episode in order to remember what was really funny and while taking notes and time code notes, and then I'll go back and figure out the time code.

Now, yes.

It is important to note that you are doing this on your own time.

No one is really helping you out with this.

No, I mean, you don't have to do this.

That old engineer Cody Ryan over here is helping us out here on one of the days off from the studio.

So that's really nice.

That is very nice of him to do.

I mean, what I mean is, is that this is a thing that you are providing that you don't have to do this.

Well, it's a passion project.

Yes.

We started the best of six years ago, I believe.

And it's something that I enjoy doing, although it takes too much fucking time.

It's a celebration?

It's a celebration.

You eat the salad, Brian.

It's a celebration.

Bye, Jim.

We need to celebrate.

What dialect is it?

What do I elect is it?

It's a celebration, baby.

It's a celebration.

It's a celebration, bice.

That is a horrifying dialect.

I know we have fans out there, and where is it?

Australia or New Zealand?

That's what we were attempting to do.

What's the deal?

Who cares out there?

Look, I will be visiting you, though.

I believe we may be.

No, really?

Going out there this year.

Oh, fingers crossed.

Yes.

So much fun.

I was there with the Thrilling Adventure Hour in New Zealand and Australia this past year, and it was a lot of fun.

And hopefully you'll be coming out to Australia and New Zealand this year with us.

But we'll talk about that a little later in our countdown.

But let's waste no more time.

Let's get to it.

Let's get to number 14.

Number 14.

That's right.

Number 14 is here.

That's right.

Yeah, it is right.

That's right.

I said it.

It's right.

It occurred.

That's right.

Number 14 is here.

This is number 14 on your countdown.

It narrowly beat out number 15, which is...

Why do I have...

Stammerers' paradise?

Stammerers?

Yes.

When I walk through the valley, it narrowly beat out...

Is y'all my daddy?

Oh, wow.

Which was the continuing saga of JW Stillwater.

That's right.

The introduction of Professor Steelwater.

Steelwater, really.

Yes, his daddy.

And which had, of course, Carmen, his young word, Carmen.

Caramel.

Caramel, sorry.

Caramel, that's pizito.

Yes, Cameron, that's pizito.

Narrowly beat out.

You will not be hearing that clip today, but go back and check that episode out.

You're really sure.

This is, of course, episode number 329 from all the way back January 12.

Oh, wow.

The second episode of...

No, actually the third episode in the calendar year of 2015.

We had two episodes before it.

This is January 12.

This is the Too Much Tuna Tour.

Absolutely.

That's right.

With Nick Kroll and John Mulaney.

That's right.

That is right.

Who keeps saying it's not right?

Who among you?

Oh, step forward.

If not now, when?

And if not who, then you.

This was the, as I said, the third episode back in the new year.

And this was really fun.

It's basically Nick Kroll came on.

Nick Kroll.

Nick Kroll came on.

Nick Kroll.

He was just about to premiere the final season of Kroll Show.

And he was there to explain why he was leaving a very funny pre-character segment.

By the way, if you've...

He's a funny guy.

If you've never listened to Comedy Bang Bang before, and maybe you just were given an iPod, that's always my theory.

And gets an iPod on Christmas and they go, what is the podcast?

Serial?

And then they run out of serial to listen to and they go, all right, you know, find something else.

Bet season two though, just started with Bob Bergdorff.

Who's that?

He's the host of the new season of serial.

Oh, he is really what happened to whoever her name was.

Oh, I don't know.

I think she got murdered.

And this is a...

Wait, by the first guy?

Yeah, they're trying to solve her.

They're trying to solve her.

That would be the best season two of all time.

That's right.

Of course, from the supermarket chain and 4 NFL great.

Yeah, murdered, what's her name?

That's right.

Murdered Walter Koenig.

From Star Trek?

Check out Star Trek.

By the way, Scott, I know you got business to do.

Yeah.

Tell me this happened when you saw Star Wars.

There were 30 minutes of trailers before the movie, right?

Because people...

You know, the little ass of the arc light.

The movie business is like, let's... we have a captive audience.

Let's show them everything.

They showed a Star Trek trailer before Star Wars.

And at the end of it, everyone booed.

And it really made me laugh.

A lot of people upset about this new Star Trek trailer, including even Simon Pegg, I guess, a friend of the show who was interviewed recently and had...

and they asked him about the new Star Trek trailer and his face could not hide his embarrassment about it.

And it's purely just because they're using...

Listen, all of y'all!

This is sabotage!

Throughout the entire thing.

Because young Kirk plays it when he's like a five-year-old kid driving around that car or something.

Something like that.

And he's like, remember that time I drove around that car and played that old, old hundreds of years old song?

Yeah.

I'm gonna listen to that.

It's the rest of my life.

It's not a great trailer.

I thought it looked alright.

But I thought it was funny that the Star Wars audience booed the Star Trek trailer.

Do you think it was because they were at Star Wars and they were booing Star Trek?

Yes.

I think it's because they hated the trailer.

Oh no.

Because there were some other shitty trailers.

You did not get that treatment.

I just think that there is a big backlash against that trailer.

That particular trailer.

Perhaps you're right.

Maybe.

I don't know.

Well, that's a great idea to disagree.

Maybe it was just people going, this is Star Wars!

Not Trek!

I think that's what it was, Scott.

I think people who like Star Wars like Star Trek, though, too.

Of course there's crossover.

Scott Darling, of course there is.

It's only the stars, my dear boy.

One's a long time ago, one's in the future.

Exactly.

What if they're both in the same universe?

You know what I mean?

What if we're in the same universe as both of them?

Well, obviously we're in the same universe as Star Trek.

Is it obvious?

Because...

Because in Star Trek...

For the voice home, they come back here.

There are multiple universes, though.

That's right.

This is the multiple universe theories that would be new Star Trek.

That's right.

Anyway, this is what it is.

The multiple universe theory is, there might be a different universe other than Star Trek.

I feel like we're getting wildly, of course, here.

What were we doing?

We were talking about episode number...

Episode 14!

Or too much to the tour.

So, if you've never heard this before, Comedy Bang Bang, basically.

And these best-ups are where we pull back the curtain and we talk about the making of the show.

Basically what we do on the show.

Sausage times.

This is how the bread is made.

Usually the show, it's always hosted by me and...

Always.

I know.

It's the worst.

And the first segment is usually talking to a star of stage or screen.

Could be a big screen, could be a small screen.

But usually I'll talk to someone as themselves for a while.

And then I will have several comedians playing fake characters on the program.

At least one.

At least one in either the next segment or in the middle of the first segment or sometimes at the beginning.

But that's what the show is.

Well, let's nail down where they come in.

Which segment?

You want time code?

No, it's always me talking to, usually talking to one real person and then one or more several fake people.

Yes.

Sometimes it'll all be fake people.

We've done episode four.

That's very rare.

It's very rare.

But sometimes we do it.

But in this particular instance...

Sometimes we discuss it up.

Sometimes, and maybe this is what you are going to speak to.

Sometimes a real person will start out as themselves and then they'll go away.

And they'll go away.

And then they'll come back as the character.

And that's exactly what happened here.

Wow.

I was just talking to Nick Croll as himself about Croll Show.

Meanwhile, John Mulaney, who's a great comedian, a lot of people know him as the creator of...

What's that guy's name?

Fred Rico.

Stefan.

Fred Rico.

I don't know.

SNL Stefan.

Now, you haven't watched SNL since Gary Kroger was on.

No, I will not.

He was your last favorite.

I've only watched Gilbert Godfried from the original cast.

That's right.

My original cast.

That's right.

When I first started watching.

And when they left, I was out.

Once Denny Dillon was not in the mix anymore, forget it.

But yeah, John Mulaney, great stand of comedian, has a Netflix special out right now.

Very funny watching the other night.

Yep.

The comeback hit.

The gentleman...

Yes, I was going to say the gentleman collard.

The lady vanishes.

Sorry, John Mulaney.

I feel a lot of things wrong.

But wildly wrong though.

Yeah, very very often.

There's that.

By the way, I'm not doing with this.

I felt it very important to flatten this empty tissue box.

Oh my god.

I have a fire going.

It's the season.

So John Mulaney was just watching us.

And then Nick went away and they came back as their characters, George St. Gigland and Gil Fizon.

Characters they've done for a long time.

They've done them on croll show.

They get pranked with too much tuna.

And they currently they just wrapped up their off-Broadway run yesterday and I was there in the audience of Oh Hello.

Were you really?

Yes, I was.

Oh, so funny.

I wish I'd seen that.

And so they came back as these characters and they just went on probably an hour long uninterrupted run of just stream of consciousness rambling.

That was really really funny.

Yes, it was.

And so we're going to hear that basically it starts off.

They're talking about 2014.

Reminder, this was in January of 2015.

So they're sort of recapping 2014 and all of the celebrities they'd lost over the year.

Let's hear that.

This is your episode 14.

Number one, four.

Well guys, it's 2015.

I mean time is passing so quickly, is it not?

Yeah.

And what a year that we just saw.

2015.

No.

2014.

We lost so many greats.

So many greats.

So many people.

Yeah, we did.

Jin Rivers.

Of course.

Yeah.

Robin.

Robin Williams who could think of.

I thought you meant Batman's partner.

Robin.

Oh, who's that?

No, but I know.

Well, Chris O'Donnell did die.

Chris O'Donnell died this year.

Yeah.

Tim Allen.

We lost Tim Allen.

It's I still.

It's hard for me to.

I'm about to cry.

So don't it?

It's hard for me to.

George.

Talk about Tim Allen because you know, he did so much for cocaine.

Yeah, big influence on you in the terms of cocaine.

That you could sell cocaine and then still make something else.

Still make a lot of money in a non cocaine field.

Yeah.

Well, it's not that acting is in a non cocaine field.

And he did so much cocaine.

Yeah.

He only he not only did so much for cocaine, for cocaine, but he actually did a lot.

Yeah, of cocaine.

He did a lot of cocaine.

But he asked for forgiveness.

He did.

Didn't he or did he not?

I can't remember.

I can't and we lost soul bellows, of course.

Oh, saw bellows.

Who was saw bellows again?

One of the great writers that I never read.

Oh, yeah.

I know Mr. Bellows on a dream of genie.

Oh, that was him.

That was the right.

Yeah.

No, it really.

Yeah.

And of course we lost genie Triple Horn.

Oh, God.

Terrible.

Terrible loss.

It's crazy to think about.

Basic instinct.

I mean, you would I called Gil one day and I said, hey, how's Ricky like doing?

And he said, she's gone.

And I said, wait, God, gen vacation?

He said, no, George.

She's got.

She passed.

She passed from us.

She died this year.

Wow.

You know, do you want to know three more people that have died this year?

I want to know those.

These are exclusives.

Okay.

So no one else knows about these?

No one knows.

Okay.

Dominique Wilkins.

The human highlight film is passed.

Absolutely.

Dead that is should door not.

100% dead.

110% anyone coming forward is Dominique Wilkins is a little imposter.

I can't believe I cannot believe that we lost Harvey.

I tell this year.

Oh, I've got to die in 2000.

What a terrible loss.

And but you know, it's to be honest, we lost him years ago.

He died to me after he made the PNA.

Really?

So we saw that little PNA, his in the piano, double snub nose.

Yeah.

That little sort of shot.

That sort of.

How many films have we seen as penis in?

Not enough.

Not enough, man.

I don't know.

I don't know if I'm going to go to the airscars this year because so many of my my pals are gone.

Oscar Isaac, an up and coming star.

He passed away.

He died in 2014.

Oh, my gosh.

Just right before the release of his film, a most violent year.

And it was for him having succumbed to death.

How did he die?

He desecomed.

He succumbed.

How?

What happened?

He he fought.

He really fought it.

Yeah.

His hair grew inside of his face.

His hair grew in inwards.

You can't have that.

That full head of hair.

When you see a guy with a full head of hair, they got to be careful because that hair will grow inwards.

That would go in.

Yeah.

It's the opposite of a haircut.

Yeah.

So the hair wrapped around his head.

Hair works both ways.

Strangle his medulla.

It absolutely crushed his brain and all the money in the world.

And he was he was he was by the end he was a millionaire.

He was one of the two films richest men in America.

One of the richest people in the world.

But at the end of the day when your numbers up.

Those numbers that you have in the bank account aren't going to add up.

That's right.

And who can and who I can't even believe that Diane very first in.

Oh no, you're kidding me.

DVF.

And we want to have Barry's doing with it.

Maryland Manson is dead.

Maryland Manson.

No, this is Justin.

This is my nose.

Wait, you're getting this on the news wire?

I had a feeling on my way over.

Yep.

I can't believe.

This is all the songs that he could have sang.

All the goth dark goth songs that won't be recorded.

What is I'm an uninformed person and I know he's responsible for Columbine.

So I don't maybe it's not a loss.

It's not the tragedy.

All the survivors of Columbine passed this.

All of them?

The T-coats.

The T-coat Moth.

Remember when they won that Oscar for that song?

The trench coat Moth.

Yeah, yeah.

Hard out of here for his rimp.

It's going to be hard.

What was that?

The jib jib jib we submitted.

That was jib jib jib.

This is what gets me.

In all this death I want to talk about this.

We made a jib jib that was his hard out here for his rimp.

And not even a word.

Not even one view.

It's crazy.

It's crazy how much they ignored us.

You guys can view it yourselves and you would rack up at least one or two.

I can't watch my own stuff.

He's so self-conscious.

I'm so self-conscious.

Oh, I get it.

I get it.

So self-conscious.

Yeah.

My God, just the terrible losses we've suffered this year.

And then this year if we rest New Yorkers and we are real New Yorkers.

You are.

And we'll be doing a New York signing of the new tuna book, Tuna Head Companion.

And we'd love to meet all you girls, you tuna fans.

Come out and be sure it's scary to sign everything.

Yeah, I mean it's the private parts, how it's turned level.

That's what we want.

So you want women to be showing their breasts?

We want mid 90s degradation, just big stupid boobs and stupid behavior.

I want early boob jab boobs.

You know, one looks like a bowl and the other one looks like.

The other one staring off like one of Cosby's eyes.

Cosby, what about him?

We lost him, huh?

That was tough for me because people don't know, you know, Gil Fysan is, I took my ex-wife's name.

Yes.

His married name is Fysan.

For any Fysan?

Where any Fysan was my wife's name.

Yes.

What's your real name, actual name?

Cosby.

Gil Cosby is your name?

Yeah.

And so we were getting letters when all this came, you know, when these innuendos came out and that's what they are.

They, we got, well I'll get to that in a moment in case anyone's interested.

I don't know.

We would get letters, you know, open house, real estate and we, you know, that was to Gil Cosby.

The US Postal Service.

Absolutely.

Regular mail, just regular mail.

And I love it.

Old school, brother.

You see that movie, The Postman?

No.

Oh, with Kevin Kessner.

And we lost him.

We lost Kevin this year.

We have.

But that's the upside of anger.

As I said, it is a memorial that I planned in Gil Canton.

Right.

It's amazing.

He was a real baby boomer.

It's interesting when you watch something like the Oscars or the Emmys, when you see all these people and you go, oh, that person died too?

That person, that's what this is like for me because I didn't.

And they tell you to hold your applause, but there's really no need because the good ones are at the end and the beginnings is a bunch of people from the 50s that he's behind the scenes jerks.

I don't give a rats about.

But the upside of all this is that Mickey Rooney died.

Yeah.

That's good.

That was a relief.

Yeah.

Boy, because that was uncomfortable for a while.

He was going to hurt somebody.

He had a little gun, you know.

He had a little duffel bag with a little gun.

Someone was telling me he was on the Conan O'Brien show and he's talking about how five of his ex-wives were murdered.

And Conan O'Brien brought that up and he said, oh, yeah, murdered.

That's a weird thing to say.

You know, for even him, we can remember the good times.

Even if he was a pissy little shrimp.

It's hard out there.

No talent, tap dancing, little shrimp.

Yeah.

The good, it's good for the Enquirer though, a Mickey Rooney death because they were running that Michael Land and went into the ground for years.

Yeah, boy, that was fun.

The Enquirer has a certain few individuals they feel comfortable reporting on.

You Michael Land and Zimikki Rooney see a dick clucks.

Remember when he grew out that hair because he didn't want to cut it like Samson?

Oh, and that's where all of his power derided.

Michael Land and how did he die?

Too much hair.

Too much hair?

That's the thing.

He strangled his own brain.

That's how Samson got right?

Yeah, absolutely.

Absolutely.

Yeah.

Samson L. Jackson.

Is that why Moby is constantly shaving his head, do you think?

Absolutely.

And that's why Moby will live forever.

Yep.

Do you know that at Moby, if you look at him, we like to call him Enime because he looks like an amoeba with those little tadpole eyes.

A lot of people don't know Moby is an immortal and it's been alive for thousands of years.

He just got popular recently.

It's the tea, sister.

It's that sweet iced tea he makes.

It was the worst thing that he ever did getting popular because now all eyes are on him.

He is very, he is pretty white hot right now.

So he probably wants to turn that knob down.

He's very white.

He's also.

Yeah, yeah, he's also white.

All right.

What a jerk.

I ran into him, I'd whip his CD at him.

I don't know once he did.

We're just angry because we see him down.

I have play.

We saw him down at the Lower East Side when he had a tea shop and we went in there and we said, where's Mr. T?

And then he threw us out.

Really physically?

Yeah.

You said guys, I don't have time for this.

I said, you, Stooge, I got cash me sweaters older than you that I could buy and sell.

I had to sell my sweaters.

So I'm so sorry to hear about that.

You seem very cold.

You're shaking a little.

You know, that's actually my hands, you know, a big stones from the bottom of the ocean.

And he's a bad circulation.

And he's, you know, George Sinki-Gling is actually going to be telling this story at the moth, which is just in his closet.

You know, it's a bunch of more.

He's just telling you how to do it.

And I tell them a non-written story.

And not a written story with a poorly, you know, I would actually finalize then think.

You were going to get back to Bill Cosby.

You were saying, what's going on with this?

Well, you know, it's tough.

It's tough stuff.

You know, because we were saying, I guess that just leaves the only other show.

I get, yeah, who knew that family matters with age better?

At the time you look at it and you go, this is the crappy one between the two.

And you know why I'm comparing them.

What about something like seventh heaven too, the legacy of that?

Well, that guy's luckiest day.

It was when the Cosby stuff, Stephen Collins.

Stephen Collins, yeah.

That was like, he was Gary Condit and Cosby was 9-11.

Why is Schmutz right off the windshield?

No one cares about him anymore.

No one cares what he did.

Who knows what he did.

And we could find that, I guess.

One might argue that Cosby was doing this allegedly with grown ass women.

And you know, so Stephen Collins is worse.

You know that Stephen Collins is not Harper Collins.

Oh, sorry.

Never mind.

Not the book publisher, never mind.

Stephen's a friend.

I should say that now.

You should get Stephen's a friend.

Where did you eat Stephen?

We had a WB pitch and we kept the parking pass.

Okay.

So we'd go every day and we'd lean under one car.

And he would come out and we'd, you know, yeah.

Yeah.

Any indication back then that he had these percolons?

What I was up to?

No one knew.

No one still knows that I'm the Riverside Park stranger.

What?

I go jogging.

Excuse me.

I go jogging.

Okay.

Not hunting.

Okay.

I thought you misspoke.

I misspoke.

Yeah.

Okay.

Just now.

So am I not murderers?

No, you guys are not murderers.

You want to go on record this?

I absolutely do.

Okay.

You want to go?

You want to go on record this?

I absolutely do.

Okay.

You want to go?

You want to go on record this?

Okay.

You want to go on record this?

I absolutely do.

Okay.

I'm going to go on record this?

I'm going to be at the improv outside trying to talk to comedians.

Okay, tell me more.

You're in front of that beautiful mural.

Oh, shy conditioned L.A.

Wait, you painted it?

I absolutely did.

Oh, I love the like this one.

I know.

Thank you.

Freehand.

People kept handing me pencils.

I said no tracing.

And she's sinking overhead just and he got the thickest brush he could.

So, he would have a lot of trouble with detail.

For this, you haven't been to L.A.

You've got to go there.

I've got to go to the improv in Milrose because there's a portrait.

A beautiful mural that makes comics feel good with the show.

Hey, we're not those monsters.

You'll feel good about it.

Anyone portrayed feels horrible.

How they've been portrayed and everyone who's not on the wall is furious.

And it's great.

All the greats are there.

Plus a dolphin holding a microphone wearing sunglasses.

The symbol of laughs.

It's like a dream.

You guys are big comedy fans.

We are big comedy fans.

We love comedy.

We lost so many comedians.

I can't believe it.

Terry Bradshaw died in 2014.

Oh, the funniest.

He was in that movie.

Yep.

Leaving home with your parents.

Oh, so good.

I thought he was the, he wasn't the dog in Marley and me.

He might have been.

We don't, we'll never know now.

That's the point.

He died before he could tell us.

We lost Kevin Neeland.

Oh, no.

Yeah.

A dear friend of this show.

And you know, to see all those ads on TV now.

Oh, the haunted Ron's ads.

It's too hard.

But you know what?

He's making his laugh from the grave.

Every day.

He's making God laugh.

Why the psychs dead?

Dead.

God must be laughing so hard right now.

All these greats gotta make God laugh.

I killed all these fucking idiots.

Oh.

I'm the world's worst mass murderer.

He's probably constantly cackling.

Yeah.

He's in control of all the things.

Did you guys read that Robin Williams, Billy Crystal thing that he wrote about a little play?

He wrote about how Robin Williams is putting on his performance up there in heaven.

No.

You gotta check it out.

Oh, we haven't read a word of Billy's in years.

I'd love to.

It's one that you guys would really be.

It sounds really cool and I really want to read it.

You know, there's a certain type of person that's never not cool.

And God.

You know who the coolest comedian still is?

Oh.

It's Bill Crystal.

Bill?

I mean this guy.

This guy.

He turns in on lights up a screen.

He can take little smiles.

I like when he tells a joke.

And then he smiles at the audience like, yeah, I know that was funny.

Oh, it's my favorite.

Why couldn't it have been 1400 Sundays?

We said that already.

We did a matinee once.

We did actually get 1400 ones because we did a matinee of it.

Came back in fake badge.

We have investigations.

Technically one.

And we went in and three and a half shows.

Yeah.

We did 1400.

We did a pre-show and I got to say this Scott, every show was exactly the same.

Yeah.

Was it?

And that's the mark of a professional when they know what works and what doesn't work.

And he got annoyed, is interesting.

With my candy wrappers, the same look each time.

Yeah.

Which is kind of a could you please?

But I love all my little suckers.

What do you like?

I have hundreds of little suckers in very dense, yeah, very dense cellophane.

Well, because he gets in this small ones.

The key is if you get a small one, they last shorter.

So you need to be more than more.

You need more of them.

Yeah.

You get all these C's lollipops.

Do you think candy companies could come out with wrappers that don't make noise when you open them?

Like, like, not Velcro because that would make noise.

Yeah, in that way it's like Ziploc.

Like, wait, it's the wrapper that doesn't make noise.

Yeah.

That's the show.

I don't know what show you guys.

It's a wrapy that doesn't make noise.

It's a mute hip-hop artist.

Okay.

Like the old man in Arrested Development, Tennessee, that old man that stood in the background, he never spoke.

And he goes...

He's doing the candies.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, good.

We've hit on it.

You know what show?

I mean, do we want to talk about this or do we want to talk about this?

Do we talk about this?

We can talk about it, certainly.

We're all talking about wrapping candy and toilet paper, right?

I think so.

Because if we are, I think we're in.

You're in?

Well, I want to talk...

I want to talk bathroom and not humor.

I want to talk about...

For the folks out there, people on the Gil Fysons starting in, you know, another Korea, a little bit.

What?

You know, I got a lot of homemade remedies.

Okay.

You know, like for ailments?

Well, for everything.

You know, I've been pastraming my toothpaste.

Mm-hmm.

What's that mean?

It's smoked toothpaste.

So you spice it and smoke it.

You spice it, you smoke it.

You're cured.

Yeah, exactly.

You curated toothpaste and then it's got nice little things that get stuck in your teeth.

Okay, that seems to be...

And then I'm opposite of what toothpaste is meant to do, which is clean.

Exactly.

It's Malcolm, where was his name again?

Malcolm in the middle.

When then was the other one, who was the political activist who's also a...

I think you're thinking Malcolm X.

Malcolm X?

Malcolm X was a movie.

Malcolm X.

So the sequel to Malcolm IX?

Yes.

Which I never saw.

Speak.

I saw Malcolm X. I said, what the hell happened to this guy in one through nine?

Okay.

That he's got this much of a chip on his show.

Number one, four.

Ah, yes.

Yes.

Too much tuna, of course.

Too much tuna.

Fantastic.

Well, we have to take a break.

When we come back, we're going to be counting down 14 and 13 in the next segment.

No, sorry, 13 and 12.

I misnumbered them on my email, so that's why this is not going right.

We're going to be hearing episodes 13 and 12 in the next segment.

Did you misnumber them all the way through?

No, just in this episode.

Okay.

So I'm going to have a lot of trouble, but when you hear us on Thursday, I'm going to be locked in.

All right, let's go to a break.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang, we are back here.

We have Paul F. Tompkins on the ones and twos.

I'm only on the twos today.

Oh, really?

Yes.

What happened to the ones?

Well, it's a long story.

Do you have time?

We got another butt time.

Okay.

Wait a minute.

We have to actually count down our comedy bang bang.

Are you sure you don't talk to the story begins?

I woke up.

Wait, when?

I woke up this morning.

Oh, this morning.

Okay, I might have time.

Because this is relatively early in the morning.

Yes.

If you just recount in real time, by the way, it'll just be about three hours.

I woke up this morning.

Okay.

I might have landed for a little bit.

Just surf my iPad to see what's going on in the news.

Maybe play a little Plants vs. Zombies.

Who wins?

The zombies win every single time.

If they win, we all lose.

What is it?

Yeah, that's right.

If they win, we all lose.

The perfect tagline tagline.

If they win, we all lose.

Whoever wins.

God, what's up with my referenceometer today?

I may be intentionally getting some wrong, but not that one.

It's hard to tell though, isn't it?

It is.

It's hard to tell for you.

Am I an idiot at this point where I just can't remember anything?

Are you being willfully ignorant?

Or I think a lot of times I can't actually come up with it, so I say a thing that it might be.

I just blurred out the thing that it might be.

Like a placeholder.

Knowing it's wrong.

Yes.

Someone will rush in with the correct thing.

Yes.

Anyway, I took a shower and accidentally struck the number one from the numbers.

What?

There's no more number one anymore.

How are we going to count this down?

I don't know.

It's going to be anticlimactic because we're going to get to two and then that's going to be it.

It's just going to hard cut out.

Yeah.

Oh my goodness.

All right.

Well, keep listening.

Now I want that to happen so badly.

Keep listening.

Just put number one online.

All right.

We do have to get back to our countdown.

I know.

And let's get to it.

This is episode number.

Your number 13.

Number one.

Three.

All right.

Number 13.

And okay.

The last number 14 came from January 12th.

Fuck.

Number 13 is coming from January 5th.

Not one week before.

That's before.

It is before.

Yes.

We're time traveling a little bit.

So it can go that way.

Yes.

We're not going to have to go that way.

Ben Schwartz is on and we have several nicknames for him that he hates.

I think he pretends to him.

That's right.

He likes it.

We talk about his show House of Lies, which I always get it confused with House of Pies.

People send him pictures of House of Pies continuously on Twitter, which he complains about.

I think he loves it.

We'll hear a little bit about that.

Of course, when Ben and I get together, we love to sing together as do you and I.

I think it's a new character, but all of his characters are kind of the same at this point.

He confuses them too.

At one point, I think he came on as one character and thought it was a different one.

This is a new character, but very similar to other ones.

Uncle Stoney, a druggie from the 60s, I believe.

He drops by to talk about his life.

He's a little bit of just me and Ben, and then we'll do a time jump to when Uncle Stoney comes on.

So here we are.

This is your number 14.

Number one, three.

We have two great guests.

It is tradition to have these guys on in the first episode of the year.

I believe it's been a tradition to have Ben on in the first episode of the year for now three, four years.

At least, by the way, at least.

Yeah, every year I've done House of Lies, which premieres this Sunday on show.

It's final season.

It's not a wrap-in-it-up.

By the way, you said the name right.

When you said the name was?

You said the name.

I was last.

We don't even have to talk about it then.

So House of Lies, 10 p.m.

I think we're probably up against the Golden Globes.

10 p.m.

Showtime, Pytown M.D.

By the way, you got the network, right?

Which means that you probably think I'm on HBO.

Wait, you're not on HBO?

Oh, I am on HBO.

Oh, okay.

You got the network right for the first time ever.

What was in this show?

You have Taren Tower from Iron Man.

No, that's Don Cheetall.

Keep going.

Let's see you the other two.

You have Dak Shepherd.

You have his wife, Kristen Bell.

His wife.

And then you have a bunch of no names, and you.

Me and Josh Lawson.

Josh Lawson.

What's in no name?

That's so neat.

Did you say coleslaw?

No.

Who did you say?

Who's on the show?

Josh Lawson.

Oh, okay.

That's weird.

Benny Schwoz.

Hey!

Hey, Benny, bang, bang into your mouth.

Hey, Benny, bang, bang.

You guys know that's a result?

Into your mouth.

You know you want to...

Everybody wants to listen to a skirt.

Everybody wants to...

Into your fucking mouth.

Bang, bang.

Into your mouth.

I got it.

You know what?

We can't talk about that.

When we do a changeover from Reggie to whoever the new person will be, I gotta have him record.

Exactly that.

That'll be the new...

Can I ask you a Reggie question or not on the air?

Ask me on the air and I'll answer off the air.

Is that true?

I don't know.

What are you gonna ask?

So I just heard that he's gonna be the music guy for the late late show.

Yes, the later, later, later.

So does that mean that he can't do comedy bang bang into your mouth?

He...

He's gonna comedy bang bang into your mouth.

Into your mouth.

You know you want to...

Everybody wants to listen to a skirt.

Everybody wants to...

Awwww.

Bang, bang.

Into your mouth.

You gotta bang bang into your mouth.

Everybody wants to listen to a skirt.

Everybody wants to...

This is interminable at this point.

Um, and that comes out on Sunday.

The final episode, you're wrapping up all of the threads.

Nope, that's all the plot threads.

Nope, nope, nope.

But I will say this.

This is a if you watch the show.

If you don't watch the show, give this season a shot.

God bless you.

Nope, don't say...

Nope, we won't be able to...

Yeah, I haven't got a hay penny.

This is a very big season for me, my character.

It's gonna do a lot of dramatic stuff which is really cool.

Ooh!

Give us some of your dramatic acting.

Uh, okay, give me a scenario.

Okay, so you're there at House of Pies and they're all out of pie.

Okay, House of Lies and maybe where the consult goes poorly.

They're all out of lies, though?

Okay, sure, this is what it is.

What do you want, honey?

Oh, God.

Oh, I'm...

Welcome to House of Pies.

No, can I stop?

Can I excuse me?

You're unbreak.

Go ahead, take your break.

I'm not...

Okay, honey, thank you, honey.

Okay, I'm taking over.

Hey, what do you want to root a big pie?

You want to bust a green pie?

Uh, cut.

Cut a pie do you want?

Cut.

Cut a pie do you want?

I find root a big pie.

Can I have a root of it?

You what?

Big hunk, a man.

Okay.

You big hunkin' big dicked monster, you.

Showtime.

Brace yourself.

You big dicked monster.

Why don't you just jump over this counter and take me to the pie?

Let's take anything big dicked.

I'm not even saying I'm a work producer.

You have a refill on your coffee.

I'm fine.

Can I say some lines, cause...

We're all out of pies!

What am I supposed to order?

You...

Sausage-filled maniac.

What?

Sausage-filled maniac?

Oh, I want you.

Oh, God.

Alright, I'll have a root of a bag of pie.

We're all out, I told ya.

So what do you...

What do you mean, you're not working in addition to the opposite of your dick not working?

And seen.

So you'll see stuff like that.

The craziest thing I did when I was high?

Yeah, like the highest you ever got, what'd you do?

Uh, I put...

I put my bird in a freezer.

Oh, wow.

Was he already dead?

Or what?

No, he froze to death.

Oh, I'm a...

Oh, dude, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

You wanna put some tissues in your mouth?

Yeah, what kind of bird did you have?

I had a cock-a-till.

A cock-a-till?

Yeah, a cock-a-till.

You died?

Yeah, I used to say you had a cock till days.

You know, like a long little bird dick.

You had a cock-till days?

Yeah, a cock till days?

What do you mean, four days?

Cock-a-till days.

Did you also admit that that didn't make sense?

I did, I didn't like it at first, but then someone said, I think if you put four in there, it'll make it better and I did, didn't you?

But I thought, yeah, I put the bird cage in the freezer.

I thought it was my frozen...

It was a hot day.

I thought it was...

You thought you would air-condition the cage, I'm sure.

And I wanted to put away my frozen white castle burgers that I buy at 7-11.

I have a question.

I don't know if this is you.

There was a stony in the paper that he froze a series of different animals by mistake.

Was that you?

I read this paper.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It was the Sacramento Bee.

The Sacramento Bee?

B-E-A.

Yeah, did you...

Different from the real Sacramento Bee?

Yeah, totally different.

The B-A-E?

Yeah.

The Bay.

Come get it, babe!

Beyonce spelled a totally different way, but her paper is spelled B-E-A.

That's Beyonce.

Beyonce.

It all makes sense.

Can you sing a one Beyonce song right now?

Yeah.

You got...

Put it on the corner.

Put all the stuff on the corner.

Nope.

I have one.

Go.

What do you got?

Got Sony, do you sing?

Far the single ladies.

Oh, you go.

Far the single ladies.

Dude, dude, dude, dude.

Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

So I put my bird in a freezer.

Wait, so you were trying to freeze your white castle burgers?

I am.

I got so dabbed up that I thought my burgers were the bird and the bird were the burgers.

Yeah.

Oh, no.

And, uh...

So the bird was in the freezer and the entire cage, and then you hung up with like a shopping bag of white castle frozen burgers where the burgers were.

I talked, yeah, I was talking to it and hanging out and feeding this bag of burgers.

And what's even weirder is that at midnight, I woke up and I'm like, oh man, I want to have some burgers so I went and got the bird and ate it.

Oh, no.

Oh, bones and all?

Oh, yeah.

I mean, I was high.

We cut off our noses the perfect time.

You were super high.

Yeah.

Can you give us another way to say, oh no, I want to see if we do it again.

Say something terrible.

Okay.

I lost half my foot on a train track in Arlington Heights, Illinois.

Oh, no!

Oh!

Oh, shit.

True story.

And I have a wooden toe.

I have a wooden toe and I keep, it's like a little dugout.

I keep weed in there.

Oh, wow.

Nice.

I told my toe splits up and inside I have like the weed and you could smoke it from the toe.

Oh, wow, cool, man.

That's actually pretty cool.

Yeah.

That's the coolest thing maybe.

We don't need our toes.

Do we really need our toes for anything?

I don't think so.

As far as I know, nothing's different for you, not having a toe, right?

Well, I can no longer long jump.

I used to long jump for a while.

Oh, I didn't know that.

Turns out you really need your toes to just spring up, you know?

Oh, wow.

I had no idea.

I didn't think about that.

So I'm not out.

No, I'm no longer eligible for the representing United States and Olympics.

So I just, you're an Olympian.

Uh-huh.

Yeah, man.

A lot of us do smoke.

Yeah, someone just didn't, what's his name?

Michael Phelps.

Do you want?

Do you want to?

No, because when you smoke bowls and drive around LA, it's cool.

Oh, okay.

I didn't know that.

It's like doesn't affect you the same way.

Yeah, when you smoke, like when you're high, you can drive, right?

It's not like being drunk.

You drive better because you're like, whoa.

That's something we should be sharing on the podcast.

That's how I feel is like when you're drunk and you're driving, it's like you're like, oh, you drive better because you're like, I don't want to be stopped by the podcast.

No, let's not say these things on the podcast.

There's a lot of young listeners.

I get a lot of young people kind of saying they heard the CBB.

But it's true though, when I used to drink, but I would see four lanes of traffic.

You'd be like, I would just close one of my eyes and drive that way.

We really worked out well.

Yeah.

You should be an Olympian.

You used to fly helicopters.

You told me in the lobby?

Yeah.

In the same black hawk down.

Wait, in the movie Blackbird?

Or in the movie Blackbird?

Yeah, I crashed it.

I crashed it down.

Oh, that was your job.

Everybody stay in the room.

No, well, they thought we got shot down, but in the actuality, I was trying to reach my, I was trying to get my bowl and Black Hawk went down.

Oh, wow.

Bang, bang, into your mouth.

Well, no, now you were telling me, Uncle Stoney, though, you have a brand new project that you're really excited about.

I cannot wait to hear about it.

You know, and it drops tomorrow, so I really want to hear about this.

So, oh, yeah.

Yeah.

You're talking about, you're talking about laser food of the gods.

Laser food of the gods.

What is that?

I've never heard of it.

Well, we're going to watch this 1974 film, Food of the Gods, where it's H.G. Wells, you know, where he turns.

H.G. Wells, the writer?

H.G. Wells wrote a movie.

Or H.G. Wells, the movie company.

He wrote the book, and then they made it a movie with, and then it rats, they eat this stuff and they get big, and everything gets big.

So it's like chicken eats this stuff, and it's like, ah, it's like in the second floor window looking in at a girl changing her top.

We got it.

And then we have laser lights, like, you know, like in tune with the language and the dialogue.

And not the background music.

No, just the dialogue.

And most of the animals, when they get big, they just look through apartments and naked women changing.

Who knew that that's what animals wanted to do so badly?

Yeah, what they did was they used, they put, they put rats, like regular rats in top of like a Barbie house.

Oh, that's how they'd save money that way.

Oh, so they didn't actually grow the rats.

Because that would have been too expensive.

I don't want to ruin it for you, but yeah, they didn't.

Oh, no.

Well, coming out tomorrow, we can check it out.

So that's, comes out tomorrow, where can people see this?

In every one of the major cities in the US you were telling me?

Yes.

Yeah.

Date, Ohio.

You sing, is there a favorite song?

Tucson, Arizona.

Do you have a favorite song to sing?

Eugene, Oregon.

Oh, wow, all those places.

Yeah.

Yeah, the biggest towns.

Wow.

Those three.

Arizona.

Zizix, California.

Wow.

I love that sound.

CZYXX.

Zizix, New Mexico.

But, you know, more than the laser food of the gods, you were telling me you have something really exciting.

You're really excited about it.

Oh, funnier than that.

Even better, that's coming out on Wednesday.

Yeah.

We'd infuse tampons.

Oh.

We'd infuse.

This isn't a bad idea.

Yeah.

Okay.

You give it a nice, heavy indica and it's sort of heavy flow.

It's heavy flow.

For the woman's body through their mucus membranes.

Oh, wow.

That would go so quick because there's so much blood.

It's very quick.

So when they're suffering the trauma of their period, they put in one of these tampons.

Uh-huh.

Uncle Stoney's SNL tampons.

Why is it SNL?

I just think that's a funny show.

I like those guys.

Oh, we were just talking about it.

Yeah.

The package is going to have all the guys from Debbie Downer in it.

Wow.

Breaking.

So, yeah.

I know they're not wearing distinguishable costumes normally.

They're just like people in suits and dresses.

But you'll know who they are.

You'll know.

You'll know by the way they're sitting.

OK, great.

You can talk around the table.

They sit.

It's in the right of table.

Breaking.

And the one looks very much like Lindsay Lohan.

Oh, OK.

It's pretty cool.

And these tampons, they come 46 in the box.

46 with a weird set of arms to put in one every minute.

What?

One every minute.

You put one in every minute.

And then you take out one every minute?

For 46 minutes.

No, he's supposed to have forces just like the guy who can fit all the cigarettes in his mouth.

He's supposed to have a line of 46 tampons going from your vaginal passage to all of them too.

And we guarantee that you will no longer suffer any of the pain or the discomfort of a period after 46 minutes.

Wow.

Oh my gosh.

Yeah.

How much does it cost?

Surely it's expensive.

No.

Oh, how much?

$16 a pimp on.

Wait, so 46 of them though, I mean, that's a lot of money.

You're talking about 700.

About 800.

Yeah, about 800 dollars.

Well, listen, you guys, I don't know what a period feels like and I don't want to pretend to know, but I guess it's not good.

And so.

If you can switch places with a woman, which woman?

A which woman, but B would you?

I would.

Wow.

Which woman still?

Joy Behar.

Joy, but why joy?

Because she has a great sense of humor.

She's funny.

She gets it.

She does get it.

She has her own show now.

Is that the only reason?

She has a good sense of humor and she gets it.

That's, that would mean what else?

I mean, she's great.

When you find someone to love, that's what you're looking for.

I think I would, if I could change places with anyone, I would change places with someone really good looking because that way I could see what that was like.

No, she is good looking though.

Yeah, we weren't trying to shit a good bit.

But she's, you know what I mean?

Like maybe a young hot model or something.

So I could be like.

Like who?

But then if you're that girl, would you be into yourself?

Maybe.

I don't know.

Do I have the same brain or do I?

That's the thing.

I don't know if you're going to have to be in a hospital.

I'm a big fan of the show.

Oh, cool.

You ever listen to solo balla?

Nope.

I heard that there was a character on the other day, a clump tissue car.

I put it in a computer and it's very safe.

Thank you, everybody.

No paper files of this.

Thank you, dude.

You need more.

Balla tracks?

I need a lot more balla tracks.

All right, let me write that script.

You've never done drugs.

Is balla tracks not drugs?

I mean, it's a prescription drug, but not if you're a beautist.

Can I snort it?

Is that something you can snort?

It's a cream.

You can snort anything.

Balla tracks is a cream.

I'll take it.

You can snort a cream.

It can be in cream form.

What happens if can I put, can it make me super, do you have any things that I could put on my body that'll make me super power, super human?

Yes.

Oh, dear.

Wow.

What are these noises lately?

It's track 15.

Oh, track 15 is here.

Well, that's all we wanted to know.

All right, later.

Take the piece of hate.

Yeah.

All right.

Clear holidays.

You know what you're trying to do?

No, too late.

Too late.

It's already January.

You piece of shit.

I want a bang, bang.

Into your mouth.

Number one, three.

Oh, yes.

Well, so good.

So good.

A little bang, bang.

Into your mouth.

You know you want a bang, bang.

All right.

You've had enough of that listening to the clips.

All right.

Let's get to, let's.

Did I say it was number 14 last time?

Because it was number 13.

See, this is already catching up on me.

Oh, man.

How we're going down to what?

11 on this?

We're going down to 11.

Up to 11.

We're going down to 11.

All right.

Let's get to number 12.

Number one, two.

All right.

This is your number 12.

Let, we're jumping ahead in time a little bit to May 18, episode 351.

From January to May?

That's right.

Oh.

This is, we were breaking off another half-hundo episode 351.

And this is an episode.

You're counting half-hundos now?

Yeah, it's interesting.

Okay.

All right.

So, in this one, we're going to get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's get to the next one.

All right.

Let's drop to the ground.

My mouth is foaming.

I had a little tiny seizure.

Now, if we had come up with some sort of interesting catchphrase in that, that it had been titled, maybe people would know what it was, but this episode was so popular, it transcended the somewhat generic title of CBB the movie.

Right.

This is an episode starring the guys from Hollywood Handbook, which is a very funny podcast.

One of my favorite shows, so funny.

Now, I first met them.

I just heard they were, you see me guys, they wanted a show on the network and they wanted to do, it was, their show started out as something called the reality show show because they love reality shows, especially the MTV Challenge.

Yes.

And I met them at a coffee bean by my old place and they pitched me the show and I didn't really, I heard they were really funny, but I didn't get a sense of it necessarily.

Oh, they're terrible in conversation.

Not funny.

I'm not saying that.

I'm just saying it.

I'm saying it.

They're the worst.

I have great conversations with them.

Really?

Yeah.

Oh, no, thank you.

But I didn't get a sense of what their sense of humor was.

I was just like, oh, I hear they're funny and they want to do a reality show.

Let's do it.

They stopped doing that show and they started doing this show, which has become just one of the more interesting shows on the earwolf network.

Just a wildly funny show that has rabid fans.

And I knew I wanted to have them on the show because their show wasn't getting the love that it sort of needed to get.

It was one of the tinier shows on the network and everyone was talking about how it was the most fun show and so funny.

Interesting, you say not the love that it deserved, but the love it needed to get.

Interesting business perspective.

Well, it's not, I mean, needed to get in the sense of like, no, it deserves it.

Another way to phrase it deserves that love.

It's on the bubble.

Oh, we're not canceling it.

And in fact, we don't need to anymore because it's doing great.

So what happened?

You're welcome.

I don't know what you did, but okay, great.

I started having Hayes and Sean on to read ads with me because I was so fun.

I would be, for some reason I would be either recording on a Saturday, they record their show on Saturdays.

I would be recording on Saturday or I would come in and have to do ads and they were always around.

I was like, guys, come in and do these ads with me.

These ads turned into like sometimes like 10 minute long.

They're so long.

They're really long.

But they were so funny and I feel like if you're an advertiser, you're getting 10 minutes.

Of course.

You know, so they were doing these ads with me and I was putting them into several episodes, trying to prime the pump for like, okay, now you got and you know these guys rhythms.

So when they're on the episode, rhythms, you know, they're rhythms.

They're rhythms.

Hear them now.

They're rhythms.

Now that they're on the show, you kind of like know what they do and you're ready for it.

And that's kind of what happened here.

I finally had them on the real show.

We kept saying their advertisements were an audition to be on Comedy Bang if they were funny enough.

And of course they were way funnier than me on it.

And so this episode has a lot of fans.

I mean, no, Scott, of course you were hilarious.

You know, Scott was staring at me pointedly.

Yeah.

After he said they were wearing you into a skull.

That's exactly what I was doing.

I may also have been looking at my notes here.

He kicked me out of the table.

That's true.

And I'll do it over the table as you don't straighten up.

So they have a lot of fans, a lot of rabbit fans and they all voted for this and some of their people who, you know, this is just a really great episode.

So what they do on, I asked them what they wanted to do on Comedy Bang Bang that was sort of inspired by their show.

And a lot of times on their show on Hollywood Handbook, they do these improvised film scripts on their show.

They say they're reading a film script that they wrote and then basically they just improvise it there on the spot.

So that's what this is.

They said that they wanted to quote, read, unquote, a script that they wrote about the Earwolf Studios. So this is us just improvising a movie script on the spot they brought in a couple of really funny improvisers, Ben Rogers and Haley Huntley.

They're both in this as well.

So this is what we're going to hear.

This is your number 12 on the countdown.

Number one, two.

So you, you, you've made a Comedy Bang Bang movie script.

We made the Comedy Bang Bang movie script.

Just got the one.

And what started as sort of a fun project, I think has become a very real money making possibility for everyone in this room.

Yes.

And we should introduce the other people in this room who are sort of part of our management shingle.

Yes.

Funny comedy managers.

Funny comedy managers, obviously part of Wolf Cool Productions, which is our sort of internal.

Oh, you guys have your own shingle from Wolf Pop and Earwolf?

Yes.

The Wolf Cool and that is a subsidiary of Calvin and Hobbes, which we just think is so good.

And so...

I don't know it, but I've seen the back of pickup trucks.

So I'm aware of them.

And peeing on Steelers.

Yeah.

Those are actually illegal.

Those are unauthorized.

Sorry, but Bill Watterson doesn't care.

Okay, if that's true, it's very true.

It's notorious Black Loose, so...

Oh, Watterson.

Big fan of Calvin and Hobbes.

Yes.

Was that his dad?

No.

Okay.

Next time you're reading Calvin and Hobbes.

You think of Susie Durkins?

No, no, no, no.

Next time you're reading it.

Yeah.

Look up slightly to the right.

Okay, that's Pogo.

No, no, no, you've gone too far.

Okay, hang on.

I just want to read Pogo real fast.

Okay, go ahead.

We'll wait.

I did not like that.

Yeah.

I could have warned you.

It was sad.

Look a little bit down from Pogo in between Calvin and Hobbes and Pogo in the blank space.

Okay.

You see some letters?

Where Maurer Fillmore used to be before.

You see some letters there.

It was there.

You know, not the ones that say Calvin and Hobbes, but look to the right of those.

Foxtrot.

No, you've gone too far again.

Okay.

You need to go back to the left.

Now I'm reading the news.

Okay, you know what?

This may be a hopeless case.

Anyway, what do you guys have?

You have a script, you have a full-length feature script.

We have a script.

To help us read it, we have a couple of our company players sort of our repertoire.

We have Bang Rodman this year.

Professional actor, Bang Rodman, aka Ben Rodgers, aka Rad.

Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to perform.

You helped us out with the live show that we did.

You read an ad for us that we got in trouble for.

Got arrested.

Yeah.

Sorry about that.

I'll do that again.

But Bang Rodgers.

Bang Rodgers.

That's right.

Yeah.

Okay.

Welcome to the show, Bang.

Hey, thanks for having me.

I'm very excited.

Okay, I was going to say, are you excited to be?

But you are excited.

He covered it.

I'm excited.

I'm here.

And thank you.

Okay.

So...

And you can introduce, because I don't want to.

It's weird for Hayes to introduce his own daughter, but Hayes's daughter is here from Spring Break and she's spending some time with him, which is so nice.

It's Haley.

Who?

What's your stage name?

Halle.

Okay.

Your stage name is Halle Huntley, but your real name is Haley Davenport.

People say, Haley, like...

Sounds like Hayes.

She took Davenport or did she take Brooks last name?

She took Brooks last name.

So, Haley, she healed.

Oh, okay.

Now, when you say it's weird for you to introduce your own daughter, have you never introduced your daughter to anyone?

She's supposed to introduce me.

It's cute.

Imagine how cute, you know, not anymore.

She's a little old for it now.

How old of a daughter are you?

I'm 20.

Okay.

And so, when she's like a cute little kid, like she walks in front of me and says, oh, I like you to...

Pre-presenting.

This is my dad, you know, and you had that speech impediment implant that we need you so cute.

And now you don't have it anymore.

I don't.

I talk just like everybody else now.

So let's get to this script.

What is happening with this?

Well, hopefully it's being made.

Well, let's just read it.

Let's just launch into it.

Everybody gets your copies in and read it.

All right.

And you've divvied up parts, I assume?

Well, you're going to play...

I'm going to play...

Scott.

Very good.

And we... yes, we've divvied up the other parts.

Okay, here we go.

It'll all make sense.

I'll do it.

Okay, but put my spin on it.

But read them as written.

Well, we're going to be doing notes after the scene, so we'll see what happens.

Okay, great.

So, interior, the earwulf big studio lights up on a bustling studio space.

People running by with papers and talking on the phone.

It's a lot...

It's a hustle and bustle, but everybody's having a good time.

The new intern, Trappson, enters with a confused look.

I hope I'm in the right spot.

I wrote my bike here.

He's approached by a young but have a job producer who is cute but hot, Nancy.

Oh, you're in the right place.

Trust me, it always feels weird at first.

The vibe between them is immediate.

They look in each other's eyes and have a sensation of knowing each other forever.

Why did he write, oh, in the middle of that sentence?

It's very weird.

It's got to feel natural, conversational.

Yeah, but in the stage directions?

No, no, no.

That's the best place to put stuff like that.

Okay, this is like if Mamet wrote stage directions.

Is that your real eye color?

Yeah, they're purple.

I know it's unusual.

I got it from my mom.

Thanks for noticing.

Most people don't.

You look like you like jazz.

The music or the dance?

Both.

You nailed me.

You guys, you got to get in here for the big pitch meeting.

Already?

Everyone rushes in to Scott's office.

It's got a lot of animal heads on the wall.

They looked like they were really happy before they were, you know.

Scott is sitting at the front of the room.

He's got to look on his face like he just ate something that was by accident.

Oh, God.

Oh.

Ah.

Do I say all those words, right?

By the way, hey, so.

Yes, yes, that's exactly.

They were all phonetics.

Yes.

I really wondered, but that was fantastic.

Yes, that was good.

Okay, thanks.

It's me, Engineer Cody.

Remember you promised if I had a real great idea you'd let me have a podcast?

Engineer Cody, not ringing any bells.

I'm one of the engineers.

I'm the one who's a fucking problem.

Oh, yes.

I've read about you on the message boards.

That's right.

Anyway, I think I did have a good idea, but I forgot it.

Engineer Cody sits on the floor and begins trying to eat his own butt.

Well, Engineer Cody, maybe we can jog this memory out of you.

Trying is actually a bad word.

He's doing it very successfully.

What is it?

I never noticed how long your tongue is before.

That's incredible.

To reach all the way back there without the usage of a spoon.

To me, that's just normal tongue stuff, man.

Sure, well, we all have our weird idiosyncrasities.

Hey, don't have a cow, dude.

All right, all right.

No need to quote classic TV lines to me.

Is everyone wrong?

OK, well, you're still in the realm of The Simpsons.

You could move on to other shows like Night Court.

Sorry, I'm late for the meeting.

This is my first day as an intern.

My goodness, look at your eyes.

Yeah, they're purple.

Hey, thanks for noticing.

Hey, do you like jazz?

At the music or the dance?

The vibe between them is a medium.

The person.

Yeah, I love jazz.

The person, of course.

Yeah, the DJ.

Traps and immediately forgets about the person that he met earlier.

Doesn't he remember her name?

Much like the narrator.

Hey, I love your.

I love your.

Who are you talking to, Cody?

I just saw this new intern come in.

I love your eyes.

They're the same colors, the jerseys for the Utah jazz.

Yeah, that's my favorite basketball team.

That's crazy.

The vibe between Cody and his own bud is immediate.

I just got to finish something up in here.

Something called a bell pepper.

Cody, I wish he would do that in the other room.

Put it in here about a month ago to pickle.

Man, these animals look like they were happy once.

Yeah, they were.

They really, really were.

So you guys ready for the big pitch meeting?

Everyone gathers around for the big pitch meeting.

They're all excited to see who Scott is going to pick for the first pitch.

All right.

Look at this.

Who should I pick for the pitch?

Well, on the one hand, I like your eyes.

On the other hand, you're a woman.

Hmm.

This is a tough choice.

Eyes woman, eyes woman.

He's looking at the wrong people as he says these things.

Wait a minute.

I'm just looking at Cody.

Can't blame you.

Cowabunga.

Tell you what, whoever speaks first can have the first pitch.

Oh, here's that food somebody ordered.

Sorry.

Somebody ordered some Thai food?

A very Americanized Thai man enters the room.

Yeah, I've noticed that you have some sort of gruff New York accent for a Thai person.

Oh, yeah.

I'm from Thailand.

But you know, I learned English.

You learned to speak by watching repeats of NYPD blue.

That's right.

Yeah.

I watched a lot of NYPD blue sip wits and whatnot.

Yep.

Boy, I remember that episode when he had to show his butt.

Oh, do I?

That's my screen saver.

Wait, what are you saving your screen from?

So it doesn't freeze and stuff.

Oh, OK.

Do you want to be?

I don't know if this is weird to say, but best friends.

Yeah.

I kind of feel like the vibe between you and I is immediate.

I do too.

Do you feel like jazz?

OK, are we talking the type of music, the dance, the basketball team, or the person?

Oh, I'm talking about the dog.

Oh, the dog.

I forgot about him.

Yeah.

No.

Oh, you don't?

All right.

Well, here's the food.

Wait a minute.

There's no dog in this food is there.

I better move my car.

Just a word on improvisation.

The stuff about Asian people eating dogs that you improvise there.

Well, that's the one thing that I really wanted to do.

Not really are OK.

I'm sorry, but I had to put my own spin on it for one line, at least.

That is definitely a movie.

You really threw me for a movie?

It's a movie, though.

So you have to admit that.

Yes.

It's content.

I just want to say that at my school, Temecula College for the Arts.

We do a sort of different kind of improv, where really, like, anything goes.

Oh, I'd love to do some of that.

That's not really when you say that to him.

He gets into stuff about the stuff that different races eat.

I mean, that's kind of I'm excited about this.

I mean, what could Italian people eat?

You know?

Oh, gosh.

I shudder to think what you think they eat.

I mean, probably salads with like a layer of dressing underneath a plate.

That's what a nasty stare type.

While we're out, I didn't realize I was going to be reading some of these lines with your daughter.

I feel like the relationship's a little inappropriate.

And it gets extremely sexually explicit.

Do we want to jump to that scene?

I was going to say we should probably be going to hear some of that scene.

Go to that scene.

What pages have this is page 77?

This.

Yeah.

Yes.

This is the first act break.

Yes.

This is a long script page.

It's 326 pages.

And we have not finished it, finished it, but we're close.

OK.

Let's cut to page 77.

Yeah.

You said this was seen as appropriate, because my daughter.

I said it was inappropriate.

I said I didn't.

Let's judge that for ourselves once we hear it.

OK.

Yeah.

I'm saying don't worry about it.

OK.

Yes.

Don't worry about it.

All right.

Here we go.

And action?

Is that what you did?

Yes.

Director said.

Interior bedroom.

Nancy walks into the bedroom, taking all her curves with her.

Trabson looks her up and down.

Sorry the power's out.

Well, it looks like he got enough candles to get us pie.

Ha ha.

I've got enough candles, but it's still not warm enough.

Maybe we can turn up the heat.

Let me ask my roommate if she'll leave.

No.

Tell her to stick around.

I'd really be more comfortable leaving.

Do this for me.

OK.

I do like all your forks.

Hey, come on, honey.

Let's get out of here.

These guys are being squeezed.

They want us to leave.

Let's go watch some NYPD Blu-ray runs.

What do you say?

Oh.

Oh, hey.

Why do I love you so much?

You're such a fucking dunce.

Oh, well, I could kick to the head by a mule.

Yeah, I know it.

I love you for it.

You always were hanging around mules.

That's what I like in a woman.

The very Americanized Ethiopian man who was speaking takes his girlfriend out of the room.

And it's time for traps and in my daughter to do it.

My daughter, this robes.

Oh, you look beautiful.

It looks like no man's ever touched you before.

The two of them hit each other like the crash test dubby car in a brick wall.

I want you to call me dad.

I can't call you that.

She does it.

Dad.

Listen.

Sometimes back at the studio, I feel like no one listens to me.

I feel like I'm the producer.

I'm the head of everything.

But I'll sit quiet for an entire pitch meeting.

I'll just play with my phone and pretend like I've got something to do here.

Take off my bra.

But I don't.

I'm just scared to talk.

Oh, God, your body feels so good.

Thank you.

You should be more confident.

And speak up for yourself.

Call me Hayes.

Nope.

She does it.

Hayes.

Dad Hayes.

Number one, two.

All right, number 12.

You know, that was a funny episode.

Yeah.

I laughed a lot during it.

Yeah, LOL.

I did.

I laughed a lot.

I actually did.

I fell out a number of times.

I remember I listened to this in the car.

I was working somewhere and I had an hour.

I can somewhere.

Oh, I don't know.

What?

I really am curious as to how in your brain that became a approximate amount of syllables has been a while.

I'm working somewhere.

No.

I had kind of deridum.

No.

Had deridum on.

It didn't.

I think there's something wrong with your brain.

It had deridum.

Speaking of deridum.

We'll get to that story about you driving around in the car by yourself.

No, I listened to my, it was like a, like some miserable drive that I had to make early in the morning and it was a long drive and I listened to that the whole way and it turned my day around.

Oh, that's so nice to hear.

And that's why we do this show.

I think it's to turn people's day.

And that's why people do comedy in general, I think, you know, to turn, to turn those frowns upside down.

That's really why I got into the business is the frown upside down biz.

Oh, I'm trying to fill a hole inside me.

Oh, okay.

Really?

And it never can happen.

Oh, it never will.

Never get filled.

What was that caused by?

Oh, let's see.

Teachers like Dr. Horn.

Dr. Horn, tough, but fair.

Very million.

I'm not backing him on that one.

Botulism.

That was beautiful.

Ciffelous.

HIV positive.

Ciffelous is actually a pretty word.

It is.

You know what else is?

Chlamydia.

Oh, never getting rid of my darling Chlamydia.

We have to go to a speaking in darling Chlamydia.

We need to go to a break.

Let's go to a break.

When we come back, we will have your number 11 and Chlamydia.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back here.

Scott augerman here with fall of Tomkins and we're just blazing through it.

Although it doesn't feel like...

Are you going to do that?

I don't know.

Every single thing I say.

What?

How did we establish?

I just want to nip it in a bud before you get started.

You know we can do it.

Yeah, because you're going to run this into the ground.

Oh, I'm going to run it into the ground.

I'm going to run it into the ground.

Hey!

Who's this guy?

I don't know where he came from.

I'm going to run it into the ground.

Who character?

No.

That will destroy my throat.

Oh my God.

I mean, Jarl's already.

Jarl's is actually easier to do.

By the way, was classic Jarl's was its inception.

It was this year, right?

Yeah.

We're not hearing any classic Jarl's clips on the countdown.

I'm afraid to say.

Even though he's appeared in some of our top 14 episodes, we're just not hearing those clips.

Are there no bonus?

We're not doing any...

We will have a few episodes down the line.

We're going to have something.

But we're not doing bonus.

This took up so much.

What?

Not doing what?

Bonus.

B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b bonus.

Okay.

This is the last episode whose clip we're going to play in this episode of Our Best ofs.

This is your number 11.

Number 11.

Now, this comes from, again, we're going all the way back to very early in the calendar year.

This is February 16.

Back to February.

This is right around Valentine's Day.

What episode do you think this is?

So romantic.

This is episode 335.

335.

This is probably the St. Valentine's Day massacre comedy style.

No.

Of course, this is our special Valentine's Day episode.

This is the wedding of Gillian Gary.

So I was pretty close.

This was, of course, our beloved PFT here.

That's right.

It was in this episode as well as Gillian Jacobs and musician Colin Hay.

That's right.

Dropped by and participated.

This was a very fun episode for me.

I love playing with Gillian.

She's hilarious and she's so much fun.

People would know her from Communitech.

Communitech.

Anything, Incredible Bird Wunderstone.

And the upcoming Love.

That's right on Netflix.

On Netflix.

With Paul Rust.

That's right.

Rust.

It's a very fun year.

Can I tell you a quick story about Paul Rust?

Paul Rust.

Yes.

My wife, Janie, and our friend Cynthia, Cynthia had a party at her home.

And Janie was there and so was Paul's wife to be Leslie.

He was getting married soon.

It was very soon.

And Leslie said to Janie and Cynthia, oh, you guys should come to our wedding.

And then we were not invited to the wedding.

She said you should just come.

Just come on.

Just drop in.

Well, no, we don't want to like, you know, whatever, crash your wedding and, you know, whatever.

We know like, because everybody had been married.

It's like, we know that that's...

She was having a good time with you at this party and was like, yeah.

I wasn't there.

I wasn't even there.

This is just Janie.

J.J.

And J.A.

Bruce.

J.J.

Jonah Janie.

My wife.

So Leslie's saying, no, please come.

It would make me so happy if I looked up and I saw you guys there.

Please just come to the wedding.

And so Janie tells me this.

Like we're going to go.

And I'm like, are you sure about this?

I was weird.

Yes.

And I really...

I said, was she drunk when she said this?

Like, no, she doesn't drink.

She was totally sober.

She was very insistent.

Like you guys should come to the wedding.

I'm like, I don't know about this.

And so it's like a month later and the wedding is happening.

And so they're very excited.

Janie and Cynthia and Cynthia has been miked.

Like, let's do this.

We're going to crash this wedding.

Okay, guys, okay, let's do it.

So get all dressed up, meet at Mike and Cynthia's and then on the way from our house to Mike and Cynthia's house, five minute drive, like dread is mounting.

This is...

We should not be in the sweats.

We should not do this.

Albert Brooks and Brock Gantam.

Exactly.

I'm sitting on my jacket.

And so I get into their house and I say, I'm really having second thoughts about this, about doing this.

And like, come on, it's going to be fine.

It's going to be fine.

So we'll leave.

Have anyone sent any kind of email reminder of like, hey, we're still going to crash your wedding or...

Yeah, those guys had.

Okay.

No, no, no, no, no.

Not to Leslie.

No, no, no, no, no, no at all.

Just, just, just to us.

Who each other.

Like, like, wait to do this.

Oh boy.

And so they say, come on, it'll be fine.

We'll leave right after the ceremony.

So we're not like taking up any food or drink or whatever at the reception.

Like, okay.

There's always leftover food and drink though.

No, I know.

But it's...

Most of the time.

But if you have been married and you've thrown a wedding...

And I pray that you are.

And well, if you've invited more than 10 people, you know that it's like, it's a pain, you know?

Right.

And it's like, it's not so much that it's pain, but it's...

Dang, you're impression.

Pain's.

Fuck.

I swear to God, I was like, what is that?

So we, so they, they convinced me, so we go to the wedding.

And my, ideally what would have happened was we would get there one minute before it started.

Right.

Watch the ceremony and then leave immediately.

So we get there.

Leave the hall-shaped hole in the wall.

Exactly.

And you can see by the outline of my body, I did not take any food or drinks.

Open it one.

Is that a hot tub?

That's just just as weird hand.

Hot tub.

Yeah, they had a carnival people wedding.

So we get there and of course the wedding is not starting on time because no wedding starts on time.

Either except for one.

Who?

Sarah Altman.

Oh, that's right.

We pulled up as they were walking out.

Nerd poker cast member Sarah Gizardo.

Oh my goodness.

Her wedding started exactly on time.

Exactly on time.

And we got there at, say it started at six, we got there at 617 and they were bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, they were coming out of the...

Oh my gosh.

I was the efficient of that wedding.

I saw you guys.

And we, we got there and they're walking out and, and we're like going to the wedding.

Going up to the valet and cool up, it's like drive.

I'm like, what?

She's like, Florida mister.

All of a sudden I'm the wheel man.

And so I had to drive around the block and she's like, just keep driving around the block until like they go back in and they can't see that we got there late.

And they took pictures for like a hour and there and cool up.

It's just like, there's no way around it.

We're going to have to and she would, she's the environment.

Yeah, who cares?

Yeah.

So we get to the, we get to the, the, the place where the wedding is going to be and it's, I'm, I'm so so proud of this.

Undisclosed location.

We don't want any of you fucking weirdos going around sniffing the seats.

That's right.

Oh.

So we get there and of course because I know Paul, I don't know him well enough to be invited to his wedding but I know him and so.

And do you know, do you have any idea if he knows that you were asked to crush?

No, I have no idea.

I have no idea.

I'm not going to touch with the relationship at all.

Poor little situation.

So I get there and of course there's a million people that I know from just around, you know, and I feel so self-conscious because I feel like everyone's looking at me like, I don't think Paul knew weirdly, weirdly, you and I never crossed paths during it.

I kept going, where's Paul?

Maybe were you avoiding me because you didn't want to?

No, I just, I saw you, I saw you walk in.

I was like, Oh, I got to make my way over to Paul and I never got over to you.

Here's why because we could not stay still.

We kept moving around, we're just trying to, like nervous energy.

Yes, because, and now this was great.

Now they're all nervous too.

Like as soon as we got there, we're like, Yeah, guys, this was a terrible idea.

We're all very uncomfortable.

And so the, at the one point the wedding is getting ready to start and so we go kind of sit in the back and then, and usher somebody, you know, from their party comes over and says, Oh no, we want people to sit closer like, no, we get up and we go hide.

Now I had shot stuff there in this venue.

Yeah, I shot the sheriff there.

What about the deputy?

No, the dev, that was a different show.

Oh, okay.

And so I said, let's, you shot, she's the sheriff there.

Yeah.

Look at that.

Much about this.

Many times.

I'll give you that one.

So, I say, let's go down.

There's a bar downstairs.

Let's go check out the bar because I used to film, speak easy there.

Oh, really?

So not when I did it, but, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, interesting.

The bulk of speakeasy we shot at this, at this barn.

So we went downstairs and we're like kind of looking around and then we emerge from this little room and we see Neil Campbell, best man, Neil Campbell, who gives me a look of absolutely surprise of like, I don't think so.

Really?

I don't know.

I can't judge it.

I'll check in with him about it.

Then we turn around and when Neil like looks past us and we turn around, we see the groom.

Paul Russ, but like, and then there's no, and he looks at us so briefly.

And in my mind, it was a look of the fuck are you doing here?

You didn't want to be a distraction, I'm sure.

I'm sure he has way more things.

Way more like, you know, he's not even seeing a face.

No, no, he's just like, am I going to cry?

Am I going to cry?

He's out of his mind.

Yeah.

So, but it felt, it felt horrible.

It felt horrible.

So, so the wedding begins.

And so we're sitting.

We're like, et cetera, et cetera.

Paul enters with his mom and dad.

Very sweet.

They kiss him and leave him at the altar.

Leslie enters with her family.

My wife and I stand up.

Right.

No one else in the entirety of this.

And by the way, I saw you tweet about how, you know, you're the only one who knows that it's polite to stand when the bride comes in.

That was the second wedding I'd been to that week in neither.

That's crazy.

No one did.

It was us and one other person.

I think it's a new thing or something where people don't stand.

But how does everyone know?

I don't know.

I think no one wants to do it.

Maybe.

And so if no one is going to.

But I also think that there are certain people who lead that kind of thing.

Like, is this one of these ones where we stand?

Guess who it was not?

It was not us.

Right.

When you were in the back.

No one, we were in the back.

If you had been in the front of everyone who else, someone who was closer to the front, who was the only other person that stood, who was Michael's show Walter, was the only person.

And he, he and my wife, he and my wife made.

And we were in the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back.

And so I think that that's what we're going to do.

And so I think that's what we're going to do.

We're going to do it.

And so I think that's what we're going to do.

That no one did and there was no expected because it was an unconventional wedding.

I think I was in that headspace.

Right.

I was like, you don't.

But I've been to this.

This is the year that I went to, I believe nine weddings or something like that.

Wow.

And at every other one, we all stood.

So I don't know what happened in the brain for that particular week where people are just like, fuck this.

I don't, and I've been the efficient at a handful of weddings now.

I've never had to tell people and now please stand for the bride.

People just did it.

I think there is usually, if they want it, there's usually someone who initiates as in, hey, we're all saying, but you know what is worse?

And I made sure I was the efficient at a wedding this year myself.

What is worse is I've been to a wedding recently where no one said please be seated and people had to stand for a lot of the wedding.

It was so they didn't get like, okay, when they're set, you can just sit down.

Well, yeah, yeah, because the person just launched into the thing the minute like the bride went there and everyone standing and no one wants to interrupt.

It was really bad.

Now, very quickly, as the efficient at a wedding, have you dealt with like wedding planners and stuff like that?

There was a little bit of that where I was trying, I never met the wedding planner until maybe an hour before the wedding.

And I was trying to kind of give them the feeling that they were, they were really stressed out about what I was going to do.

Oh, yes.

And I was trying to give them a feeling of like, I'm a professional.

I think I am going to be fine at this.

But I think they're used to dealing with, you know, regulars, non-coms.

Yes, of course.

All the time.

Probably.

People who aren't used to speaking in public and they were trying to like drill in me what was happening.

But I can get my blocking, you know, and like remember it right away.

Every time I've done it, I've been treated like garbage.

Yes.

I would.

I don't want to say that in case someone knows who the per I don't think anyone.

I'll say it to my friends.

They treat me like garbage.

It's long enough now.

Right.

I think the most recent one was two years ago.

They treat you like an idiot.

They treat you like you're a bus boy or something like the hired help or whatever.

Exactly.

Yeah.

Hey, here's how it is.

Stupid.

Where are you going to stand?

You know where you're going to stand?

Yeah.

One guy the last time I did it, a guy on the staff like grabbed my upper arm to move me somewhere and I said, Hey, what are you doing?

I'm sorry.

He's a top kid.

He realized.

Well, no, he didn't know I know I was.

No, no, no, he just realized I crossed a line.

But you know, stress is so high of like, you know, they're hired to make sure it goes well and they can't have some jerk just going, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You know, so I understand a little bit.

But I feel like there should be some indication that I'm going to be that way before you treat me that way.

Like if I'm showing up and I'm clearly a competent person.

True, but I also think that we're used to getting direction.

Being an actor sometimes is like that.

It's almost like the army where you like take direction and you just like you're able to memorize that stuff really well.

Right.

And they say, okay, you're going to go up at this point.

You're going to make a right.

You're going to move the mic at this point.

I was just like, ah, I just checked through it in my mind and said, okay, right.

But I think most people are not used to taking blocking or taking direction like that.

That could be true.

But let me say, do you think that could be true?

Do you think it's that?

You don't get to do it on your own.

You son of a bitch.

It's based on something on the other person says.

How do you account?

I'm going to say technicality.

No, there we go.

All right.

We do have to go to our next episode.

This technicality.

No, down, go over.

Here we go.

This is episode 12.

This is the wedding.

Sorry.

11.

Shit.

This is the wedding of Gillian Gary.

All right.

Let me give a little backstory here.

Gillian Jacobs agreed to be on the podcast.

A few years back, I don't think anyone.

I don't think any of us knew her necessarily.

I think we had done thrilling adventure hour together, but I didn't speak to her.

So I reached out to- I had met her before the podcast.

I think you would met her.

But I had been on thrilling adventure and was like, oh, she was really funny.

And so I reached out to the thrilling adventure guys.

And I said, hey, do you think the two bends?

And I said, do you think she would be into doing my podcast?

And they said, yeah, probably I don't need to go through every fucking step of this story.

It seems likely that she would.

Jesus.

Knowing her for as little as we do, she seems game for stuff.

But she came and she did an episode.

Did you do the first episode she did?

I don't recall.

I think that I did.

I think that you did.

Yeah.

And she was really funny.

You guys were really funny together.

And she became a regular.

And she hadn't been on in a year when we had done this episode.

And the year previous, usually when she's on, she does it with your character, Gary Marshall.

He was the creator of Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley and director of Pretty Woman.

And we've set up, it all came about very organically, we set up a romance between she and Gary Marshall, where she is sort of playing a gold digging version of herself.

Which is her idea.

Her idea.

And also, not that far from her actual personality, I've come to find out.

Maybe I shouldn't be saying that.

Maybe something.

And so we had set up a year previous that she and Gary Marshall would get married on.

What are you doing?

I'm trying to.

What are you doing?

I'm trying to look her up on the Earwolf website so I can see what her first episode was.

Okay, very good.

And I accidentally with my thumb, I hit play.

Yeah.

I bet you did.

Turn around.

By the way, turn the ringers off.

My ringers off.

Okay, we're going to get to an episode where it was not.

So forgive me for...

Fair enough.

I've been listening to that episode three times.

No, all right Scott, you win this round.

So we promised that Gillie, as we call her and Gary, would get married on Valentine's Day.

A little backstory, Gary's wife Barbara, he put her in suspended animation so it is legal for Gary to get married again.

Gillian mentioned several times in these clips that she has a recent multi-hyphenate because she just directed a documentary.

That's right.

And one other thing I should mention is Gary Marshall we set up on the previous episode is banished back to his own dimension.

If he ever answers a question regarding what the chicks will do when they see Greece lightning.

This sounds crazy if this is your first episode listening to the show, but this is years and years in the making of the improv has gotten very complicated.

Now, we also by the way, Len Wiseman, the director of the underworld films is also Gary Marshall's friend because they're both directors and all directors know each other.

That's right.

Len Wiseman of course, he's a good looking guy in his 40s from a Cupertino County.

He went to Cupertino High and that's all there is.

Oh, and he loves sex parties.

Gillian's first episode, August 2011, she was on with Andy Daly and it was the Andy Callahan RN.

Oh, okay.

And then, and so then after that, you guys were on together.

She had such a good time in that one.

Then yes, then words with friends.

Yep, that sounds right.

Was I think I was on that one?

Yeah, I believe so.

And that's where we talked about playing words with friends where she bailed on a couple of games with me.

Look, it's been four years.

She's been doing a lot of episodes for four years.

She's great in it.

Then all the rest are with me.

Well, we clicked with something.

We clicked with you guys.

We've also had a lot of great musical guests on the podcast this year.

And this is the only episode I believe that's actually featuring one of them in the countdown.

We've had stars and peaches, the American football, American football, Diane Coffey.

They've all given great musical performances and a lot of musical people who like Paul Banks from Interpol and people like that who didn't even perform.

They just, and the Eagles of Death Metal were on a few weeks back and they didn't perform.

They're just hanging out and having fun.

So in this episode, Colin Hay was in town.

I had never met Colin Hay.

I'd been to see him perform several times before.

Colin Hay laid off minute work.

Yes.

Who can it be now?

Why it's Colin Hay?

He was in town promoting a new solo record and we heard that he could do the show.

And I thought, I think that'll be a really interesting episode if he is on with the two of you doing this marriage.

He agreed a lot of times the musical guests don't stick around all that long.

They'll do their performances.

Some stick around the entire show.

This and Colin stuck around the entire show doing the songs live and participating, which is great when you get this.

It's totally game.

Very funny guy.

Yeah.

And when we heard before the episode started what songs he wanted to do, he let us know what the titles were and what the themes of them were.

We decided to try to incorporate those, geez did I just burp into the microphone, those musical themes.

I don't know.

Did you?

Yeah, we tried to incorporate the themes into the plot line of the episode.

So we said, oh, okay, that song is talking about this.

Let's put it at this point in the plot.

We like gave it a little bit of a plot line, very bare bones.

And we kind of did that as we went along.

As we went along.

Yeah.

So this is Paul F Tonkin's in a tour de force.

He's doing not only Gary Marshall, but he's doing Len Weisman.

And the Reverend Parsoni also comes in right before this.

And he's going to perform the wedding.

That's another character you do.

And another character you do comes in and interrupts.

So let's hear that this is the wedding of Gillian Gary, your number 11.

Number one.

All right.

So Reverend Parsoni, you are ready and able to perform this ceremony.

Yes, not willing, but I'm going to do it.

No, thanks.

That's all we need.

All right.

And would you like, would you care for any music?

That's up to the couple.

Would you like a processional?

Yes, please, please, please.

Oh, baby, I like your ways and your money and your days and your face and your nose and your eyes and your toes.

Oh, Gary, I like the way you do the things that you do.

And I give you the right pills.

Oh, Gary, I like licking your nose.

I like seeing your toes all over the air.

Oh, Gary, I love you so much.

I have.

I love Gary.

I love Gary so much.

I got a new will made already.

You give me all your money.

I got your kids to agree to the new will.

I got your money.

I love you.

Oh, Gary, I love you.

She loves Gary.

Gary, I love you.

OK, this is long.

All right, is that enough?

Gary, do you want to sing a song to me?

I mean, I feel a little vulnerable right now.

Gary, do you want to sing a song?

I had playing on it, but I'll guess I'm here.

Colin, can you give him some music?

I think Gary wants to sing a song.

Give me a backing track, I guess.

Yeah.

Hey, Killian.

Yeah.

I'm going to marry you today.

Hey, I'm going to marry you today.

I'm going to marry you today.

Yeah.

And then we're going to go away on a honeymoon in Haiti or a nice tropical island.

So let's get it over with.

All right.

Gravity truly is the soul of wit.

If everyone's done improv singing, then let's please proceed with the ceremony.

All right, how would you like to proceed?

What can I do to help?

OK, there's nothing.

One of those.

So the show, there's got to be something I can do.

It's a wedding.

I don't want to do.

I've never officially been a poster.

We're someone in the congregation, so what can I do?

Usually that's all decided to put on one.

All right.

Weddings are not usually a volunteer affair, as it's usually planned out.

And it's all taken care of.

But I'd love to do something.

Hey, why don't you sit there and shut up?

There's two things for you to do.

All right.

All right, go ahead.

Do you ever please join hands?

All right.

Us too, or Colin and I?

I don't care.

You can.

Again, this is this many interfere with your guitar playing.

Not the way this is supposed to go.

All right.

Daily beloved.

We are god.

Did you say, gilly beloved?

Why?

What do you want?

I don't understand why you're doing what you're doing.

Sorry, it's just I'm on.

I'm on.

Have you ever done this?

Is it a wedding before?

No.

I've never been hosting a show during a wedding.

All right, maybe just push the microphone away.

All right, here we go.

Daily beloved.

I'm assuming we are gathered here in the presence of almighty god who looks down at us all.

What's that?

Gods.

Polytheism.

Yes, thank you, Alpagan.

Why did you ask me to do this?

Service.

I just figured.

Why did you go with the online fella?

I mean, really, it's six or one half a dozen of the other.

You know what?

Lentil shut up.

Fair enough, but that got me a little hot.

Sorry, go on.

I just like you.

We're gathered here in the sight of the one true god who makes no mistake in looking down and doesn't like any of this business at all and doesn't like the human race in general and just waiting for any opportunity to smash us all into dust from which we came.

You're gathered here to witness the marriage of this young lady to this nearly dead old man.

I would like to start with prayer.

Come, canine, follow my ghostly voice.

Come, canine, attend me.

I love that poem.

I wrote it.

Now then marriage is a sacred trust not entered into lightly.

Certainly not on a podcast, but here we are!

You know the church needs new faucets, so you do what you gotta do.

Please step forward, do you have vows that you would like to read?

Or are we gonna go traditional?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I've got my vows already.

Alright, the bride will go first.

Thank you.

Dear Gary.

How are ya?

I'm swell.

So excited that our wedding day is finally here.

Just make sure you sign that new will I had drawn up by Star Jones Esquire.

Gonna get all your money, your children are okay with it.

I unplugged Barbara from the suspended animation machine.

She's slowly dying right now, but I think you're secretly okay with that.

The first time I saw you I thought, gosh, that guy must have a lot of bucks.

TV in the 70s and 80s sure was profitable.

I love you so much.

Your hair is so pretty.

And you love me so good.

Yours truly, Gelly.

Alright, well, don't quite know what to do here because if the wife is unplugged from the suspended animation machine, she's not technically in suspended animation.

She's dying, she's dying.

Alright, but dying's not the same as dead.

You might want to have some, but I'm not trying to tell you business.

I want to plug it back in.

Maybe that's something I can do.

Okay Scott, go plug Barbara back in.

There you go, son.

Thank you very much.

I'll help you.

Now is the groom.

Oh, they need your help.

Yes, I'll hold the plug for you.

If the groom would like to proceed with his vows.

Okay.

Gelly, the first time I saw you, I thought that's the girl from TV.

Soon after that, we embarked on a whirlwind romance of getting married, getting divorced, putting my wife in suspended animation, faking my wife's death, revealing that she was alive, then putting my wife in suspended animation.

This is the first draft.

I meant to go over this.

I printed up the wrong one.

From the second day that I saw you, I realized, ours was a love that could not be avoided.

Much as I tried to do so.

Will you please do me the great honor of marrying me so that I will make you rich after my death?

What?

And you, well, I mean, you're going to share in my wealth while I'm alive.

Of course, I'm not going to like that.

Then you'll have all of it.

Yeah, but you'll have all of it.

But you're like, I get an allowance while you're so alive.

Of course you get an allowance on my old fashioned guys.

As a writer, if I could give you a little punch up.

Oh, sure.

Yeah.

Why don't you do some writing for me?

God knows, I never went anywhere as a writer.

I'll be your writer.

You're just a, you don't think I wrote stuff?

I mean, the Van Dyke show, you ever heard of that?

Who do you think invented the character of Jerry the dentist?

I'm just saying you could say she's super rich when she's dead and rich while she's alive.

Rich while she's alive, super rich.

Okay, what he said.

So here we go off on a great adventure that will last probably a very brief amount of time.

Yes.

I love you.

Oh, it was painful to listen to and I'm glad it's over.

Please take each other's hands once again and you will place the ring on your fingers after repeating after me.

Young lady, you say with this ring, Ivy wed.

With this ring, Ivy wed.

Put it on his finger there.

Not so hard.

You're making marks.

Oh, honey, come on.

It's on there.

You're getting into the webbing.

With this ring, Ivy wed.

Oh, good chime in.

Famous Spider-Man cover.

Oh.

When Spider-Man broke up Doc Ock's wedding to his Aunt May.

What?

All right, pretty girl.

We get it.

You never read it.

Are you telling me that at some point the Spider-Man continuity and May's only living rather than him from the ring?

Yes, very doctor.

And on the cover Spider-Man came in and webbed up the rings and said with this ring, Ivy, did she not realize he was an octopus man?

She did not realize it, I believe.

He kept the...

Or she thought he was sweet.

He kept them because...

That he wasn't a supervillain.

Just a regular old octopus man.

He was a mechanical artist.

I beg your pardon.

It was the reverend who said with this ring, Ivy, and then saw the web on the ring and said, Web?

Oh, he was about to say Web.

Web and then said, yeah.

Okay, let's get to it.

Let's get to it.

I apologize.

Isn't there something you're forgetting?

Don't you usually ask at this point if there's anyone who objects to the wedding?

I do that after the ring part.

Oh, okay.

It's more dramatic.

Okay.

Certainly there will be no one.

Mr. Marshall, please call me Gary.

Gary, place the ring upon a finger and repeat after me.

Yeah.

It's the same thing as before.

With this ring, I thee wed.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Now that you have the truth, one another to each your own.

It is only left for me to ask, is there anyone here who knows any reason why these two should not be joined in a holy matrimony?

And then nobody ever says anything because it's rude.

Sure, of course.

It's too rude to do.

So Colin, you're not going to say anything.

I'm not going to say anything.

I've got a lot of the campaign tonight.

We're not going to say anything.

So we're the only people in this room.

So obviously, I don't...

Stop this wedding.

What?

Who is this man?

I'm not allowed this wedding to continue.

Alan Fick?

That's right.

What are you doing here?

I'll tell you.

Gillian, I love you and I cannot stand by and watch you marry this elderly man rich though he may be.

I'm also very wealthy from my television work and also writing those theme songs.

And your recent show, Conspicuously Thick?

Is that what it is?

Arguably Thick.

It's a reality show that follows me and my wife, right?

Oops.

I forgot that I was married.

You're married.

Now hold on a second.

I've been married several times.

So this is very easy for me to do.

Honest mistake.

Helen, can I interject?

It's something in my own wedding.

Oh, this will be our first interjection, hell-room-at-it.

I have several issues with you, Alan.

One?

Please list them numerically.

Okay, one, you have deluded your wealth through several marriages and divorces.

Gary has only been married once and there has been no divorce.

That's right.

Just to suspend that animation and a fake murder.

His empava hasn't gotten a dime out of him.

Two, I said, Alan, I'd be happy to marry you.

If, if, if you will give me all of your son's money and you said, no.

Well, Robin, of course, has his own career.

His own divorce.

And his own divorce.

So like father, like son, the apple doesn't fall far, so on and so forth.

And that was not my wealth to promise.

A man can only promise his own.

He's your son.

You made him.

You can, you brought him into the world.

You can take him out.

That is true.

A father, of course, is legally allowed to murder his own son, but by the rule of the cosmos.

That's right.

I'm saying because that's his famous joke.

I brought you into this world.

I'll take you out.

But it was an expression before it was a Cosby bid.

He didn't coin that term and now there's an unpleasant Paul over all these proceedings.

True, but he said it on the very first episode of the Cosby show.

Yes, okay.

But.

And on his record.

All right.

Let's stop talking about Bill Cosby because I think it's a bit of a downer at this point.

I don't know.

Well, to each his own.

I'd say this wedding is already been.

Todged enough by my presence.

So why drag Cosby in this?

Please stop seeing his name.

I beg of you.

Sorry.

Dr. William H. Cosby.

Who did it just make it a little better?

What is going on?

Gary just calmed down.

Everything's going to be fun.

Rub is backlit.

I'll give him a little back rub like they do in the theater.

Do I still need to be here?

Yes, because we're getting merry.

We have to say you may kiss the bride in order for this thing to be.

Oh, that's right.

That's what makes it legal.

Yeah.

So I'm willing to marry someone here today.

I don't want to marry Alan Thicke.

Why?

I told you you don't have as much money as Gary.

I've been working long and hard.

Yeah.

Long and hard.

Six years on community and what do you have to show for?

I'm tired, okay.

A horse sweater?

Perhaps a horse sweater.

We don't even know for sure.

Two pairs of sunglasses?

I would like, you know what?

Look, I know I just got here, but perhaps a horse sweater in contention for title.

Thank you Alan for being so conscientious.

Well, it just struck me.

I mean, I have an ear for these things.

Certainly.

Now Gillian, what I do lack the crease-like wealth of a Gary Marshall.

I do have a wonderful ranch and property in Canada.

Canada!

It's beautiful.

You're one of the 50 people who lives there.

That's right.

100, please.

Sorry.

A little insulting.

Many of them named Gord.

You've almost met them all your day?

I've almost met every Gord.

Oh, I thought you had almost met all the other 99 people in Canada.

What's the difference?

I'm sure.

Gillian, what I can promise you is a real life, not a life based on material goods and the shallow pleasures that they bring, but a life of romance and devotion for probably almost 10 years.

Are you still married?

Good.

Yes.

Okay.

Bye.

But Gary is a good married.

We plugged her back in.

That's all good.

Star Jones told me it was fine.

Yeah, unless your wife is in suspended animation.

Oh, she is.

Did I not mention that?

Yes.

Why did you have to throw a wrench into my face?

She fell into our suspended animation machine, which we kept.

We were afraid that there was going to be nuclear apocalypse.

Well, you're not wrong.

We weren't going to see.

Well, yet another reason that it's built for two and certainly you and I could wait out the coming nuclear apocalypse.

But isn't your wife ready in there?

Wait, your wife is just throwing her out of bed.

I mean, you know, there's only room for two.

She doesn't understand.

What's your name?

Alan, I feel like I can best explain this to you in a song.

Okay.

Did you need accompaniment?

Yes.

All right, Colin, do you want to?

I don't do a cappella.

Alan, I love you dearly.

You're my passion.

You're my heart.

You're my sexual partner for life.

Let's just keep it how it was.

We'll keep having sex, but I'm going to marry Gary.

I'm going to marry Gary.

He's got more money than you.

You're just an actor, Alan, and I'm not into you.

I'm a multi-hyphenate now myself, and I don't want to marry just an actor.

You're gross, Alan.

Gary, Gary, Gary.

Gary's got so much money.

I love Gary.

Gary, Gary, I made my heart out of Gary's money.

And now I'm going to see how the world can be.

I'm going to travel to all the country, the number of stuff.

I'm going to eat all the wine.

I'm going to drink all the caviar.

I'm going to wear all the clothes.

I'm going to dance all the dance with.

I'm going to sing all the songs and have a romance with Gary.

Well, that was certainly compelling.

If you don't mind, though, I would like to sing a song of my own.

Ooh!

I'll see if I could change your mind.

Counterpoint.

You know, because you said that I'm just an actor, but you're forgetting that I'm also a songwriter.

A singer-songwriter.

A whole lot.

And a host.

I hosted a show called Animal Crackerhomes.

And Think of the Night.

And Think of the Night, of course.

A singer-songwriter of the Facts of Life theme.

What?

And the different strokes.

That's right.

What?

You know, royalties are, uh, no, uh, small...

I don't know, let's not do it.

Hey, Colin can tell you that much.

Yeah, certainly.

Wait, you wrote those songs?

I wrote different strokes, Facts of Life.

And, Colin, if you wouldn't mind accompanying me, give me something a little bouncy, uh, uh, uh, sitcom-themed me.

Well, there's a way to get married and have UK candy to do.

And that's if you marry me and I marry you, I'm Alan Fick, the end.

Wow, great.

Huh?

One of the shortest ones I've ever heard.

Well, I can only write a theme song like, yeah, chunks.

Any more than that is Gilding the Lily.

It's more Gilding the Gilly.

Maybe that's a good title for this.

Golly.

Lilding the Gilly.

That's truly Gilding the Lily with that.

Let's, okay, Alan, let's, okay, let's resolve this once and for all.

Let's resolve this.

Who do you want to make?

Let's put it to a vote.

Wait, we can hold vote?

Yeah.

Reverend Pursimini can vote too?

Yeah, Persimons can vote.

Okay, so how many of us are there?

Of course you have Gilly, you have myself, you have Colin, you have Gary, and you have Lentil, you have Reverend Pursimini and Alan Fick.

So the seven of us will not be an even vote.

Can they vote for themselves?

Yes.

What if they cannot vote for yourself?

Okay, you cannot vote for yourself.

I feel that that complicated thing.

You cannot vote for yourself.

Okay.

There you go.

Let's go around the room.

Gilly, you'll be last.

Okay.

I'll go first.

I, you know, to be honest, I love the love story between you and Gary.

I think, you know, I got a vote for him.

I vote for Gary.

Great.

One for Gary.

Colin, how do you like to vote?

I think that I was in there from the start with Gary.

I thought that Gary was a fantastic match for Gilly.

Thank you.

It just has a ring to it.

It's a literative.

It's a...

Thank you.

Two.

All right, that's two.

Oh, yeah.

You didn't actually say if that's your vote, though.

Oh, yeah.

Okay, great.

Okay.

Great.

I just wanted to lock you in.

Lentil.

Final Lent.

Yep.

This is difficult because Gary's obviously a friend of mine and I don't want to see him hot broken or hurt.

I also don't want to see him taking advantage of it by a recent multi-hyphenate.

I'm sorry, darling.

You just haven't been in the game that long and you don't know about the road ahead.

It's very difficult.

Take it from a guy who's a little bit older in his 40s.

A little bit.

Just a little bit, but I've been around long enough to know.

So although this is maybe cruel to do, I got a vote for Alan Thicke.

Ah, one for Alan Thicke, you're on the board.

Wow.

This is exciting.

This is a squeaker.

All right.

Thank you, Lynn.

Let's go to...

Well, I'm not really doing it for you.

It's not a vote for you so much as the vote against Gillian.

I'm sorry, Gillian, to say that.

All right.

Let's go to Gary.

Gary, who do you vote for?

Um, okay.

You can't vote for yourself.

You can't vote for myself.

You can vote for anybody?

No, you can only vote for the two contenders.

Oh boy.

All right.

And what's the score right now?

Well, it's two for Gary, yourself, and one for Alan.

Alan, okay.

Let's see here.

If I vote for myself, it puts me over the top.

You cannot vote for yourself.

You can't vote for yourself.

So that's not an option.

Not an option, so I'd like your vote.

All right.

Well, it's a cue for myself.

The only other person I can vote for is Alan, correct.

I gotta go with Alan Thicke.

Congratulations, Alan.

We're tied.

It's a real bon burner.

All right.

Alan, I'm going to go to you for your vote.

All right.

I can't vote for myself.

I can't vote for yourself.

How many votes are there remaining?

There are three votes remaining.

So it's a I vote, then the Reverend.

Then the Reverend Parsimini.

That's right.

And then Gillian.

All right.

Hmm.

I gotta make this count.

Well, you can't vote for yourself.

Right.

All right.

I understand that.

Let's think about this.

I vote for Gary.

Very good.

Gary.

He's called me Mr. Marshall.

Oh, you've angered him.

That's right.

You're Gary privileges how revoked.

But he voted for you.

That doesn't matter.

I don't want man.

Don't want his pity.

I don't want to.

I don't want anything.

I don't know.

I'm past my bedtime.

Why am I still here?

All right.

Reverend, how do you like to vote?

Well, there's three to two in favor of Gary.

This is all of course very disgusting.

I don't usually vote in these matters.

This has never come up.

This is the most unorthodox wedding I've ever performed.

It may make me retire from performing weddings altogether because as much as I don't want to go out on a low note, I also don't want this situation to ever be repeated.

I vote for Alan Thicke.

Alan Thicke, it's a tie.

Well, Gillie, it's going to come down to you and who you want to marry, which I think is the best way to decide who you're going to marry.

Oh, the right thing, honey.

The pressure is so intense.

Gillian.

Can you just give me a brief rundown of the candidates?

No, no, no, I remember that.

Gary Marcell of Alan Thicke.

No, no, no, net worth.

Can we just refriend down?

Alan?

Yes.

How much money do you have?

Do you want me to look up celebrity net worth?

Yes, please.

All right.

Can I get a look at up Scotty?

Do, do, do, look it up.

Scotty.

I have.

And this may sound jogging.

I have $2 million.

Oh, God.

Well, there's a lot of money to have on you.

Let me verify.

Oh, on you.

Yeah, was that not the question?

No, no, no, no, no, you're not worth.

Oh, I do apologize.

Do you know the number eight?

Yes.

Have you ever seen it lying down on its side?

Oh, you cutie.

I've got it, by the way.

All right.

I am Alan Thicke worth.

Now, this is, I don't know, I'm listening on a podcast, a gentleman being asked to say how much money he makes is considered rude in some circles.

But here it is on celebrity net worth.com.

40 million.

All right.

That's strong, very strong.

It's a lot of, it's a lot of money.

And of course, the money keeps coming in because it does it.

Yeah, different strokes and facts of life.

All right.

Gary.

I've looked you up on celebrity net worth.

Oh, my on there.

Yep.

50 million.

Oh.

Very close.

10 million more.

It's pretty close.

Well, closer than I thought.

Now, honey, I want you to remember, although Gary has 10 million more dollars.

He's not long for this world.

Yeah.

He's an irascible old coot.

Got it.

And I don't think he's going to give you a life that you can end up liking.

Whereas Alan, I think is truly devoted to giving you a romantic wonderland that you deserve for some reason.

All right.

Gillian, I'm going to need your answer.

Who do you want to marry?

I would like.

I'm sorry.

I'm just getting emotional.

I would like to marry Gary Marshall.

I will.

Congratulations, Gary.

Thank you, I guess.

Boy, oh boy, this is turned out to be way more of a hassle than I ever dreamed.

Well, Reverend Parsonini, you can, of course, pronounce them mad.

I'll first turn it over.

Before you do that, I have a question for Gary.

What will the chicks do when they see greaslighting?

Oh, you, the chicks will creep.

Scott, I'll come in.

Oh, no.

Scott, I'll come in.

Oh, he was banished to his invention.

I had him in my car.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

Did you do that on purpose?

I kind of did.

You're an curable romantic.

I am.

I love the romance between Alan here and Gillian.

I hope that within the next calendar year that something will blossom between them.

But no, I'm so sorry, Gillian.

May I say something?

Sure.

I know I'm not an invited guest here, but you do have an open door policy and I took advantage of it.

Gillian, I don't expect you to marry me today here on this podcast, but I do hope you'll take some time to think about it.

Take a calendar year and we'll meet here.

Well, meet here next year.

How's that sound?

Yeah.

All right.

Number one, one.

There it was.

That was a fun day.

And I should mention that perhaps a sort, perhaps a horse sweater was not the title of the episode, nor was Gilding the Gilly.

We were pitching those.

Oh, that's right.

There were pitches all throughout.

Yes, we were trying to pitch the episode.

What the episode title would be.

And instead July, by the way, big shout out to July Diaz, who does the recaps and the titles of these, he just decided to call it the wedding of Gilly and Gary.

And this is a case where it worked because we all remember it.

Oh, yeah.

If it had been Gilding the Gilly, maybe people wouldn't have voted for it.

The horse sweater thing, not at all.

People not have remembered that.

Perhaps a horse sweater.

So July, good job on that one.

Well, how about that one that you called out of the podcast that one time July July's recap of the episode was so crazy filled with typos and a sentence that did it.

Did it drunk one night, basically.

Yeah, it was a crazy.

I went and looked it up and it was fucking hilarious.

July does these pretty late at night from what I can tell because I was getting after I even go to bed.

And it was a crazy one recently where it just had run on sentences and typos.

It was like, okay, July, you were drunk with business.

He revised it the next morning.

Well that is the first episode of our best of.

We have not even cracked the top 10 yet.

We're getting to that in our next episode.

This is an amazing Scott.

What I think about how we haven't even cracked the top 10 yet.

Did you perp again?

No, that was a laugh.

I don't know what was going on.

You put your fist up to your lips.

I put my fist up to my chin and I was going, hey, Cam.

But you're not leaning on anything.

Nope.

You're just holding your fist against your cheek.

Hey, Mr. Mike got moxie.

So when we come back, not when we come back because that's the end of this episode, but on Thursday of this week, there will be episode two.

We are going to have the number 10 episode, the number nine, the number eight and the number seven episode of the year.

Lucky number seven.

That's right.

And as late number and align and says seven, says seven in.

As we go out, Paul, thank you for being here.

As we go out, I do want to play.

As you just heard in the previous clip, we were making a lot of references to next year.

Next year, we were going to Gary Marshall is banished for a year in his nine dimension.

So next year, we were going to be next year people and try to get married again.

So we are going to hear Collins performance of the song next year, People, a beautiful acoustic performance here as well.

A little backup, a little backup.

Some friends.

Very nicely asked the three of us to do back.

Or very foolishly.

I think Gilly was not comfortable doing it, but she sounds great.

She's great.

Fine.

She doesn't fine.

I'm downgrading it to fine.

That is it for this episode.

We will see you on Thursday when we crack into your top 10.

Thanks very much.

We'll see you then.

Bye.

Thank you, I and I.

You can't live without hope, the things will change for the better.

You can't live without the dream of someone reading your letter.

We've had dust storms before and spit out the dirt.

We've had droughts before, but none quite like this.

We've had winds that cut up your face all to pieces.

Black blizzards that stripped all the paint off your cup.

Fires like twisters, no sisters of mercy.

They come with no warning, only that sound.

What is roaring drunk and out on the town?

Next year everything will come good.

The rains they will fall and will dance on the hood.

We'll fill up our bellies with plentiful food.

We'll eat the drink and memory.

Yeah next year people will wait and see.

And next year people you and me.

The Henry got hit by lightning twice in the head.

He stood and walked away.

We thought he was dead.

Now he talks funny, says he's wired to the sky.

He walks for miles and miles and no one knows why.

The bankmen they came and wrote things down on paper.

We all went outside and just stood around.

We were glad when they left they brought nothing but a heartache and the seed we had planted it stayed in the ground.

Next year everything will come good.

The rains they will fall and will dance on the hood.

We'll fill up our bellies with plentiful food.

We'll eat the drink and memory.

Yeah next year people will wait and see.

When next year people you and me.

Dry endless plains and we suffer the worst.

How we being punished or are we just cursed.

It's almost ten years and no drop of rain.

Only mocking blue skies bringing more of the same.

Our mother was crying when they sent us to stay with strangers in a town and we both ran away.

Back to the dust and see Henry again.

We're creatures of habit and don't you know.

One day we'll reap what we sow.

Next year everything will come good.

The rains they will fall and will dance on the hood.

We'll fill up our bellies with plentiful food.

We'll eat drink and be merry.

Yeah next year people will wait and see.

When next year people you and me.

Yeah next year people will wait and see.

When next year people you and me.
