year old intern is here anyway so all that and more on today's 2011 your preference really all right thank you Reggie Watts that is the comedy bang bang theme and speaking of hot summer nights it's a hot summer day here and we're here in the studio and we're welcomed or I we're not welcomed but I do want to welcome you're welcome I'll say you're welcome jump in and help me out here well it's Marissa Walkler here you guys may remember me as the comedy death ray how many bang bang now by the way that's your your first duty is to change the name of the show comedy bang bang who came up with that gem comedy bang bang intern my attendance has been spotty let's just put that out there let's talk about this because about a year ago or so you were hired to be my intern yes I wrote you a pen you a letter you immediately jumped on mic yeah I did I put the cans on that's what they call these right yeah they do and you just start talking and we yeah cuz I just felt like this show needed to be revamped you know like that's where I was coming I was coming from a place of what is broken here that I can fix you wanted to reboot the franchise and you know what I found out that is too tall in order for me it was it exhausted me I had a migraine that lasted for like three or four days after my first show I did with you well you did your first show about a year ago then you just showed up out of the blue maybe six seven months later yeah a second you know my stepdad Seth wanted to go to the that shoe warehouse and so I said hey let me stop it and see if these guys are doing a show so I jumped in I only had like 40 minutes he got some trainers and I dropped a little bon-mo on you some of my comedy bon-mos and the last time you're here was with Andy Richter and how was that meeting a big Hollywood star like that I mean he came in like his workout clothes and I was just like what is it you know what I mean like first of all you're surprised that he works out yes that was the number one surprise and no he was really nice it was really nice and I I've tried to Facebook friend him I haven't heard back I'm what he might get on Google Plus I don't know but so yeah that's what he's waiting for he's just waiting for Google Plus probably waiting for that because I wanted him to be a guest on my show that I'm doing I'm gonna I'm gonna do a show it's gonna be a podcast called Womp It Up and you can find it on WompItUp.com backslash backslash Womp Up The Jam yeah so so WompItUp.com was not available you had to do a backslash Womp Up The Jam I understand that let's just talk about who you are though because you're you're my intern you're receiving high school credit for this I still am unsure basically you showed up to the studio one day kind of sold me a bill of goods saying saying that you had been assigned to do the show right because I'm a nice man I just kind of congenially said okay whatever you need and then you grab the cans right I grabbed the cans and I got to work and I then and you got a lot of mail about me right did people write in because I felt like I had a star power that was sort of pretty clear yeah I mean you definitely had something I will say that you had something that the listeners reacted to yeah the X Factor if you will and so yeah well basically basically oh you don't have to yeah you don't have to sometimes I have a body control issue so turn it down on your monitors but basically I did it I had a media class and so like I did you know I was supposed to do this project where I was supposed to come and see you like every week and like do tasks and stuff but I just showed my I just showed my episode as like this is what I did and people were pretty impressed what grade did you receive um I got a C- but that wasn't because of that wasn't I'm already mad at you I swear to God my rage goes from 0 to 10 the moment I walk in here I don't know what I'm already mad because I didn't get a C- because the show of my performance it was because I have a trouble paying attention in class and listening so okay so you got a C- just in the class not on the not on your project yeah exactly what you get on the project I'm gonna say an A- plus I don't know Mike Mike was a long time ago when you were still a freshman yeah yeah exactly so anyway now I'm heading in I'm heading into junior year and that's it that's that's it yeah it's a coming up on the junior year for you and boy it must be an exciting time you're becoming a woman mm-hmm oh by the way if you hear someone grunting I didn't run out mm-hmm there's another guest who I've yet to introduce sorry I feel like I like this guy already this guy's on my side you like him but you know yeah no I can't stand you she's a ball of energy oops okay my voice so people don't hear me let's let's introduce you I normally I would talk to Marissa a little bit more I'm so but that's okay no you want your time no you know it's not about my time everything comes my way eventually really I can learn from him all right let me explain who that voice is you've heard from Marissa want oh boy he has a pain look on his face as if he just got a stomach ache or something but you know him as comedian Todd glass he's here hi that's all I have to offer hi it's good to be here wow you really wanted to interrupt before now you have nothing to say let me let me ask you Marissa are you taking French class yes yes we I should say I feel like there's that and I know you're older than her but I feel like there's there's heat coming from him right Todd felt it I know this guy's been on my jock since like day one hold on 15 that's almost 16 yeah almost 16 but that's one of the reasons I don't come in here very much because I don't want to lead them on it's I what have I ever done to please I'm a happily gives me bedroom eyes across this table give you dead maybe it's more adoring I think he adores you I do I am fond well yeah there's something about you that is she's precocious I know that's a you know they say in radio that opposites are good for you know so she she gets on my nerves I get on her nerves it makes her I think I think opposites are good if it's a genuine opposite not if somebody is told you're gonna be the counter thought so you know when you give her do morning radio and they have the girl it's a lot of times it's a woman whose her job is to be the voice of reason before so boring right so so instead of just if she agrees agreeing but when she really disagrees yeah but so she just disagrees with everything and you want to punch her in her fucking head yeah well let's try it let's how would you like to do it so say Todd you have a radio show and Marissa you're the you're the female co-host how would you top of the water you know whoppin up that would be I would always be like the color carpet there about whoppin up whoppin up okay so Todd you you you start being a radio DJ and we'll see how Marissa does oh okay you know um hold on I I have it I have something I can think of you know I just I wanted to talk about this I have a pet peeve you know when people don't call you back it's driving me nuts yeah that's like the story of my life and I can't do it I can't roleplay sometimes I just go play I mean you're playing a character named Todd glass oh the only difference is is you have a different occupation and not that too dissimilar what you actually do I know cuz I am and you're having trouble with this and I am starting a podcast so maybe this is a sign that I shouldn't do it you need to get to know yourself Todd spend some me time I couldn't do it unless I really did it there's something in my head that gave me a block start over you're trying to think of bits that's what you're trying to do you know what it is I feel like you're probably feeling I'm intimidated because of I I have only been doing this three times this is my third time on the air and I feel like everyone feels like it's been years for me this is too much for you yeah exactly so that don't be it I thought she was gonna argue I thought you she was doing the character like I was gonna say I can't take it when people don't call me back I love it when people don't call me back right that's what I thought and you went and you and then and and I'm great she just agreed with me she did she did what you wanted no she agreed with me that's what I'm saying is you said it made you want to punch people in the face I just want it to be real I don't want that well that was real oh you're right she does you're right all right all right you're right you didn't have to be right about it I didn't want to unleash your anger towards women you are right no there's no anger I don't anger towards anybody I'm an individualist all right well like the Henry Thoreau of comedy Todd do you have any questions for Marissa here yeah 15 years old that's a good age you're enjoying it 15 years old I'm just saying I when I see kids at the mall and they're having fun like to me I really do I think I'm sure they have their problems and there's so much stuff going on at 15 but it looks like they're out of the house and it looks like you're watching kids at the mall you were gonna take it that direction of course I am because I know what you're up to I know what you do you know I know you go to the mall of what you do how dare you you have an illness yeah he's like at the dancing fountain at the grove like jerking it at the corner that's a how do you even know what that means I know what's going on no I just think when that's an age when I seen anyone do that yes no no when I was when I was visiting my great-aunt in New York we were on the subway and a guy part of New York in Queens I go to Queens I have a good time we'll explain that later okay Todd you just walked it up no but a guy took a guy took his wiener out on the subway and you know what he just sort of laid it on somebody's shoulder that's real he was standing she was sitting she was like reading a Harry Potter book or whatever and he just laid it like softly it depends now if somebody did that it depends if they're joking like if they're doing it like to be silly like I asked for a cosign from our engineer by the way on that joke he gave it to me when I go to Queens I have a good time one time I heard a guy in a car with Dave Rath and we I'm with the guy was in the car with Dave Rath though he's in the car next to us and he goes when I go to Queens I have a good time and we thought well it sounded like he's arguing with somebody so we thought maybe it was his somebody else going when we go to Queens you know my aunt's moving into an assisted living so maybe we'll help her move in like I'm not doing that like I like to think it was something going hey you know what when you go to Queens you have a terrible time so we're thinking you know maybe when we go to Queens I go I have a good now listen when I go to Queens I gotta tell you I'm glad you had a good time but when I went to I didn't have such a good time thank you I got mugged at the ATM machine and you know what she would say well I don't know what you are when I go to Queens I have a good I know you have a good time and I'm just saying when I went to Queens I'd rather you not mention it so so time I like an okay time yeah and add to that it brings back horrible memories because that's where my I lost my child and never found her again what yes she does she still goes well I know that happened to you but when I go to Queens I had a good time I once heard someone go you're crude you're rude and nobody likes you I thought yes no I really did I was walking down the street I heard someone say that to somebody you're crude you're rude and nobody likes you nobody likes you the same person is what you're saying Todd yeah sounds like the same person just one sassy black one would walk it around with these bonmos these bonmos want to hear about Subaru oh yeah okay okay now Marissa you you were not here for Todd's last show no you were strangely absent yes several pool parties but Todd the last time you're you're here we had a surprising cliff hanger okay now set up set up the clip here a little bit very quickly I want to be nice because everything's great with Subaru I never had a problem with the car I'm glad when I had a problem with something that happened at Subaru I never said anything bad about the car I want to be fair you're talking about the reaction to the story I want to I want to hear just that the the I had a situation of the story itself I had a situation with Subaru where they were gonna give my mom a car and then because of her credit they weren't able to do it and I thought I'm trying to keep that part sure and anyway so I mentioned it on your show and then I mentioned it on the Adam Carolla show about it was probably my show that made the difference it was your show that made the difference people were tweeting to Subaru uh-huh but the point is to tell the story properly I have to say it what it was because on your show I didn't think to tell people to tweet to Subaru right and I said let's not judge them because great companies make mistakes I actually was on the side of Subaru no you weren't yes I was really yeah I didn't think that your mom deserves you always side of the corporations but so people started tweeting Subaru about a week ago and they called me and it's all great and they're delivering a Subaru it's for a year lease just okay you know giving her a car to drive for a year to my mom next week so I'm totally excited Wow where's road trip yeah right my mom has no idea and it's her 70th birthday so I think it's gonna be awesome very excited Subaru Outback my favorite car yeah happy ending to Subaru so tweet Subaru and say Subaru rocks on behalf of Todd Glass yeah come on help me out here okay that's gonna be my new tag phrase like I'm gonna tell a joke I'm gonna say something like you know I believe in karma that's why I go to the mall and I punch people in the face I go would you do to deserve that Subaru like it's actually not bad no I said no I saw a bird in a shitty neighborhood I thought why would a bird live in a shitty neighborhood Subaru what about your diarrhea joke that's the only go-to joke I have when I'm trying to think of a quick joke it's funny because I've known you for 17 years whenever I'm trying to think of like a quick joke that needs a da na na na na na na na or a button boom for a Subaru I go to or I have a job last week same thing and it's funny I thought if I go what if I was the comedian that told jokes but the crowd did laugh but before they left I started yelling at them why weren't they laughing that was you what do you mean what joke comes to my head so I go they go I go what can I do what can I do with that oh you know they say four out of five people suffer from diarrhea that means one guy enjoys it come on you people aren't even trying that's the joke I always think of so now what if four out of five four they say four out of five people suffer from diarrhea that means one guy enjoys it Subaru this is my go-to joke it works either way it's not bad anyway so I'm all better that's great I mean it only took I think that was like close to a year ago well you know what in all fairness I have to be fair you are tough but fair I said that about you always said that you have said that it took them all people say hey do you know a talk glass I go tough but fair tough but fair yeah you know what I do when you know people do that I try to think how quickly I can get the initials in my head so tough but but it was too many TBF yeah I couldn't do it TB FTG Subaru in all fairness when I did your show I didn't think to say tweet Subaru so I have to in all fairness which I'll say 10-15 times I'm getting 30 bucks from Subaru every time I say it all fairness by the time one they people tweeted it took them 24 hours before they've made everything awesome so that's pretty quick 24 hours like kids you're not that's really when they contacted you what did they say did they say they just said Todd we we want to make this right and we'll give you this goddamn what would your dad think about I don't know where my dad is but thanks for bringing up a terrible sorry that's right it's a you're just with your mother right and my stepdad set your stepdad set what would your stepdad I mean does is he able to discipline you or is that no that's why I call him by his first name right I'm just to show him who's boss when did he come a lot of things oh um eight and a half years ago what is your problem with him um I did he's listen he's fine he's waiting in the car outside I cracked a window I cracked a window for him oh you drove yeah I drove I cracked you have your permit no he's a really nice guy but hey but I very early on used techniques with him like in the dog whisperer to show him like he this is my turf you know what I mean I didn't want him like coming in and like being a dad you know what I mean you turn him over on his belly yeah exactly it's sometimes I go like you know like you pretend you're biting their neck that kind of thing yeah yeah yeah that kind of thing forming your hands into a claw yeah exactly claw formation yeah but yeah but he's a good guy never watch the dog whisper sure Todd I love it do you have some bits about it no I don't I just would have to be everything have to be a bit I mean I don't know that as long as I've known you we've never had a real conversation I don't want to have this fake I can stop it acrimony yeah we act like we have a like it's good it's good for entertainment value for me to be a contrarian to you maybe it's not good maybe I think it's good you know well I mean we just have a basic disagreement about just when I go to Queens you know Marissa do you have any quite as my co-host I guess not my intern because you've elevated your status here do you have any questions for Todd glass have you ever seen Todd's comedy I have I googled him last night and I saw a couple couple different clips that made me laugh very hard thank you and you know what I wanted to know how okay so how often do you perform this do you do stay if I wanted to get into stand-up which I'm thinking about which I'm thinking about how long would it take me to get to a point where I could make the real cold hard cash the lettuce a week maybe two yeah I mean it depends on where you start from you know if you're start if you already have jokes written it's probably a week if you have to write your jokes on day one it's two do you get paid for your bits or do you get paid right from the start or do they pay you in popcorn shrimp they pay you in laughs okay for every laugh that you elicit you get paid $100 so if there's a if I mean a good-sized crowd can you can make I know I made 5,000 on my first open mic night and I didn't get that many laughs that it was you get paid right from the beginning from the laughs Wow alright somebody out there believes this it sounds really easy it sounds like a really easy way to make quick money you've thought about doing stand-up yes I've thought about it what attracts you what about the art form attracts you to it well Scott are you masturbating when you talk to her yeah of course just what he does his creative process well I haven't really thought about like what my bits would be but I have thought about what I would wear mm-hmm oversized blazer okay tank top tight tank top it's a little slower and and and maybe and maybe to keep it keep it loose on bottom like a pleated situation on bottom yeah so tight tight tank top party on top business on the bottom but the blazer covers a lot of it yeah covers whatever I want you know like give them a little and then and then hide a little you'll see his catalog pose you pull it back I'll pull it back yeah put out three of your fingers into your pocket maybe I could be your intern Todd I could follow you from gig to gig fetch you your popcorn shrimp whatever you need she's not gonna just fetch you popcorn she's gonna be grabbing the mic from you know I think she'd be I think I don't want to say it in front of her what I think you seem like you're going through a very sexually charged and you're afraid that I wouldn't be able to keep my hands to myself well I think so there are those you know those 15 year old girls that you just can't have around you because I don't want to continue this I feel because I mean guys like you and me we always walk around with hard dicks so when a 15 year old girl is around if you accidentally like rub against her with it oh thank you I thought I was gonna like I was crazy and then that you say it but if there's two crazy people like that somewhere like one crazy person says you know whenever I whatever some twisted thing and the other crazy person goes thank you and they go oh my god I thought I was crazy that's what the internet is it's like people with weird fetishes fetishes something yeah but the internet last night and I know this has probably been talked about a lot internet commentator a tweety when people write negative stuff you know I've heard I've had my friends that I respect don't respond some people go I respond I retweet bad tweets most my friends say don't respond you know yeah you just ignore it last night one got the best of me oh no and you know bullied but before I first I'll tell you what it is better Todd somebody got the best of me over the dumbest thing in the world here's what they tweeted they wrote no offense but why was to Daniel Tosh not Daniel Tosh which is important yeah they wrote because it's not because anyone can say anything on Twitter in my opinion about an artist as long as you don't send it to them you know you can do even if you want to do that I get it if that's what they do if you were to say hey like and I don't feel this way at all if but if you were to say hey Todd glass is really super annoying and he's too old he's not ever gonna get famous you know he's like kind of like that home improvement episode he was on you know that was my bread and butter but if someone were to say something like that on Twitter that's just their opinion and you can't but it's when you send it to the person and like tag them in the right but still I should ignore it but the thing is so they did Daniel Tosh no offense but why was Todd glass at your he did event somewhere like a marathon and why was he there and I and then at to me so they wanted me to get it right so then I wrote back I can say whatever I need to say yeah yeah please curse up a storm I mean Marissa earmuffs yeah I wrote no no it's just so but out of all things to get me like why was he there like she needed to send that to me by the way if it could have been 30 times more vicious I think it would have less offended me but it was like why was Todd glass there like she said no offense and edge was so rude so I went because he invited me you cunt and then somebody tweeted me hey Todd don't be this guy and it was a cartoon of hold all my calls somebody's wrong on the internet right and actually I thought that made sense I was glad they sent it to me because it's saying you really somebody's wrong somebody and you're gonna go back and forth with this is one person out of the the billion right live in the United so I wrote maybe getting those facts wrong I wrote back to the second person you're right but then I wonder if there's people out there going you know what sometimes you need to say I don't know I don't what it was well you wrestle with it I mean I never enjoy watching people do it although I will say Paul of Tompkins does it in an artful manner which he always like makes sort of makes fun of them and retweets it but I never enjoy watching the back and forth I just you know isn't it the same as having a heckler live well you know but you would respond to a heckler but also but also what you're saying about a heckler after years and years of comedy I don't go back and forth with hecklers I used to because I got a laugh now my way is just get him out of the room not only that but no one else is seeing this but you so it's not like something you have to deal with what do you mean no one else is saying meaning no none of your followers are seeing this this insult it's not like a heckler they aren't no I thought when they send it to you everyone can see it no no no no no no no no one can see the things that people are writing to you but then how did someone say don't be that guy cuz he saw his response because I retweeted it yeah exactly I made that happen yeah see what I mean like a heckler you have to deal with it otherwise because it's the elephant and by the way you know let me just say this for what it's worth I know I get the say inside of me I've had the where you go stop don't you know it can be great one night after a show somebody wrote me something I had a little problem with somebody in the audience and somebody tweeted me something I'm not kidding you made me feel so good like I went to bed better because someone tweeted something kind so I get it you get the good you get the bad ignore it but in a moment of the stupidest little thing and it wasn't that bad and then she then she writes back to me I swear she writes um how did you even see that and I wrote no offense and I wanted to read I wanted to retweet cunt and then put no offense after it but I thought then the person said hey don't get you know the person that said hold on my call who is this person somebody on my Twitter account that wrote oh so you don't know your followers no I know one of them if you were Ronald Reagan you would have known every one of them how do you know who Ronald Reagan is I know who people in history are he wrote back personally to all of his fans shut up he spent most of his time writing personal notes back that's why you know he wrote back to one fan 700 times you know yeah he that's that famous quote of his he was writing back to mr. Gorbachev tear down that wall no offense you know somebody wants to do their old impersonation so they'll say like yeah I was watching that then you know history channel today they had Ronald Reagan okay well so you're gonna do your 30-year-old impersonation didn't get you on Saturday Night Live the first time all right you have a lot of strong opinions about comedy you know what I you know what I used to when I heard Ronald Reagan when he got into the White House Jimmy Carter had all the solar power I don't follow politics that well but this alone for some reason you have the solar panels up in the White House solar power Jimmy Carter ahead of his time right and now Ronald Reagan and Ronald Reagan got in there someone told me this and he took them all out and for some reason I went you old dumb fuck yeah just just he probably just get him off the roof it's off not that oh it's there I wouldn't have put him in but like if that's true it might not be true but it might be true just like picture him oh get that fucking shit off of there we don't need no solar panel what are we gay hippies so you just launched into a really old bit about Ronald Reagan's fairness it's in it's in context no I swear to God I did not I did not do that oh and here's the thing when people were doing in per I'm gonna defend myself here when people were doing impersonation to Ronald Reagan I never did it so it's I never did and by the way I'm not considering this an impersonation of Ronald Reagan it's the one everybody can do now you do do some impersonations that no one else can do you do you you do the world's greatest Donahue I feel like you've done it anymore I have to I know because no one knows no one knows who would it do Marissa have you ever even heard of Donahue well this is my down to you well tear down that wall you mr. garbage mr. garbage job a job a job a job well the Subaru people are good people you can't just say you're not gonna do something on the show the whole show is based on yes and yeah yes because I read a book about it a what book truth in comedy really get it you know what let me as a personal gift to you give you that book you would benefit I do give you a highlighter as well so you can highlight pertinent parts I have an improv for me are we it's called no but maybe we talked about this no we talked about this on the show the other day we played a little no but in fact maybe we should play right now really it's it's no but basically so okay so you Marissa you know how to do improv why don't you start with a premise and we'll play no but okay it'll go to me in that your school yeah I teach an improv class at my school a lot of freeze-tag yeah freeze tag different party gay party quirks what I love about freeze-tag is tag is how like and how many moves can you get it to be something sexual yeah oh yeah like one freeze because oh stop fucking me we used to do improv when I was like 18 when I didn't have enough material and it was all choreography was all the same every night I go I'll put my hands in my pocket and then someone would go freeze and they'd go hey do you frogs in there we would get in the positions so the other person could freeze us and then act like it was an ad-lib I only did that three times and then I asked the other comedian I'm this is true by Friday I went I'm not good at improv and I'd rather not do shitty improv so can we not do it at all like touching you anymore yeah that's what it was really about no I like that all right so you start with a premise okay does it have to be a real-world premise it's anything just like we're on Mars and our spaceship is run out of so do this conversationally where you come up to me and you see you okay oh okay established the scene oh hey Scott how's life on Mars well we're not on Mars but where we are is communist Russia and that's the Kremlin right over there why are you naked and what's that pizza who's that pizza for you got to add the no pardon wait what the no part is no we're not on no we're not in communist Russia but we are on Mars and then it's a callback yeah I think you may have just mastered no but improv done all right Todd come on please let's not make a big deal every time I say it just move on otherwise I can't keep saying all right tell you what let's go to a break when we come back we'll have a little yeah no we're gonna go to break and you're gonna come back can I say one thing okay what do you need this is probably the most important no no don't plug your shit okay that's happening at the end can I say one thing wop it up all right wop it up we'll be right back if this is a comedy bang bang super today's just a this is comedy bang bang I'm here with Todd glass and Marissa Wampler has inserted herself into the program and Todd I see you writing stuff down on that paper what's going on just writing some things that I want to remember like oh I'm sorry what do you want to talk about no no I'm all good I talked about this you know at the end I wanted to write all my plugs okay I see when he was writing at first I thought he was writing notes to himself like don't be so stupid Todd glass like covering it up with my hand writing mean words well I I believe that it is time for one of our most beloved features on this show it's time to play a little game that we like to call what am I thinking what are you muttering no I'm wondering is that what did you write down what you're thinking I know I wrote down what am I thinking so the engineer could know to play look at it if it's what you don't have to cheat yeah this before I can't remember so this is one of your favorite are we really supposed to guess what you're thinking yeah yeah yeah okay not what I'm thinking we're gonna play the two of you okay okay so we all know how this is played so go no no basically you're each going to separately think of a word or a thing it can be two it can be Roger Rabbit it can be a name it can be you know it can be microwave oven you know I mean it yes so just a thing you're gonna think of a thing a person place your thing Roger Rabbit the first thing on your mind I love to dance so then you're going to look at each other's eyes and count back from three down to one and then you're going to say your word after one so it'll be three two one Roger Rabbit okay ostensibly you'll say two different words

right ready Marissa have you locked in color and vegetables okay there's there's a perfect answer I know I know okay all right here we hope you think of what I'm thinking ready and three two one green green green vegetables green color okay well what was yours oh I guess I thought you said fruit I was thinking orange right wait would that be sense she said I said vegetable she said what nervous at all in this game started and now I feel like it's gotten very tense out on me too wait what did you guys say he said green and grape green and grape not bad green and grape what are they having come on common what haven't come in okay and great okay okay here we go ready green and grape and three two one color there you go fantastic see Todd you did it all right that was this you know what it is it's not a big deal I don't know if it has anything to do with my like dyslexia or whatever but it makes me think and then I start sweating I get it's like brings me back to like everything I oh it's just like you know it's terrible if that was only the qualifying round now you go up against me no yeah here we go ready no I'm not joking all right lock in a word like torture plus it's hot oh my lock in a word you got it there must be a reason I am sweating profusely you know people don't believe I sweat sometimes I'll say to somebody I'll go you know like a sweaty purse I don't a sweaty man I when I and I was 25 pounds heavier worse we both lost weight but sometimes I'll say to someone I'm sweating I don't want to hug you and they'll go come on don't be stupid like you know I'm just saying it like I don't want to touch someone which I don't have that germaphobe or anything so I go oh fine I got us talking they're like oh gross I go yeah I fucking told you yeah I'm sweating like a secret moisture you've got going on Jesus look at that yeah yeah yeah I'm sorry it's gross and by the way when I sweat on stage you know what I know and I'll tell you why I know I apologize to the audience when it's when it's gross because when I watch Robin Williams on his HBO special and he sweats I think he should apologize yeah he does apologize every 60 seconds when you're sweating like that yeah and by the way one other quick thing nothing to I am really surprised when Robin Williams shot his HBO special the last one he has all the money in the world why they didn't have you know they could have had that stage so bitter cold right yeah that I don't think it would have mattered it wouldn't have mattered he's just he's just a sweaty guy like just any kind of physical exertion I feel but you see here's the thing this is an oral show so you don't oral oral it's oral it's an oral experience you may you are a L it's an oral experience for people so you don't have to apologize because no one knows you're sweating yeah I mean to people in the room oh we don't mind we accept you for who you are time glass are you crying right now oh my god do you need the tears correct she's very mature oh thank you Todd yeah man your tears are just Todd this that's the kind of moral and emotional support I could provide for you on the road yeah along with servings of popcorn shrimp can you imagine if I started bringing a 15 year old on the road like wherever I want Jerry Lee Lewis and nothing you know it would be just a sexual thing it would just be innocent travel companions yeah well you knew what you were getting 18 love but then but then that would be 18 in two years Todd so you know just I'm not really gonna have you're being your 60s by then shot I've always imagined myself to be with an older man people always like in my 60s when you know what I'm not that much older than you know you know we are we are pretty much the same age seemed it seemed a lot older even you said one day you were like because at one point it does seem older like when no yeah I mean we I was surprised to hear the lie about your age that you gave me so do you know I'm not lying about my age I don't know I don't lie about this I hate because I'm being honest about it mm-hmm the age thing at times I can be for a lack of a better way of saying I can be a total woman about it but I think when you say you're a woman about it a woman is just honest about it I think inwardly it bothers a lot of guys too I think so too but at certain ages don't you know and I think like sometimes I can get myself worked up into a panic thinking okay the last 20 years the last 30 years didn't go quick I'll say that last 30 years seems like a long time but 20 are you shitting me when I think where I was 20 years ago it seems like yesterday then I think how old I'll be in 20 years and I can get myself worked up into a lather I was thinking about that the other day yeah exactly it just like only goes one way that's true you know what I mean like it's real you're right and then I think well Fred Willard and then and then as I'm thinking this the next day on TV I think someone said you know Fred Willard's turning like 67 I went oh that's well you know that's good if that's 67 that's funny Shatner is 80 who William Shatner huh he's 80 years old what are you talking about he's 80 years old he doesn't he does not see it no but you know I'm saying like he's out there fine yeah it's 80 years old how's Don Rickles he is 90 something shut up you shut the fuck up you know one time I was doing a ride along with my friend and he told some girl that her both her backlights were out and she was being you know just sweet she goes shut up he goes don't tell me to shut up she went no no I just meant his expression he goes I know I was kidding what a great and we'll take a break we'll be wait a minute I'm starting a podcast so I can throw it a commercial we'll take a break we'll be right back you're listening to comedy bang bang that's really good we still have to get to the finals here yes I know I noticed and I am not playing that anymore notice we never mentioned my age the whole age conversation purposely no you're not an old man you're you're you're a vibrant healthy part of our community it's almost worth telling you how old I am no I do you don't want to play this game okay because when I when I got to know you back in 1995 mm-hmm I thought you were probably 52 you swear to god no both seem like you're in your late 50s to me okay okay let's play the let's play the game you locked you locked in yes okay all right ready no we go okay think of a word yeah any word yes okay okay ready and go say it with me yeah Florida okay I was gonna say hamburger you gotta go three two one but I was gonna say hamburger that's all right okay as the judge I think it's okay so Florida and hamburger Florida and hamburger and then think of whatever they have in common Florida okay and hamburger okay now we count down so three two one and then say the word all right ready here we go three two one sizzle not bad oh heat and sizzle I think I might have it right here we go three two one temperature see that is how it is played see when you're playing with someone cool in here I could even be better let's meet at a meat locker we play this game all day no I now I'm into I think you know what it is I don't like not being good at something that's why I will not work out of the gym right anybody is on a new piece of equipment I won't do it I will not so I've been on this I kid you not ask anyone that runs into me at the gym I have been on the same piece of equipment for eight years using a medicine ball oh I won't do the medicine ball matter of fact my manager bought me for Christmas 15 sessions with a trainer and I knew I didn't want to be the guy that went in and told the trainer what my stipulations were I knew he'd be like no come on get over I said I gotta ask you a favor I go I'll do whatever you ask but I don't want to do anything that makes me feel like stupid like the medicine ball or taking leaps across the gym when everyone's around you know when you have to do the wide step I go I'll do anything on a machine because it's sort of red it's how your movement will be yeah you know so I don't want to do it and he said okay and it's been okay really medicine ball thing I feel like an oversized special needs person yes like also the kettlebells have you seen those I we have a we have a gym in my condo and I went down there they had these new kettlebells I was like I was swinging them I hit myself in the vagina whoa I knocked myself out you can knock yourself unconscious by hitting the vagina I fell down and I was like oh my god I broke it I broke it and then I went upstairs and Seth was the only one there I was sure not gonna talk to him about it I inspected it things are okay okay but they weren't okay for a while yeah you can get toxic shock syndrome from that no you can't you have to put a kettlebell up there and leave it there well I don't know what you're up to in this condo of yours all right real quickly Todd talk about the gym used to have an intriguing way of getting inside the gym I did and I can show it to you right now if you want to see sure it's visual but yeah I would I would can I do it now yeah sure okay Todd is leaving the room he took a glass of water with him and now he's going to enter the room he poured water all over his shirt so he looked like he just was sweating and you would just walk into the gym and go the way it started was I was on the road a lot and honestly even though I know people be like oh sure I was on the road a lot and I don't want to be tour a gym so if you just go to a gym sorry about that left the door open if you go to a gym they want to maybe show you around or they you know I'm not right area people lie and say that so they don't listen so I realized when I go to my own gym ballies back then when I was a member I didn't want to wait in line to shoot back then there was a line so I would just walk in you I was in they never stopped me and if they did I wasn't scared because I am a member so I wasn't like if they went whoa whoa whoa we still need to check you so after doing that literally for a year no one ever said hey I'd go when I moved I wasn't a member of the L it wasn't a Bally's around me so I started doing the LA Fitness right every single day for a literally a year and a half I did that I never paid never paid finally I go I have to join it's ridiculous but I couldn't join you have a conscience I couldn't join at the gym because they all knew me by that point they were like so I had to go down the Marina del Rey and join the LA Fitness I want to join join you've been coming in here but now I'm a member and by the way at my LA Fitness and I tweeted this today there I think I don't know I'm just guessing because I look around oh they must be having a contest they're having a contest on how filthy they can get the gym at La Cienica and they I gotta give them credit I don't want to always be negative they are trying so hard to win I want them to win I mean they are paper towels everywhere I mean it's just it's so inspiring they they want to win this yeah they haven't like they haven't steam cleaned the locker room ever it smells like shit God bless them well Todd you have one more round to play on this game so you and Marissa lock into your words okay all right okay who are you playing for by the way we never established this I know how to cheat on this game I think you just say well I don't want to tell you know if I see any pauses you're out no no no it's not that I'll tell you later okay tell me later but who are you playing for oh we're playing for somebody yeah yeah where's the money go if you win oh how much is it it's a good amount okay hmm even in this even though I know there's no money I'm really we'll give it to the the if you were in your improv class what would you be teaching him just go with your first thought time American Cancer Association okay great and who are you playing before puppies behind bars oh my god so cute on Oprah I saw this thing puppy mills but no not puppy mills they train puppies to be like seeing dogs for like Pete veterans that have PTSD and stuff but they give them to prisoners to train and so the puppies live inside in their little you know cells and then they teach them and one puppy was so beloved by all the prisoners that they would carry it from thing to thing that it didn't really want to walk anymore because it was they were taking so I like that yeah when you said it I had assumed it would be to try to get puppies out from behind bars but it's to keep them in yeah keep them keep them behind bars great okay then let them out to help people okay after how long after to ten after five to ten depending on how naughty that puppy was all right oh so wait they're naughty puppies that was a part that you didn't even really go into at the top these are actually naughty puppies did you see this there was a guy he had a seeing eye dog and the seeing eye dog went blind so they got that dog a seeing eye dog you see him walking down the street it's this the dog the blind dog and the blind guy and why didn't the blind false we'll find out your guesses we'll be right back come on come on guys no no no we still have to play this game that's false by the way yeah I assume so all right lock into a word don't you assume anything they have miniature ponies that are also seeing eye ponies did you know that and they have little tiny they have they have tiny shoes they put on their hooves you know what I thought of can I say one more thing yeah please yeah I know you're stalling but go ahead no no I'm not I swear I you know when when somebody gets like I heard someone's got someone got their dog a massage now I always take a complete u-turn in my opinion at first I thought sounds like somebody just rich with nothing to do with you get your dog a massage and you're somebody from Irvine would do or Beverly Hills but then I thought about something no if you get your dog a massage now I never have but that's someone who gets it because all a dog does is bring joy into your life yeah so where are you investing your money in your life where are you spending when you have money are you getting a nicer car are you going no I want to spend it on the dog something that brings nothing but joy and tranquility so the people that are nuts are the people that don't get there if you're not getting your dog a massage what are you doing with your money that's better invested than that if you have kids I get it I'm talking about with extra money money we are you gonna go buy a nicer car you're gonna go you know what I'm gonna get a $300 month car instead of a 500 and spend $200 a month getting my dog a massage that's it so if you don't get your dog a massage including me we're the ones that have the fucking illness you're an asshole what don't yes we'll be right back we'll take a break I have to say that I often give my dog a doggy massage and then I realize you don't call it a human massage when you like your girlfriend human massage massage do you know why I think it's easier to give your dog a massage when you feel like doing number one it is that can't run away to watch to watch the where they do fall where they their body goes on they let go and they don't tell you you know when you're giving your girlfriend a massage it might be like now go over there a little harder they're like ah just a dog just takes what you give it yeah so if you want a massage from somebody just when they're giving it to you shut up don't start giving them harder they're softer there then it's gonna end in 30 seconds I think what we're saying is women should be more like dogs thank you wow take a break we'll be right back my dog has to put peanut butter on himself for me to give him a massage he spreads peanut butter on his shoulders why because that's the only way I'll give him a massage all right have you locked in yes right all right here we go do you have a word Marissa yes all right staring to each other's eyes okay a little higher Marissa here we go ready and three three three two one mall Skippy and mole Skippy or mall oh mall okay that's oh that's interesting oh Skippy and mall Skippy and mall what do they have in common one is a shopping center sometimes indoors sometimes outdoors Skippy brand of peanut butter but you could also say that it's a nickname of someone on family ties skipping Skippy Skippy yeah it's harder I know what you mean because there's something for skipping say exercise Skippy and mall all right lock in oh no you gotta lock in well you got it if I don't have anything I don't have it we'll go go with your first instinct it can be anything okay oh you're right it just takes the

wait thank you very much that is how we play what am i thinking love jingles by the way on my it's one of these it's one of these I'm gonna have more jingles than anybody all right let us take this break that Todd has been talking about and we come back we'll have a little more Marissa Wampler a little more top glass this is comedy bang bang I like that is Tim and Eric this is comedy bang bang we are here of course with Todd glass our special guest and Marissa Wampler is my intern 15 year old intern here and you any other questions for Todd about his life let's see we cover the popcorn shrimp are you married no okay anybody special in your life oh but you're looking would you like to have a summer romance not with me I'm asking like for your mom what was your mom held your mom my mom uh what let's probably 35 or she's like in her 40 yeah or 44 or something like that I don't really know I don't really care oh okay yeah I don't like to think about people's ages cuz then I think about mortality oh have you has anyone close to you ever died my Nana died hmm and sad day that was a really sad day but luckily I've had a lot of I've had a lot of luck on the mortality front not many people have kicked it and some people have that you disliked yes yeah exactly that's true my luck when my grandfather died we were going to the from the like one the funeral to where they bury him or whatever you know where they have the services to where they bury him and there was some guys selling pretzels on the corner I remember this specifically and my aunt was in the car with my mom and my dad and we wanted soft pretzels so when the car was parked we rolled down the window of like the limo and we said in Philly yes we said hey can we uh we were pretzels and my uncle's before it happened she goes no no no that's disrespectful and my mom goes no it's not disrespectful if the boys want pretzels why is that disrespected to resist respectful their grandfather and they are and that that became like they didn't talk for like whoa and I know what in hindsight I agree with my mom my mom was right she goes there's nothing to do it's just phony my aunt was being just old and like what you she just perceived that what you can't eat pretzels cuz someone died I agree with your aunt those are delicious you do you know honestly do you honestly yeah it's disrespectful if you knew my grandfather it's like I'll give you an example I didn't know your grandfather you actually you didn't know my grandfather I forgot about that and I think it would be disrespectful to him I think you owe him an apology on air on air on air I think you owe the movie Con Air an apology hold on for what it's worth yeah who said Con Air yeah um if you know when you like I remember once like when somebody dies and you make a joke like a comedian and somebody that doesn't get it oh that's disrespectful you go no that's everything that my grandfather was not this uptight stiff guy I know and I know it seems like I'm just saying it because I wanted pretzels I was only a 14 by the way my mom took they can see took it into consideration now let me let me just for what it's worth if it was not our funeral if it was a friend of a friend's all right they don't get but it was it was us it was us in the car we weren't we weren't sitting there with like someone that my dad worked with and it was their aunt it was it was us in the car so my mom was right how about how about when my Nana when she died we have an open casket or whatever and all of us it was really gross right all of us were in there and they like showed it she like opened it up right and she didn't have very prominent lips but they'd given her like really big lips really and so my aunt was like like cocksucking lips you're on notice I am putting you on notice for that not right as if that's a phrase here's the funeral director okay so I think we have everything down we are going to do an open casket oh I'm sorry this is my first day do you want her to have cocksucking lips yes is that a yes okay cocksucking lips on a scale from one to ten how big you want her cocksucking lips ten of course of course what are you doing later by the way by the way just in case so later can we do the paperwork I know your grandfather's still alive do you want your grandfather to have cocksucking lips yes just no pretzels no pretzels at any rate my aunt leaned over to kind of get rid of the like to make up I thought they put like a pair of wax lips in there no surgery you can't do that to a dead person they just drew it on with lipstick and she started to smudge it and that was a slippery slope and then they were like and we're opening the doors and that's how it started oh and so like like half of her face fell off and you just see like an exposed skull it wasn't like a zombie situation my grandmother wasn't a zombie but it was really upsetting I'm sorry you think videotaping a funeral I remember weird things and I remember when I was probably like 18 we had a neighbor two over and they had someone die in their family and they were at the funeral videotaping right the funeral now my parents thought that that was wrong I remember and as a kid you just think you do weddings why not gonna want to pop that film in oh let's you know what it's been a year let's pop some popcorn and watch the funeral well people say a lot of nice things about someone you love watch that again I mean if the people crying that was probably hard to get through but I mean the people giving testimonials to people I mean they get they videotape and broadcast famous people's funeral that's true so that's what I'm saying like when you're little you just say whatever your parents say is right yeah but you're right now and I've held on to that like oh they videotaped their funeral and then I'm thinking expand your mind man right I'm gonna videotape my funeral I have so many things that I've said when I'm dead like my friend Mike McHale who is an editor and keeping a list yeah no no I I have him turn on the camera and I go okay I know this is sad but I'm dead now I go I'm dead look at me I'm dead I go Mike you have this if I die I want this footage show to my funeral and I go I'm dead I know there's something morbidly sad about it but if there's something funny enjoy it I'm dead look at me I'm dead I'm literally dead like I did this as a joke but now I'm dead and everyone's gathering around and I'm dead you know what's weird is I I genuinely got emotional when you said that you were gonna die is that weird I mean no that's all right that means you have a shows you have a good a good soul he did you're you like I kind of flush yeah just imagining your funeral so sometimes you know sometimes you just get a little emotional and that's how people are gonna that's how people are gonna react when all of a sudden they see your video and you're making fun of their feelings like this oh I didn't want to make fun of their feelings yeah that's how it that's how it's gonna be I'm gonna be sitting there bawling my eyes out and you're gonna be not to bring back Nancy Reagan but you're gonna pull one of those where you're like lay yourself on the casket of Todd Glass and you won't be able to know so much about the Reagan's what is going on here I want those I want those god damn solar powers taking off the fucking roof do you think he cursed that much get them the fuck off of their Jimmy Carter that hippie freak trying to well we don't do that it's not right and I won't say the word AIDS and I certainly won't have solar power on the top of the White House what is this a hippie tent god damn it do things like Michael did you know how Lisa Marie Presley always said Michael Jackson never talked like Michael Jackson around the house he was like oh hey what's up you swear to God yeah she'd set that in every one well you'd be like hey Lisa Marie what's going down no not like that yeah no seriously exactly like that that is exactly the the imitation ah you know what I wouldn't doubt that I'm still gonna hold on to even though you're swearing it then it's not that bad you know Lisa Marie that's exactly watch that bring up the interview bring up the interview right yeah I'm gonna say with a if I had to guess I'm gonna guess there's truth to that hmm and I still ended with there's truth so do you think that Reagan was like that where he'd be he'd basically he would do what you did where you know I think that was probably pretty well he's he'd be walking well you know do you think why am I doing this I swear that Todd paid me earlier to bring up Reagan as much as possible so he can do this long forgotten impression first of all I swear to God because there are people I never did a Ronald Reagan impersonation in my act when it was right I started for some reason making fun of people doing it and then it happened if you if anybody can find any footage of me doing Ronald Reagan what will you pay them $500 that's how well 10,000 okay 10,000 or tell you what you take your mother's new Subaru and you give it you give it to that person who finds I can't do that yeah no that's exactly what you have to do okay I will okay you've heard it here tweet Todd glass I like how I was gonna argue with you that I couldn't do it because the insurance reasons like what the fuck am I doing Scott's not really expected me to that person with the suit do you want dick sucking lips on your grandmother or no we didn't say dick suck it was cock sucking dick sucking sounds worse all right it's time to move on it's time to play our most beloved feature on the the show it's time to play would you rather Todd have you played this with us before you know I haven't but I've I was at someone's house over the weekend there's actually the game yeah you I would imagine you'd be very good at this do you play this in high school yes we've played this in high school I said the right name yes yes you did what do you like what if I told you the truth this is really gross okay but there's one thing that has never been beaten it of a would you rather okay okay and it's that there's this is horror oh my god this is horrible there's this teacher that we can't stand I want to say who it is but he's really gross and his mouth he has a goatee around his mouth and it does look like a vagina like it looks like a vagina at any rate and somebody said like a shaved porn stars vagina like yeah sort of like but it's just like a porn star from like 1997 yeah exactly I wasn't gonna say current at any rate people were saying like would you rather these horrible things or that every day he has to come to your house at 5 p.m.
