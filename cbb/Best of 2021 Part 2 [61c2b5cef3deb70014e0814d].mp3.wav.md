because that LFO song I like girls to wear Abercrombie a bitch Chinese food makes me sick and you were like oh I'm gonna stay away from that of course LFO is so similar to elephant isn't it it's too similar it's like it's too similar I would imagine a story about three blind men going to an LFO concert and describing it you know okay what Paul's referring to is that classic tale of like five different blind men feeling a thing and one is like this feels like palm trees and one is like this feels like a hose and one is like this feels like a tree trunk and one is like this feels like a giant elephant's dick okay all right Scott which one was it they were all feeling an elephant but because they couldn't see the whole thing and by the way the E was a part of it it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger come on now this is in front of baked goods you do this yes it tastes like an elephant's dick too right how would you know that's what I said okay to this get to this blind guy but he was facing the wrong way the first hand story never heard me what was the fifth guide feeling well what is yeah what what is a little snake I think that he feels a tale yeah all right is it our elephants tails curly no that's no those are pigs that's pigs those are pigs why are they gonna do elephant why are pigs tails curl why are pigs tails curly I don't know but it's speaking of animal dicks and we were yep I don't remember if pigs might be one of those animals that have a twisty dick as well I think they do yeah like their tails and they're I don't know I guess the tail is to let you know what's going on it's like hey there's no different on the front side check this out okay so yes or no this is the part you're allowed to see can't say didn't warn you I feel bad for the for the lady animals yeah I know to have to sit through that like a cat is like being having sex with a pig is how you're talking about of course that's what I'm talking about this is ball of Tom kids you

either part can you still on first thought best first thought here we go boom butter balls are a cookie butter balls are a cookie sis he's just got baking on the mind that sounds good my mind is clearer now is it what I think it's like a round cooking it's a ball of butter it's just like a ball of butter that's cooked and then are there any other ingredients sugar I would have oh nuts I know what these are and then you roll would you go on the great British baking show even though you're not British would they have me would you tell them to stop doing those skits yeah we're asking you

didn't announce but they have they have people from all around the world but are they all British citizens I think they're all British citizens even even Italian guy I believe that he actually German guy I think so I don't know who knows maybe it's just they're close by maybe they have like a certain cap on how much they'll pay for flights I would think that after Brexit they wouldn't allow people who are not British citizens that's a printer guys welcome to comedy bang bang it's a lot of this it is thank you so much to this mystery person you are excused I'll send you the thing for that and

our first special guests on these they're I don't think we've ever have we ever had anybody else on Mike during a best of I don't know but that reminds me I want to talk about Jarls classic Charles classic Jarls guys first I want to welcome everyone welcome to the best of comedy bang bang part two today we will be counting down your choices for the number 11 number 10 number 9 and number 8 episode of the year in the time very big right now I like that Howard Kramer joke about he saw someone wearing a t-shirt that says the Beatles and he's like you could just be wearing a t-shirt that says food you pick the most popular thing how it's funny it's very funny who charted of course is one of his many podcasts very funny guy but we're gonna be counting down these episodes these are clips this is what you the the people have voted on over the past few weeks to let us know what your favorite episodes of the year are everyone picked up to 10 episodes that they could vote on and we're gonna be hearing clips this episode if you've never listened to the show before this is your first episode you must go back at least to the previous episode at least a few days that will explain to you what the show is what you're listening to I don't know why you would listen to the best of part two as your first episode I mean but you know what I respect somebody that does that yeah well you know what I bet one of the guests maybe on here is someone that they were like oh maybe I should listen to this sure so I bet that happened sure yeah and they're like fuck it I'll listen it says best says best it says two that the fourth best well that's my point the third best is if you look at the actual numbers and I hope that you do look at those numbers of the show the best of part one is always the worst of the best and it's the worst of the best of that's my point everyone should be listening to number four do you think people think it's the best of the best ofs and so they're gonna be like we're counting here's what I think it ever does I think a ton of people go best of this new show the show I've heard about and they listen to the first one go like not for me yeah do you think it's people that are regular listeners to the show and they have some skin in the game they're like I want this episode to be maybe I know number one and they listen to it and it's like oh it's number 14 fuck this fuck this people do take it very seriously and I appreciate that where they there there I believe there are people who get very upset if something was not voted on button it's it's democratic that's a democracy we got it sucks we got to share air with these fucking losers yeah and of course they're voted on there's a sort of electoral college element to it sure yeah I mean that's part of it yes where you ultimately decide what you think is the best yeah and you but you take their vote into consideration sure yeah I mean it's a suggestion yeah I get where you're coming from that's not true this is all above board do you want to save Charles for later or do you want to talk about Charles now let's talk about Charles get into him before we get into the next all right my goodness classic Charles well while he's on our mind a character sidelined by the pandemic one of the only I cannot think of another character that anyone has said to me like I just don't think that can work on zoom in the in the pandemic yeah this was a character that you were like it's got to be in person explain the way Charles came about was I if I was here at your old studios if I were here at your will studios to do recording something of on your own something on my own somebody else's podcast and I saw that there was a comedy bang bang in process in process and progress in progress we were making progress making progress and they were in the process of doing that I would just go in there unbeknownst to all of us as I describe it it sounds like a rude thing to do but we enjoyed it but yeah it was always a treat it was always in good fun I would just sit in there and then I would start talking and I I started talking as this guy he's doing a weird voice did you come in with a name Charles or did you I think that came about I think I was asked who I was and then I had to come up with something and you said Charles Charles Charles with a J and Charles is a guy with a very unique voice right he talks like that he's got a very thin windpipe that's right and so he struggles to get words out and he's a fencing instructor that's right and he just passes through the ear will know he's lost and he's very devout he's very devout yes and he's lost in the he's lost in the building he's been looking for the bathroom yes five six years so it's a character that I've only ever done in that way that I never done him as like I'm gonna introduce our next guest classic Charles because he would just be weird to have the guy actually meaning to be there exactly it's always an interruption yeah and it's only on other people's but it's did it start it started on the the commentaries oh oh in the start of the commentaries I'm the DVD commentary recorded for the TV show bang it probably did yeah you're right did okay yeah I you're I was famous you're asking me a question about the history of the show and how would I know but you sure talk about it a lot on these um not on these but in general um I think I think that it did start and the idea was he was lost there and maybe it was an episode that I was not supposed to be on or something I don't remember you were you were talking with someone else I can't remember but it was the same premise but yeah um and then during the I will say that during the quarantine when we were all recording from home it did cross my mind to ask ask someone when ask the person who was just here that we will not name when I was recording an episode when you would zoom bomb secretly get the zoom link and zoom bomb well you know what that something akin to that happens on one of the episodes coming up and so we'll talk about that now I'm mad that I didn't do it yeah you should have done it I should have done it I'm angry with myself yeah and I'm angry with you and I'm angry with you I'm not angry at myself so that's the one relationship that's still how can I get you there what's it gonna take to get me angry with my what's it gonna take for you to feel some self-loathing by the end of the day another three hours of this um all right so we're gonna be counting down yeah I know more like four we're gonna be counting down these episodes let's just get to it let's get to it let's get to it let's get to it let's get to it let's get to it as I struggle to figure out which episode is coming up okay this is your choice for episode number 11 number one one okay episode number 11 and the last of the number one one like that yeah that's the last time you'll hear it that's the last time well and at the very end of the clip you'll hear it again so it's true one more time before more time to hear it and then you'll never hear that again because in June or July you're going to remind us that it's time to record the numbers and you'll remind us of wet day as well and every time you have lunch you'll say you'll say it again you hear three assignments you understood the assignment and we will tell you that you understood the assignment yeah if you do all those things yes if a lot of people want responses from us all you have to do is do those three things prove it yes and we will write back to you you understood the assignment now that only applies to the reminder for wet day the reminder for the numbers the other one the identity again after you lunch that's just yours for lifetime we don't need to be reminded of that no but we will need proof on on wet day that you have been doing it every single day on wet day yes by the time wet day rolls around yes please let us have taped yourself

you're doing it and that you're a different clothes it takes different clothes you want to do you want to close the full house did you watch the live from in front of the studio audience thing I didn't if for the first couple it was like these great Norman Lear shows that were like social commentary and say and then this year they picked different strokes and facts of life like shows for children that suck who was in different strokes uh that was small enough to be Arnold I thought you were asking me about the original show like where they get to be different strokes I remember reading that script and I thought oh shit they got Kevin hot rat Bane Kevin Hart was Arnold come on and Damon Wayans was Willis what are we doing I mean there was a height difference what but they but these shows were just like I usually I enjoy these and this time I was just like yeah I yeah these shows sucked when they came out yeah anyway these these clips that were hearing did not suck when they came out and in fact they're so good way people voted on why do people do anything why do people do here we go this is episode 721 from August 30th 2021 episode give me the episode number 721 from August 30th 2021 so we have a couple of 21s in there ones what can I mean I don't know 42 hundreds from now will anyone remember the alive or remember that we did this can you imagine 21 21 like is this still bouncing off a no not satellite satellite a podcast I think there'd have to be some sort of signal here on the ground but that's how it gets servers have to be too electricity has to still be going so I bet I bet everything will be gone shit some bright cheery thoughts tonight why do anything I gotta get out of here yeah you gotta go say I do your what of course you know I say what impressed that is no we though this is an episode called passion of the pasta passion of the pasta let me say who's in this we have the improvisers are our good friend Eggo Wodum from SNL that's right we have from the other two we have Drew Tarver absolutely also from a little show called bajillion dollar properties which starred Paul F. Tompkins thank you number one of the call sheet and the celebrity guest is a person by the name of Phoebe Bridgers this is a good episode that I enjoyed very much this is a good episode this is maybe who I was talking about who if you were like best of Phoebe Bridgers oh I'll listen to this so that's why someone might be this might be their first sure absolutely yes and this was Phoebe's first episode that she was ever on and coincidentally the last I don't know if it will always be the last of this recording as if this recording is the last and this is a funny episode we can talk about it afterwards yeah we don't talk about now we don't have to talk about it now but uh Eggo is playing a new character that she just came up with and this is her she's actually was in studio she was here this is in August so she was not taping Saturday Night Live at the time so she was here for a couple of weeks I believe and so we got a few episodes in here's what I heard is that they get breaks when Lauren Michaels he he goes into a trance or a spell or something yeah and he fully hibernates as well that's what it is yeah and so he goes in his little cave and then they're like oh yeah we can live our lives and then they go do whatever they want whatever they want yeah they I mean they don't want to be doing that show you know you know they'd prefer to be like doing what we do going out having lunch exactly saying I did it again so Eggo was here and then Drew was playing a character that he has played before who is a person who drives pageant queens around right so let's hear a few clips from this this is what you chose to be your episode 11 number one one let's list your controversies yeah smashing that guitar yes that was a big one yeah on that on that show that we were talking about oh yeah now you smashed a guitar and sparks came out of it yes yeah that was that was a little goofy but it was it was planned yes like people were upset that I like disrespected you know what was upset was that dude from what was he from the birds you know that you know what was there man called something cross the flap around in the air cross we still some shit yeah the titular Crosby yeah the cross is he's called he was it what was he upset about he was upset about the guitar being smashed or he was upset about you didn't smash it good enough yeah I mean I was upset that I didn't smash it good enough but I whoa wait whoa now okay let's list the guitars being smashed that are good okay the who used to do it right you know I don't even think I've it's funny because they sent me Dan electro the company the guitar company I was like I'm gonna smash this guitar just warning you that's and by the way a good musician always does that yeah I don't know why the guitar company Kirk obane you should do that all the time shoots out little email before yeah this and by the way emails were not common back but he would do it the first email he invented email yeah so so I emailed the guitar company and they said oh my god that's so cool and here's a video of someone trying and failing to do it FYI it's really hard because their guitars are built so uh earthy yes and I didn't even watch it because I was like I got it you know you're a professional musician you smashed guitars before um but anyway it it was um super fun and then I just went to sleep and I woke up and and I pissed off like there's like this is some asshole in Nashville this producer guy said I was a fat kid rock no he should be who she'll not be named oh really yeah do you have a thing with him uh kid rock Voldemort oh I'd love to piss off kid rock I'm not famous enough to piss off kid rock yeah those days are a dud that flat nose after me oh yeah the V said hey dude get a nose and come talk to me yeah you know what I mean like these are the kind of things that I would say to him totally yeah in any case so you smash that you went to sleep how many hours you get after doing SNL uh it's probably a short time because you're like out there partying till four probably no it was actually sad because they were like the after parties are normally really fun oh now we're just waving oh no it was sad can you imagine being a cast member during the pandemic and just starting the show right when the pandemic starts and you don't get to experience these cast parties can't imagine oh man what a terrible thing so you go to sleep you get you catch some Z's you go honks you honks you over and over again and then you wake up and there's there's uh the crosses after you because and what was the deal with him he didn't he didn't like the way you you uh he didn't like your technique I think he he thinks it's a disrespectful to the to the guitar two guitars and so you had to get it out there that you were no I emailed the company well also like who literally who gives a sorry can I curse on this yeah what words do you want to say uh sorry to replace shit do we replace shit on this show I don't know like well say shit and shoot so in case we replace shit with shoot just so we'll have it clean here we go comp yeah here we go um three two one I don't give a shoot thank you okay we'll we'll put that in earlier if in case I don't give a shoot about do you give a a fuck I don't give a fuck um it was neither a shoot nor a fuck nor yeah uh yeah it was it was it was amazing because I I

it really should 20 I saw a billboard that said 20 nominations can you want to know some stuff that don't have none that's so it's so weird while a one show has 20 does that make any sense me while

the little scissors yeah well it's two different words oh you spelled them the same love but they're not the same but they're too can you spell two different words the same i need to really think about this it feels like a trick like bird and bird two different words that's the same word but that's the same word can you spell two different words the same sure yeah you can what do you got we do in our language um I know there are words you know what no what about that you spell no that's two different words but they're spelled differently because it's kn o w and then those are homophones hmm

to talk about uh we've we've gotten your we don't know your age we you've dabbled in sex yes so where are you from I have the terminology the proper terminology for my experience and that's something

yeah exactly because you're a switch i'm first i'm first yeah we listened to the whole thing we did that was fun that was fun we both that was fun at the same time it was fun so i can understand yes tantential thinking it's tantential thinking 10 to 10th of the tensile thing did it though um so i why is Phoebe agreeing to be on this show other than she's just cool well i i knew her from the between two ferns movie she i didn't know her before that um mapernger from the national was asked to write a song for that movie and he said um oh you know who who i'd like to do a duet with is Phoebe bridges and i did not know her at the time and uh she showed up and did a really beautiful song in that movie uh great great uh part of that movie and so we got to know each other a little bit but i just kind of like randomly DM'd her out of the blue and was like hey do you want to do the podcast and she wrote me back immediately saying i would fucking love to is that what you wrote yes she did so uh and then uh she had a really good time and then she also think it was a live show at some point no i i forget if did we just hear that on the clip i can't i don't believe so uh we uh she got she got her dms confused she was DMing uh uh peat Holmes about doing his largo show right and um DM me and said like this is going to be a secret right no one knows i'm doing this yeah i was like well until it comes out and once it comes out i guess everyone will know but you do keep it a secret who is on the show before the episode comes out i do actually yeah uh i like to keep things a secret and just like once they're out they're out i don't like to give too much hype to things but you're a little you're a little devious little help well there's nothing better than having like a holy shit this person did it moment which uh you know like when we put out the the u2 episode where we actually got u2 on the show like that's a total that we kept that you know unlock forever and it was such a secret so i i enjoy giving people that feeling of like whoa holy shit do you think that people are like that when i'm on the show i think that everyone forgets that you do these best of so when they see your name on it they're like what yeah everyone let paul know that they on this episode in particular they can't believe that he was on it again yeah i'll take it yeah great but i will not this is not a you understood the assignment no no you will not respond you understood no you will never hear anything from me um and ego and phoebe had just done s&l together and so seven in and live that was a fun uh uh reunion for them and then drew drew is uh so funny doing that yeah that character turned around and a fun time that was in the studio uh together that was so that was during summer that was really fun and um i had a good time on that episode scott i'm glad to hear that thank you for once for what you've not been glad to hear that on the other episodes yes that's right huh in other episodes and you say after every episode i had a good time on this one i was never glad to hear until the sound okay i don't know why this time yeah i don't know i'm different maybe oh okay i'm a new guy so you'll be happy to hear it from now on i assume so okay great all right let's take a break take a break we still have so much more show to get to um we're cracking the top 10 when we come back it's got to be cracked and we're the guys to do it where the guys to do it when we come back we'll hear your choice for the 10th episode of the year we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this comedy bang bang best of 20 best of 20 22 no one one that is right we're not next year is watching you now what is that from till tuesday tuesday until tuesday where they have been as popular until tuesday what was i referring to have they ever said have they ever come out and said what that band name is referring to i think if i had to guess and i i'm surprised that i never asked was it about it's about wimpy and his hamburgers yes i will gladly pay you till tuesday for a hamburger today so wimpy was offering to face i will not pay you almost a week's worth of money for hamburger i'll pay you until all everything i have up until tuesday for one hamburger today i think it's a reference to a british expression hmm which is more or less like you would add it on it would be like something the equivalent of like till the end of time oh okay do this till tuesday let me eight days a week eight what if it what if it was eight days a week instead of purely just the five or ringo do you not know how long weeks are oh don't know what oh remember i'm just guessing he makes the one little vote when they're there in the hall of get back oh when he's like uh we'll gonna go up to the roof exactly what time he voices and they all go ringo you're adorable thank you ringo wants to do it we all do it they do they love him they love how could you not how could you not peace and love you want uh the people who don't love him are the people want him to autograph things that's right he told you he gave you a deadline uh why don't you talk i'll look up till tuesday all right i'm going to talk for a bit we're here counting down your choices and we're cracking the top ten this has never been done on this episode before cracking the top ten episodes it's never been done but we're about to do it we're about to uh tell you what the next clip that we're going to hear is and uh but before we do that paul has been furiously typing away with his fingers trying to find the genesis of the phrase till tuesday and he's i believe he's found it here's the first thing i've found i'm off until tuesday is present tense it usually means i'm off now and will be off until tuesday i'll be right tuesday is future tense uh it usually means that i will be off in the future but not now and we'll be off until tuesday fucking british people in october 2020 you mean yeah i get it till tuesday means you something's going to happen i mean that that not going to happen until tuesday all right well we'll figure this out and uh of course if you know the answer please don't send us any kind of messages about it um but uh paul you're ready to do it i know i'm ready to do it you can you can look it up during the clips but we're about to get to it we're cracking listen to the clips i know we're cracking the top 10 this is your episode 10 all right paul number one zero i think we have a 10 yeah of course okay i don't think there was a zero number zero a very wide area of just all over the place over a very wide area distance good luck escaping antluise she could talk from here till next tuesday till next tuesday though i don't know but that does make sense fucking oh what's the see you next tuesday all right paul yeah i mean hit you with some stats this is episode 600 and 88 we're in the 600s everything up until now or in the sixties hundred and eight eighths has been in the seven hundreds so this is before then this is before then shall i give you a date of course january 11th twenty twenty one yes so this is early in the year very early in the year almost as early as you can get probably the second episode of the year i think it's i think it's ten days shy of the earliest in the year you can be probably yeah i haven't run the numbers on this uh run them and crunch them my friend run them gun them and button i need those numbers run didn't crunch that runched in crunch runch them i was like that in a movie where people would rhyme things and he would not make any sense but it would sound official like i know in in die hard too they're like racum pacum and stackum gentlemen it's official stuff that's like serious business it's very same if you do all three of those and what he was talking about he was talking about maybe like hey go grab your guns out of your apartment i don't get your guns out of your apartment uh stack them on top of each other to make one super rack rack and put a rack in a rack of bullets okay or a rack of bullets please uh the lady will have a bowl and then you stack them on top of each other and that's very intimidating to anyone who wants to do you harm yeah when you see a stack of guns ooh that was old so fun even john mcclean blush john mcclean the maverick he should have been in the movie maverick can we go back and erase john can we go back and erase people you know how they erase kevin spacey yeah raise them at can we go back and did he erase that of anything he got erased out of uh all the money in the world we got replaced they had to first you erase didn't you replace did they have chris rr plumber on a green screen and they just shot all his shit yeah they didn't do reshoots no they they i think they did a couple of reshoots but every once in a while they just did them on a green screen but they did reshoots because uh mark wallberg uh wanted like a million dollars or whatever yeah because he was a dick yeah because they're like okay that's all you're contractually obligated to do reshoots anyway watch his documentary about his life as i did one night boy an explicable reason boy oh boy and then who did he produce this yes i'm going to assume there's one incident that was not mentioned in the documentary i'll have to yeah i'll have to ask you about that uh you have to he did go to uh wall burgers corporate uh offices and looked around and said why are there so many TVs here like he was he had never been first of all it's years into the business and he's like then he goes in the break room he's like why is there a tv in the break room why is there a tv in the break room people are just going to be watching tv when they should be working the break room yeah why aren't people working in the break room i have a revolutionary business concept people working on their breaks no one has ever thought of this before what do people's houses they're beds in the room there's full room i bed to the rooms just at bed today and some of the clothes you can't work any sleep can't work you say um all right you want to know the title of this yeah i mean i think i know what it is but give me what do you think it is i mean i know what episode it is oh okay but give me the title just for the health this is one called the sugar hill gang mues museum sugar hill gang museum is this ringing any bells fall course it is i remember this very well do you really nope okay let me tell you about it okay um this is uh two people and two alone this is eddie patterson and yourself and you weren't there no i was there yes i wish i wasn't there this was a zoom episode this was a zoom episode this is uh right when the the year started um i believe we had a guest who dropped out yes because they didn't have the proper recording equipment or they couldn't couldn't uh figure or like we we just couldn't figure it out we were on the zoom together and we were like we can't figure it out yeah and i was like let's just do one of the two of us yeah or the three of us rather than the two of you and myself and this was really funny eddie patterson people may know from uh the righteous gemstone she plays the one daughter in the family and it's so so funny on that and uh she is playing a character that she's done for a long time called bean dip bean dip and uh she's sort of my sidekick on this on this episode although i believe we did 20 minutes up at the top together just talking about bean dip and her weird stuff and then paul you are playing a character you can let us know who that is i would bet it's cal solomon it is cal solomon yes cal solomon explain explain uh what cal solomon's thing cal solomon is an older gentleman who uh says that he is one of the founding members of the sugar hill gang but when you get into it the legendary uh rap group from the 70s but when you get into his uh story it seems like he really wasn't yes he seems like a sad lonely person not even but cheerfully lonely he's that lonely yeah his life i guess his circumstances seem sad but he seems very upbeat about he's also very weirdly self aware that he knows he can't rap but he keeps trying to do it and he knows that he didn't quite fit in and that's fine with him yeah absolutely yeah absolutely he understands why he's not in the group sure uh but at the same time it hurts to be uh kicked out um and interesting fact uh i recently put together a cal solomon costume um because i'm doing these live shows again in los angeles and i'm doing some of my characters uh on them okay and i thought this would be a fun one to do live okay i got a i got a know what is in that costume but don't spoil it because people may be showing up to the show and wanting to see it for the first time but i won't spoil it but i will tell you this it was very it was there are pants involved there are he does wear pants he wears a shirt um it was more difficult let's just say fans of shoes will not be disappointed it was more difficult than i thought to find um uh sugar hill gang apparel okay in the year 2021 uh but i did i did i've put something together that that amuses me greatly and i think people enjoy it uh do you have one of those elo cool j bucket hats i thought about that and decided not to okay give the kangal um angle this is a really funny episode we'll talk about it a little more specifically but uh the title of the episode is what you're gonna hear the sugar hill gang museum let's hear it this is your choice for number ten number ten please welcome cal solomon hi everybody hi scott it's good to see you it's great to see you it's uh a happy new year may i be the first to say this to you uh you are not the first i'm sorry to say i've seen other people since uh the last time i saw you so yeah some other people have said it but you're still getting in there pretty early were people saying it to you last year i mean since the last time i saw you that was like five months ago some people did say happy new year when it was getting close to new yazive i didn't want to be the first i hate that they know i think just as a as a pleasantry and they knew they probably weren't going to see me between new yazive and the new year and so it sort of became like uh happy new year because the new year is coming up oh i see so like if i don't see you happy new year kind of thing yeah it's like a shorthand sure i understand speaking of short hands how big are your bad boys there hold them up to the camera if you could you know i have very long hands whoa those are real those are like etsi oh my god oh i never look down at your hands anytime we've ever done a show together i keep them hidden because i know they're distracting what happened how come it's got knobs on the end of the fingers just like et oh hey hello young lady my name is bean dip by the way cal solomon i've been dip it's nice to meet you hi cal nice to meet you happy new year happy new year to you dear short hand short hand so it looks like it looks like you have 10 of like umah thermon thumbs here's what it is are you talking about from that one movie no from all you know girl get the you know girls get the blues sure um my favorite tom robin's adaptation uh i have i do have very long fingers and they're so long that at the very tips another knuckle started to grow so is that does that come in handy at all is that a good thing i mean it's actually a hindrance in many ways because now you can bend your finger in i guess three different places well now it's just it's just the knuckle is right there and there's nothing to bend because it just stopped the tip it's at just a tip so where you're where are your fingerprints below the knuckle my fingerprint is below the the extraneous knuckle which makes it very difficult to operate anything like a touch screen you know things like that something that requires a fingerprint identification although although you can now probably not leave fingerprints on things when you're pressing buttons uh and murdering people i would imagine this is quite news well i mean i'm not so much of a murderer so it hasn't come in handy in that way have you ever have you done anything uh let's say sure i have okay but let me be a little more oh okay have you done anything in 2021 or 2020 sure i have okay but again i'm gonna narrow it down slightly oh okay i'm sorry i keep jumping the gun that you didn't want the police to know all right oh there was more wait you were gonna say sure after that you didn't want the police no i didn't i don't want the police um but uh no i'm cib of course i mean i'm a pretty american cucumber's a bountiful i'm a uh i'm a pretty i'm a pretty law-abiding guy you know i don't really get into too much trouble uh so uh you know the the having the fingerprints be hard to get on stuff hasn't been something that's worked in my favor yeah yeah i can only think of uh you know one or two examples of it being a bummer you know like uh trying to turn on your phone but uh i can be able to walk in yeah or maybe like when you're picking up food at a restaurant when i'm picking up food at a restaurant when you're picking it up like you got a to-go order you're not trying to get your fingerprints all over the to-go order that's true i know that's a pet pee for a lot of people when they go get the to-go orders and by the time they get at home it's covered with fingerprints yeah it's just covered with smudges nobody wants uh we need some sort of way to fix this don't you hate when you're taking your trash out and you use the wrap you have that nice oh boy i hadn't thought about that but this is quite akin to your previous wrap is it not have you ever been in your own house and you have to take the trash out i mean the bag is shiny it's it's the black and sleek and he makes you want to shout so you pick up the bag but don't don't you realize you got fingerprints all over the bag and now it's smudged and and it doesn't look like new anymore and it looks like trash which i guess is okay because it's the trash you're taking the trash out ah boy you lost it right there it got away got away from me so how long did you think you were in the group this is what i'm getting to did you go over to to one of their houses the next time they got together assuming that you were in it or what at what point did you find out you were not no i didn't really see any of those guys uh together or separately uh or even your neighbor i would see him i would see him like as he was going in and out the door you know what i mean but i didn't see him for any meaningful amount of time i gosh i hope not i hope not i would i would say hi one to mic um so at what point did you figure you you never saw them again at what point did you realize to yourself oh i'm probably not in this group was it when the record came out yeah i think when i heard the song in the radio and i said why does this sound familiar and then the more i went on the more i i you know i'm recognizing the voices one to mic big bank hank choreo to mr g and the rest um and then i realized like oh they made it a thing uh there there were a real wrapping group and i'm not in it and at what point were you listening to to like hip hop state i mean i don't even know if they had hip hop stations at the time but i guess it was played on pop radio or was it played on pop radio i heard it on top 40 radio wow yeah 40 and and at that point you're still living next door to wonder mic or i'm still living next door to wonder mic did you go over to his house and demand answers or what happened uh no i i did send him i slipped it i i did send him a note i slipped in under his door saying wonder mic congratulations i heard your song in the radio i'll never forget that great day at the barbecue the big bank hank threw at your home uh how much fun we had creating rap music so you were trying to get in you were right in a complimentary note but also you were trying to get in good care all right well i mean i didn't i don't try to be too devious about things but i wanted to leave the door open like if you wanted to record with me of course i'd love to record with the sugar hill gang but uh i didn't want to be too pushy about it but uh he moved about a week after that really did he put up a for sale sign like an hour after you left the note or not not an hour after i left the note but the next day so that was a quick uh it sounds like a quick close quick escrow yeah i mean i i chalked it up to i mean it was a great house i mean i'm not surprised i didn't want that quick well sure a three bedroom with the two and a half baths yeah but have you checked back in on Zillow with this house and seen do you still live there i still live in the same place so what are what are the houses in the area like what are they worth right now um what's it going to take to get you out of this house is what i'm oh i i'd like to buy your house it never occurred to me to check well was Scott why why do you want to buy my house don't you know sounds like a great area the sugar hill sugar hill is a great place to live i love it i've been living there all my life it never occurred to me to look at the prices of the houses i mean i i i did what what go ahead what's your question maybe i was about the answer did you inherit house or did you did you buy it i was about to say i inherited the house so i've never known what it cost and i've never known what the house is around me cost i don't you inherit it from cow i inherited it from my parents they had to cease now but when they were when they were alive they lived in the house and did they inherit it from someone like a millionaire who left them in their will or what or did they buy it yeah did they did they buy it or did they like get it from a vampire who died trying to think back my i don't remember hearing any stories like that so i would i would imagine they just bought it and didn't marry it from the vampire they didn't want to scare you hey that could be they were very loving parents so so the house has been in your family for gender well at least two generations two generations but decades yeah that's safe to say i'm decades old have they passed on at the time of the party or yeah they were gone by then yeah yeah kel will you get up given the house to anybody who you like well i mean i don't have any a's i'm not married i don't think right and uh and you know i i don't know who i'd leave the house to i mean what about the big bank hanks family to the to the best of my knowledge big bank hanks family is doing pretty good i think all the guys i ended up doing okay master gee kori kori oh um i i think that i think they're all right you know although in the streaming era you know maybe they could use some uh you know i mean you have to stream a song a thousand times for it to count as a as a sale you know i see i see this uh music business accounting i tell you you feel like uh the advent of streaming probably the sugar hill gang took quite a hit i think so they could maybe use some uh property hey you never know may oh i know what i could do what i could turn into the sugar hill gang museum that's how great i can have profit yeah oh yeah non-profit or for profit well i mean this is this is after i'm gone so i can make the plans now and it could be a non-profit thing it would just be a place uh in sugar hill where people could go and they could see the origins of the of the gang and uh i could have what would be in the museum would it be like i can only imagine a very large window overlooking uh uh wonder mike's backyard where it all goes down you gotta have that i maybe even want to knock out a wall to make the window even bigger you know so you can you can like it would be like you you're walking into uh an environment like a terrarium uh you know looking out and then you feel like you're a bug trapped in there that sounds great awesome so yeah what else could you i mean it's look if i already go to the sugar hill museum can i say something i'm really hung up on this idea of knocking out that wall and making it all glass so you feel like you're a terrarium a bug in a terrarium and if you can do it uh even without the museum idea well yeah i think what i want to do is just create an environment where people feel like they're bugs in a terrarium this sounds right yeah like a nature museum kind of thing instead of see if i were to go to a sugar hill gang museum and there was no gold record right no old furniture and all there was was a window overlooking somebody else's house can you imagine the disappointment if you show up to the sugar hill gang museum there's no old furniture i'd be so mad i i would think i'd drove across the country and there's no chairs there's no built-in television so i would be furious so instead do a nature museum idea where people can go inside feel like their bugs trapped in a terrarium right like sort of do a bug's life kind of thing you know get giant things and put them in your house giant things sure like a big shoe or something and cow you while people are being bugs in terrarium you could play sugar hill gang music and your music here's what i'm thinking first of all they walk in they think it's just a wa a nature museum with their bugs scott no i don't mean to shoot down your idea but i think a big shoe is the last thing you'd want to have in there when you try to make people feel like the bugs so i would have giant blades of grass i'd have like a big a big dime um how often do you think bugs encounter a big shoe though i would say more often than a blade of grass or a dime that a blade of grass got more than a dime they live in a grass uh they do live in the grass um so they go in the living room that's the that's the entrance and uh and that's uh so i have like uh uh you know like uh uh just a like that's pointed at them to say now it's time to shrink you down to bug size and then there's a noise like people people people people people people people and then i say now you're bug size when you go in the next room that's you're gonna be the size of a bug and then they walk in there and it's the blades of grass and it's the dime and um and maybe the show and no i i i i scott i i'm sorry i gotta put my foot down about this no pun intended i'm trying to stop stop trying to be the CEO of the insect class thank you bien there's saying i think i got i got to say the shoe doesn't feel right to me so if the shoe doesn't fit i must uh uh uh quid mitt and must admit i don't like it um if the shoe doesn't fit then don't add it to the bug museum class there we go that now that i can get behind so then there's like i do i record like a voice i was saying now you're a bug look around why not do it live well i'm just like bill o'Reilly would because i'll be i'll be all have passed on scott this is the fun because i thought that you were doing this while you were still alive no no no this is this is once this is when i this is my this is my legacy oh i is that uh when i die uh since i don't have any as to pass the the house on to um it will become this nature museum and a little surprise coming up yeah would you then on the voiceover introduce yourself as the the recently deceased cal solomon hello i'm the recently deceased well i wouldn't say recently i think that's gonna bump people out and i i might not mention that i'm deceased i might i might just say hi this is cal solomon one of the uh one of i thought the founding members of the sugar field game cal i know what you could say you could say hi this is cal solomon i am not deceased oh that was definitely no one would be bummed out by that wish bill though i feel like it would raise some questions like people might be saying why did he say that it makes me think he is he is deceased and he's trying to pretend like he's not number ten we listened yeah that was a good clip we listened to i liked uh i mean what i enjoy this kind of encapsulates what i enjoy doing about the show fun um which is none of the museum stuff was planned it always just like discovered in the moment and and just us saying like oh what if this what if that and the whole museum part of it came out and everyone sort of had their game like you know i had the big shoe stuff that i was trying to fit in there you know so any opportunity trying to get the big shoe thing it just is really like what i what i a free flowing conversation that's always funny never boring and includes big shoes and includes big shoes those are my three yeah i'm a foot guy i like things to be always funny never boring and have a big shoe i think you're gonna find that um for uh 2022 uh earwolf podcasts are all gonna be about feet because i'm a foot guy i've always said it it's fun to be a foot guy you can be right out front about it yeah it's not weird no it's not it's not private no it's it's something ever you know about i love fate um a little bit of trivia about this episode i don't know a little luck starring rek elman that's true do you remember what was going on in the world during this episode when we taped this episode i feel oh do you love us the date again well the date that it came out was january 11th yes okay so here's what happened we did this episode and from the we we taped it in the morning and from the half hour we spent trying to get the other guests stuff to work and it didn't work and um and then you know us taping and it was about a two and a half hour process of us being on the thing right and um when when i was taping at home uh and this was on on a wednesday i believe our gardeners usually come on wednesday and i have uh my uh co-worker i have them uh her communicate with them about when they should not be you know in advance like oh scott's taping from this time to this time so please don't do the uh the the leaf blowing and all that so because it took a little bit longer than necessary i had been texting during the show of like hey we're still taping we're still taping can they hold off and so she she had been texting me well let me know when you're done because they're waiting to go and so the minute we were done and we pressed stop on the zoom i texted and said okay uh we just finished and i got a text back okay i think you should turn on the news now and i said paul uh she's saying we should turn on the news and i've i've not asked you about the particulars of this and you said oh yes it appears there is a huge insurrection going on at the capital now had you been clocking that during the episode had you been watching out of the corner of your eye or had been someone telling about this janey uh was texting me because i was i was janey said they had a gun she texted me i think uh she started texting me right before um your co-worker was texting you okay and this is a mysterious stranger this is a very mysterious person that we don't want to name the baker so you were talking to the baker and i think like five minutes before my wife janey had sent me a couple texts like saying there's something weird is going on and then these guys like uh they have breached the capital it's not funny but uh the situation is fun what a wild text again like so crazy so crazy to be because we're so connected to our phones we're like anything weird happens we tend to know pretty soon yeah but but we put our phones away during when we do this and so it's just like crazy that for two hours we the the two hours it was happening we were out of commission yeah um but it also proves that we were not there that's true we have an ironclad alibi we do i like some people we know true look i was on mr shonen i'm proud to say i was not at the january six interacted and then we'll go around the room and we'll see who else can say such a thing who else can make the claim oh but that was really fun edie's so funny that was a ball yeah and that's just i was like listening to that clip it's so funny so uh great episode and calzaman also notably one of the characters that is very nice to scott yes one of your only your your characters are 99 of the time really annoyed with me and give me a lot of pushback sure and so it's always fun to have one on who's nice who's the one that likes you the least of my characters oh god i know who i think bubbles that's exactly right yeah big chunky bubbles yeah but he's mad at the world yeah he can't take it personally what's he been up you know we haven't heard from him in uh at least a year at this point i don't know he'll have to come back we'll have to come back we gotta have him guy he's got to come back all right but speaking of coming back we want you to come back because now we're going to be in single digits when we come back we have your choice for episode number nine we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this comedy bang bang yes sir rebob three bags full it's a lot of love i'd love to have three bags of wool would you miss a kind of i'd trade it for gas one gallon of gas we're practically there oh my god when you go past these gas stations you're like three bags of wool for one gallon thanks biden i had to fill my car up now i'm shivering well seriously when we get to the barter economy which is going to happen sure um well crypto hopefully before that oh god damn i just saw a thing a tweet where some artist was like yeah hey i just saw that my stuff was uh it being made in nft's yeah i can send and that they have to spend they could spend all day filing copyright claims yeah like people are just out there stealing people's artwork and making nft's out of it it's just what are we doing i want to see those nft's just maybe they're better than the ones i've seen which all look like shit yeah should this be an nft though what we're doing right yeah absolutely yeah of course

non-fudgeable token he saw it before anyone did all right let's get to it we're cracking the top ten ball no i mean we already cracked the top ten we're now in single digits we're continuing to crack it we're in single digits this is your choice for episode number nine number nine all right paul let me hit you with some some stats all right episode seven hundred and five so we're back in the seven early in the seven hundreds pretty early not as early as you can get no but like the mid seven tens probably closer to seven oh one than seven ten it's an interesting way to look at it you're a pessimist yeah i think i think um this is from may 10th 2021 okay may 10th this year springtime would have been one week after the anniversary show because the anniversary is always the first week in may and everybody's exhausted everyone's exciting and fucking yep from partying and fuck a lot of people don't know but the minute this show ends we just fuck each other we fuck hey are you missing some at the on the new just listen to us we like to fuck we like to fuck the fun podcasting podcasting i call that foreplay for fucking um yeah don't know don't know okay let me hit you with a title better call bed bath and beyond okay okay i think i know one person who was on this you should know two from that title well the one yeah okay i think i know two can i name them yeah name i'm gonna say babo denkirk babo denkirk babo was on this babo is on this mr denkirk himself yes and bob o well it's apostrophe it's o apostrophe babo denkirk babo denkirk oh and would you ever see babo denkirk on the silver screen um and lily sullivan not hard yes there you go you got them both also griffin newman is in this uh sure episode we're not going to hear his clip griffin sorry i know you're a loyal listener but we're not playing your clip on your little cuck he's a beta he knows he knows we won't there's a funny episode there's a funny episode i don't know if people are aware that i listened i'm a fan of the show i listen to the show every week every week every week i don't know maybe one or two i don't listen i understand um i look at the lineup not me i guess i'm past i mean there's i i let's do a good amount of episodes every year but not all um this is a fun one bob uh of course is uh our old friend from the aforementioned mr show which was a uh uh just uh breeding ground for a few things but gave us certainly our starts in show business for sure um and bob uh some might say and i would be chief amongst them that uh sort of a mentor to me in my early years in comedy and uh always uh on the comedy bang bang tv show showed up anytime i would ask him and uh had a very special part on the final episode uh which i wanted to make sure he was a part of and um he of course people know from better call salt where he plays uh i cal sal on the show that's right and uh he had a movie and you'll hear him talking about it a little bit uh movie called nobody which came out uh right around this time which is a great movie i believe it's coming to hbo max or something in a couple of weeks i almost seen it i really enjoyed that movie almost and watch it because of the title and i thought well no i'm somebody i should be watching this oh this is why you took it yeah like nobody should watch this i took i took it to me nobody's in the movie right and it would just be like pictures of empty fields yeah it's like i don't need that shit no why would you watch that but no actually he is in he's the only person in it he's the only person in it it's just him eating lunch they should call it one body one body of course uh after this bob had some troubles well documented troubles but it's true uh he seems to be okay now and we will probably he has a he was a gambling problem yeah and he was arrested and beaten in the face about the face he was beaten about the face let's be honest you we can't say we beat you in the face we beat you about the face uh but uh yeah so we're gonna hear him talk for a bit and then we're going to hear lily of course great comedian she is playing her probably her her most recurring character character uh francesca bolognese which is a fan favorite uh so let's hear this clip this is what you chose to be episode number nine number nine scott i i really um it was a weird thought that i could do this and i can't believe i uh no i i read an interview and look i don't just sit around reading interviews that you do bob don't get that impression you know like i i i could have just called you myself and asked you all these questions you have other interviews to read sure of course but i did read an interview about how this film got made you you took a look at how well the the tv show is doing in in foreign markets is that what it was yeah yeah and you said hey what if i made a movie that did well in foreign markets as well which are mainly action films because they they translate well and you just got it together and you did it yeah i mean it took a long time took years and uh i think i was more surprised by the fact that when i first suggested it note people didn't say you're crazy or that could never happen they most everybody who heard it the pitch which was basically that you know you know me from mr show and all this comedy that i did but around the world like nobody's seen any of that they've only seen tell me about it better call saw the post these kinds of movies and i play it in in especially in better call saw i play like an earnest guy who's like kind of devious and he's very earnest almost like earnest goes to lawyer school we wanted to call it earnest is nobody but there's some legal thing where you can't just use the earnest name the lawyer and you're you're a lawyer on that show couldn't you have like figured it out actually to become a lawyer in real life i have to do like 10 more episodes oh okay and then that will make me an official real lawyer oh you have to do you either have to go to law school and pass the bar or you have to do 60 episodes of a tv show that is based in the legal system in some manner all the people on night court are all lawyers and judges now um john larry cat represented me uh when i had uh mr mr mr mr mr mr yeah by the way she's uh lawyer she's a lawyer weirdly enough yeah yeah it's crazy and they just said you know what a misdemeanor is clearly that's your name you you clearly have a basis for legal thinking and thought and and the structures of strictures of legal law and we want you to please be a lawyer and missy mr mr edley it said please thank you i would love that that's very honored to be me and i appreciate you and and the together together they came to an agreement where they came to an agreement that's why at the supreme court right now there's only one justice missy mr mr edley that's right so uh she's a social media expert please welcome back to the show francesca bolan hazy hi uh no scott i'm not a social media expert you always get it wrong with your team i don't know who had your team say the wrong thing but i am not a social media expert i i beg your pardon i don't have a team necessarily as much as uh your big team of people that you work with they get it wrong every time i come on look i know that i have 20 people standing behind me right now but they they don't work on the show they're just watching so i am not a social media expert and i know last time i come on i work for a bit better beyond in a best by beyond i don't work for them anymore scott i got a new job you have it as as Rudy north said you have a new job i have a new job yes this is incredible bob i don't know if you uh have ever listened to the show before i'm doubting uh that you ever have but francesca here uh she what would you do you were working for bed bath and beyond and you would go on to instagram posts that they would post and argue with the clients is that is that essentially what it was let's say somebody comment on a picture on like um i don't know twitter of uh bed bath and beyond product and they say oh i went to bed bath and be young and i buy myself a vcr and inside the vcr i find a lot of little hairs well that for me then i commented no you a piece of shit why you not take your vcr go uh sink to the bottom of a pit of mud and a die but so i get fired for that wait you got fired i thought you got hired for that i thought that's what they wanted you to do no they didn't know that i was doing what i was doing oh no when you confessed it on this podcast well yeah so but mostly because i comment on um the bed and body work bed and body work a post and i say why you not take your body wash cucumber scented body wash shove it up your stupid body in a drown with the body wash in your body till you die no so you're not only responding to complaint posts that people do for your own company bed bath and beyond but you're out there trying to snipe other companies and tear them down yes and i saw then uh bed and body work they sue a bed bath and beyond and then they fire me and i said what do you want me to do where am i supposed to go yeah yeah when people are fired you should be given like where you should go a different job yeah yeah you should be your fire from here but now walk down the street it's like take a penny leap a penny like right you know get fired you know but also you get hired here yeah that didn't happen and that didn't happen no that they didn't happen i have a son i have a son in the what when did you have the son before you never talked about this did you there's this news do you just have a baby no no no he is um he's 17 years old i had him for a long time you just had it how long have you had it about 17 years i got him i got him about

obviously but Francesca you've never mentioned your family i've never even brought it up i apologize you've been fired because you willfully and on your own offered critiques of some of the commentary on social media of other business company you were trying to defend your company and then you started making snipey comments about you you are almost a lawyer bob well i think the word the term snipey comments gives it away of course i've obviously studied for the bar what would sal say about this i can settle it for you just give me a lot of money and i'll lie yeah it sounds about right that guy that that care wow now listen what are you gonna do what are you gonna do you have a son you have a husband he's neither of them this is what yeah so what are you gonna do no that's us asking you what are you gonna do you can't just say yeah so i say you can just agree with it i say what do you want me to do he says uh he says uh you know what the bedbeth and beyond open uh high school in the chicago why no go work for the high school what wait bedbeth and beyond open to high school so it's like it's like branded a branded high school yes everything bedbeth and beyond really this is incredible i mean i i wonder i've always wondered bob and i'm sure you have why don't more companies open high schools you know what i mean like subway okay it's a sandwich shop but why don't they open a high school uh this i don't know scott i i people just have a well there's a dearth of imagination yeah in some of our uh board rooms so they opened a high school in chicago and they said why

bit of like and so when they when i heard they're like no no you don't understand it'll go at least three and a half to four hours i was like oh no i will be saying that i need to leave i think i did

why don't you both come on but the only thing is is like after two and a half hours i think i don't have anything more to say to george luka's motto so can you play something else and so they played

google phy this is song too this is so beautiful yeah i love these lyrics hello built in vp and i think this is almost as good as the jill scott nationwide insurance commercial song almost as good as seriously this is about as good as piano we're not we're not fucking around anymore this is as good as joe billie joe's piano man like this is about the level of quality of piano man isn't it you know i think the automatic is a good song actually i do i i love billie joe obviously billie joe i billie joe is somebody that i think a lot of people that that our our age maybe like well because of their nose up at and because of his late 80s career yes but but but will you agree ads will you agree that lifetime vpn is just as clunky of a lyric as making love to his tonic and gin lifetime vpn that was one of the lyrics on that song you just oh just played they're about equitable are they not well at least lifetime vpn if it was if it was vpn for lifetime i would say it's as clunky as tonic and so piano man is more clunky yeah sorry bill sorry will you sorry bull i'm not even gonna give you the lead exactly sorry boo who's playing bull on the new night court oh i like the bass sound familiar in a general 80s way not really i mean it sounds like a tv theme song it does sound like a tv theme song making a way in the world today takes everything you got taking a break from all your worries sure

from a life on the range so there's observations but there's also a third thing that you write which is titles yeah titles that's true i wrote that title all by myself some people say to me you must have had help it's so long i said a ghost writer and you don't want a ghost writer right i'd never have a ghost writer terrified of a ghost right i mean if you if there was a ghost around dalton i i seem to remember you having a real problem with the things of supernatural nature frankenstein uh werewolves vampires i'm assuming ghosts falls into this category my friend it'd be more accurate to say that they have a problem with me because when i show up they've got a problem it'd mean that i'm gonna kill them oh thank you for explaining that i was there problem is that you're going to kill them i went before he said that i was like what kind of problem would they have that i mean is they've got a problem with me in their problem they've got a problem with me and it's that i've got a problem with them oh this is like a snake eating another snake that's eating its own tail at this point i've seen that many times is that what you say to them right before you kill them i say to them

fast and furious it the only reason it's in front of Hobson shaws because Hobson Shaw isn't called fast and furious no in the billboards though wasn't it John Wick presents f9 John Wick had nothing to do with the TikTok man book talks TikTok mr.
