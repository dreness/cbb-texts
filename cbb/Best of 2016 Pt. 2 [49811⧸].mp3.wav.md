Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

I don't know what that is referring to, but thank you to Pam Greer's Legs for that.

Hey, uh, Pang, you tend to do a different part of her body.

Congratulations.

Yeah, I guess.

Hey, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Hey Greer's Legs.

Two minutes later!

This is what we do!

Big fish, what we do!

Welcome to the show. This is Scott Ockermann and, uh, Cross for me is good ol' PFT.

That's right, everybody.

That's right.

Paul F. Tompkins.

It's the Paul F. T.

He's back.

This is Best of Comedy Bang Bang 2016, part two.

And over these episodes, we are counting down your top 15 episodes of the year that you have voted on.

You.

You, the listener, have typed in your choices and you got to pick ten and we have compiled all those votes.

You did it.

And we're counting down your top 15 and not just your top 15 normal episodes, but your top four live episodes of the year as well.

That's a little wrinkle on the countdown.

And this is number two of those.

On the previous episode, we counted down 15 through 12.

Yes, we did.

And four through four.

Four through four of the lives.

What do you think we're counting down this time?

I think it's gonna be, uh, first of all, it's 15 through 12?

Uh-huh.

I'm gonna say this is gonna be 11 through 10.

Oh, that would only be two episodes.

Right.

So no, this is a word.

We are gonna do those, but it's gonna be 11 through eight and three through three.

Okay.

That's right.

We're gonna crack the top ten very, very soon.

See the TT?

Yeah, that's right.

Scott, Scott, Scott.

Yeah.

Let me ask you.

Go ahead.

What do I give a shit if you ask me something?

Yeah, I don't care.

Go ahead.

Oh, you sound like you're protesting a little bit too much.

I mean, me thinks.

I'm not hiding anything.

You go ahead and shoot.

I'll take any question.

Okay.

Now you really sound like you're hiding something.

I'm hiding.

What could a guy like me possibly be hiding?

I don't know, but you're so...

I'm an open book.

I've lived a good one.

Are you an alien?

Yes!

We're both aliens!

We're both aliens.

Why have we talked about this before?

God damn it!

Oh.

We're from the same planet, do you think?

Well, hold on.

Let's see.

What's your planet like?

Gorblox 5!

Gorblox 4.

Oh, so close.

Yeah.

I hate Gorblox 5.

When you ask me what it's like, it's like that.

Oh, it's like...

It's like...

From Gorblox 4.

Oh, okay.

Oh, great.

We love each other.

Haven't you ever noticed how much it's like Gorblox 5?

It's so much alike, and yet I hate them.

Isn't that interesting?

Oh, I want to destroy them.

And Earth.

Hey, I'm right there with you, buddy.

How did you...

How did you feel about the first best episode that we just did?

How did I feel about our banter or about the...

Well, just overall.

Overall, I thought A+.

You know what?

We talked about Star Wars.

We talked about Bill Cosby and the peanut.

That parable?

The parable of...

It reminds me of the parable of Bill Cosby and the peanut.

The peanut.

I would love that if 300...

nay, a thousand years from now, people talked about that parable much like, you know, Damocles sword and all that.

That's something, right?

Yeah.

It's something where Damocles had this sword.

He kept it on the ceiling, and then he was like, mmm, mistake.

Let me get out from under this thing.

Is it the Gordian knot?

The Gordian knot, yes, of course.

Yeah.

Impossible to untie, unless you just cut that shit in half.

Yeah.

That, to me, that is instead of a big lesson about how to solve problems, that's like the first guy who decided to be smart.

No one thought to cut this thing till then.

Yeah.

That's a...

You got a brace of rules, right?

I guess, but that's like, now we're all so smart.

If there was a knot you could barely untie, you'd spend like 30 seconds trying to untie it, and then you'd get some scissors, right?

I mean, it depended on what you...

If it was like your shoes?

Maybe not scissors, yeah.

Well, maybe you would say, if you had backup laces, you'd be like, I'm just going to start from scratch.

How many backup laces do you keep at your house, by the way?

I have...

It's not a steamer trunk, but it's like a mid-sized suitcase filled with shoe laces.

Just filled with laces, and are they packets of laces that are bunched up so where you can just loose laces?

Like, they're probably all in knots, frankly, and it's a mess.

Wow.

Yeah.

So I got a take of those.

Are you a hoarder?

Well, I mean, I don't think so, because I think I need a lot of pill bottles.

I need pill bottles, newspapers, CADS skeletons.

Oh, God.

A lot of animal deaths.

I need them.

A lot of animal deaths on these episodes.

A lot of animal deaths.

How do you feel about the last episode?

Well, hold on a second though.

There's so many animals, I mean, fuck it.

Come on.

So some of them die in theoretical conversations.

Sure.

We're not actually doing it.

Wink, wink.

Yeah.

We're not even in conversations.

They're theoretical.

Yeah.

I feel like that last episode, the last best episode.

You could be honest with me.

Go ahead.

I think it was the best thing I've ever done.

What?

The best thing you've ever done.

Better than even these episodes that we're counting down right now.

Oh, way better.

That is high praise.

You have had what a career you've had.

You started out in Philadelphia as a stand-up comedian.

In Philadelphia, I was born and raised.

You then traveled to Los Angeles where you worked upon shows like Mr. Show and others.

Yeah.

That's right.

Not necessarily the news.

That's right.

Oh, and real time at the Bill Maher where you started the clock.

You were the first person to start the clock.

They made me, you know what?

That was humiliating.

They made me start the clock.

So when he said start the clock, he was actually yelling at you.

Yeah.

That's like having your boss yell at you.

Yeah, and no one even got to see me on camera.

Start the clock.

That's you start every single episode.

Until when you hear that clock?

Yeah.

I started it and they still make me do it now.

I'm not even getting paid.

Although would you rather a robot did it?

You know what I mean?

Well, I'm the head of Carl's Jr.

Yeah, exactly.

I didn't know robots made all of those burgers and all of my boners when I watched their commercials.

It makes sense now though.

You think about it?

It does.

Like you think like, oh yeah, I got wrecked when I was watching that commercial.

A robot.

All right, Paul, we're going to count them down.

Here we go.

We're going to count them down.

Here we go.

We're going to count them down.

Here we go.

We're going to count them down.

Here we go.

By the way, we're going to count them down at the end of the end.

You were trying to talk to me, but you also wanted to sing along.

I wanted to sing along.

Yeah.

We're going to count them down.

By the way, we're going to count them down at the end of the episode.

We're going to count them down.

Have a big surprise.

We're going to count them down.

And we're going to count them down at the end.

Why don't we get to it?

This is your episode number 11.

Number one.

Okay.

This is episode number 11.

We're going to count them down.

We're going to count them down the end.

Why don't we get to it?

This is your episode number 11.

Number one.

Okay.

This is episode number 11.

I'm a really love a man.

Hey, 19.

Not queer, but go.

By the way, someone on Twitter alerted me to something which made me think, you know that song, Hey, 19.

Do you think we talk about it?

Every year.

Do you think that it actually was the latest song in a song cycle that Steely Dan had been writing about our American presidents because Rutherford B. Hayes was the 19th president and its original title was Hayes 19.

Yeah, I do think that.

Okay.

That's all I want to do.

Hayes 19.

It's exactly what I think.

The 19th president.

You're the little one about you.

All right.

This is why we were talking about hate 19 because I don't remember.

It's just always on the edge of our brains.

That's true.

Now, episode 12, which we heard on the last best of episodes, that was from February 8th and that was episode 400.

Would it surprise you to know?

Is this a feeling this is going to be a word problem?

Yeah.

How fast does the train go?

No, this episode is episode 401 from one week later, February 15th.

It's right.

So wait a minute.

Back to back.

B to B.

Uh huh.

I mean, these are some good episodes.

These are some good episodes right in a row.

That's right.

For 401, love is thicker than water.

That's right.

Right around Valentine's Day.

Valentine's Day.

That's right.

Is it Valentine's Day?

It's the time of year for Valentine's.

I had no, I've been calling it Valentine's.

Valentine's.

Wait, it's the time of year for Valentine's.

That's right.

So Valentine's are a thing.

They call it Valentine's.

You give each other Valentine's on Valentine's Day.

You can see me mistaken on this.

No, I doubt I am.

This is the Valentine's Day episode.

Came out on February 15th.

And this is of course Paul Rust, Gillian Jacobs and yourself.

I want this.

You're on this.

This is for the second year in a row, maybe the third even.

Gillian Jacobs returns.

And we did an episode together.

The previous year was Colin Hayes.

That's right.

And this is Gillian Jacobs and she and Paul Rust are on a show called Love on Netflix and they were promoting its premiere.

And Paul, you were playing Alan Thicke who was coming into Gillian and trying to romance her.

Mm hmm.

Romance and depends.

Depants.

Oh man.

Have you ever depanced anyone?

By the way, oh man.

It is something that is good.

I mean, I like to do it.

Depants thyself woman.

All right.

Sometimes I'll be like, let's get to depends.

Two guys who have never had sex and don't know what it is.

So Paul, right off the bat, you're on the countdown here.

You're in the first episode.

Right off the bat, man.

Right off the bat.

Why don't we hear it?

Oh, the bat, the batting gentleman.

He's so scary.

Oh, he strikes terror into the hearts of criminals.

Oh, I'm cowardly and superstitious.

So you're a part of that lot that is?

Yeah.

So I heard that there was this giant bat that was, that was funny.

He was punishing pick buckets and personality.

That's right.

We need to think about it, by the way.

He's picking up the bat man.

Bat man is a rich guy who goes out there and knocks heads around of poor people who are just like trying to make ends meet and sure they're crimes.

Yeah.

He's like a rich guy beating up poor people.

Yeah.

That's right.

Great stuff.

Yeah.

Because not everybody, not everybody was a crazy, costume villain.

In the early days of Batman, he was just straight up beating up.

He was just straight up beating up.

And he was just straight up beating up.

And spending his millions and now billions, if not trail, of dollars.

Just buying cars in order to beat up people.

Do you think Batman is a trillionaire?

Even, you know, if Lil Wayne is now, you know?

Why not Bruce Wayne?

Yes, that's right.

Sorry to blow up your spot, Batman.

When, by the way, when Bruce Wayne heard Lil Wayne, did he think that everyone was talking about himself when they were like, I love Lil Wayne?

And he thought they were being very dismissive of him.

Like not, it's not very respected.

And they were talking about how he was drinking lean.

Did Bruce Wayne think it was himself?

Do you think Bruce Wayne drinks scissor?

I think he might.

It's the only way to keep himself up all night.

Right?

Fashion these heads.

Doesn't it make you sleepy, though?

Scissor?

Scissor at might.

I don't know.

I'm not a huge fan.

I'm a big fan.

You'll do it socially.

But you won't.

All right, look, we got to listen to this episode.

This is your episode 11.

Number one.

Now we can actually do the real reason you came on the show.

Paul.

Oh, the nip nip nip nip.

That's right.

Paul likes to come on the show and he has a feature that he likes to do called the nip nip nip.

No, go ahead and set this up.

It's called New Know-Nos.

Oh.

Are you?

I've done it, I think, a couple times in the show.

You're done.

It's a huge.

Sure.

And maybe, well, it's based on a, Bill Maher has a segment called New Rules.

And I guess- He's exhorting people to do.

Yeah, Mr. Maher takes- Exorting?

Is that right, Paul?

Yeah, it takes some gripes that everybody- Paul Russ, of course.

Yeah.

Bill Maher, he'll take some gripes that everybody has.

Something we all have to deal with.

And he kind of, he does an irreverent suggestion about how to solve this problem.

He's, I mean, he's more than suggesting it as far as I'm concerned.

He's dictating it.

If he were ruler of this land, these would be laws.

God hope.

President Maher?

2020?

Maybe 2020?

Or maybe VP of 2016?

Oh, that'd be awesome.

With Trumpy.

Yeah, Trump and Maher together.

Trump Maher.

So, we've established what new rules are at this point.

There's been a, I felt, Mark could push this further.

He's snotty, but I'm snotier.

He's cheesed off, but I'm even more cheesed off.

You're cheesier.

So I do a little segment called, new, no, no, start the clock.

Start the clock.

Good afternoon.

Afternoon.

Time will be real.

You know, no.

Snowing right now.

Oh, over this globe.

Everybody's inside.

It's cold.

I'm sick of snow.

You guys all sick of snow?

Yeah.

How about this?

How about we split up when it snows?

What?

Yeah.

It gets snow November, December.

But let's take the snow in January and February.

Move it to June and July.

Yeah.

No, no, no.

It's snowing on the 4th of July.

Not really a no, no.

That's more of something you want to change.

Do do.

Yes, do do that.

Okay.

All right.

Number two.

Oh, no, no.

Where's E.T.

Part two?

Hollywood is so caught up in making original material.

They haven't gone back to the big boss himself.

E.T.

I want E.T. in a sequel where he plays a chef who is short tempered.

No, no, no.

E.T.

Got burnt.

Oh, I get it.

Yeah.

No, no, no.

You guys ever have to deal with these Uber drivers?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, man.

I love them.

They drive me every, but hey, let's make a little deal here.

Okay.

Uber drivers.

Okay.

For every mile that you drive me forward, I'm going to get in my car and drive a mile backwards.

You're going to get in your own car?

Yep.

I'll keep a record.

And if I see, you drove me six miles forward.

Next time I'm in my car, I'm going backwards.

Reverse.

Not even N.

No, no, no.

I'm backwards, baby.

Okay.

Let's do more.

No, no, no.

Libraries.

Yeah.

Libraries.

Thank you.

I'm sorry.

But how many books does one place need here just needs two favorite books as far as I'm concerned.

My two favorites.

The Pelican Breeze by John Grisham and the Caran.

That's all you need libraries.

No, no, no.

Dewey Decimal.

Do it right, man.

No, no, no.

That one may be qualifies as a no, no, no, by the way.

If you were to say it as no, no, no's, library stops stocking these books.

You're saying like the people should stop doing things.

I'm trying to be in the affirmative.

You've forgotten how to do these.

Okay.

Here's what.

I said this last time.

Here we go.

I know how to do it.

Okay.

All right.

No, no, no.

I can't find a cute top to wear to my nephew's birthday party.

No, no, no.

I need a cute top.

You don't remember.

No, no, no.

Lucky horseshoes.

You ever hear about these people?

Oh, I got a horseshoe.

I got a horseshoe that's lucky.

Okay.

Hold on.

We got to start the clock again.

Start the clock again.

Yeah.

That means it's going fast that I'm keeping a good pace that we're cycling through it twice.

Yes.

Hey, horseshoes.

Okay.

If they're lucky, then why don't you ever hear about a horse winning it big in Vegas?

Do no, no.

I'm riding a horse through a casino tonight.

Do no, no.

You ever walked down the street and you see a dog peeing on the fire hydrant?

Oh, the time.

Oh, what do these dogs got against fire?

Hey, dogs, if you don't like fire hydrant so much, next time there's a fire, you put it out with your pee pee.

No, no, no.

Fire department's Dalmatians pee on the fire.

That's sort of cool.

Does that work?

Sort of.

Yeah.

I have some more.

No, no, no.

What's with these caps people wear on graduation?

You got the flat top and the tassel.

Yep.

No, no, no.

Those caps need to be made of tassels and they're not flat.

They're bumpy.

No, no, no.

Bumpy tassel hats now.

No, no, no.

Can we just call sexting what it really is?

Horny texts.

Two left here now.

Wait, that was it?

That was it.

Okay.

No, no, no.

You know how I was talking about the 4th of July earlier.

We mentioned it earlier.

Yep, yep.

Why do they have to shoot them up into the sky?

Shoot what up into the sky?

Fireworks.

Ah, right.

No, no, no.

They should shoot fire, blast them into somebody's house.

Mm.

Oh, oh, oh.

No, no, no.

Look out daycares.

Fireworks are blasting through your window at 8 a.m.

On 4th until 8 a.m.

I got them.

I got one last window.

All right.

I got one last.

Because I would say approximately 60% of these.

I've got qualified.

Here we go.

That I've been doing for years.

Yes, you should know by now.

No, no, no.

You know that song, they say the neon lights are bright on Broadway.

Algiro, sure.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

From all that jazz.

I'm sorry, but when I go on Broadway, I'm not thinking of the lights.

OK, I think the song should go.

The say the plays are really great on Broadway.

No, no, no.

Lights are bright in Vegas, man.

Were you riding your horse?

Yeah, no, no, no.

It's 2000.

16.

16, right.

OK, should we stop the clock now?

Stop the clock.

OK, wow.

Sorry, Bill.

You're apologizing.

Get your heart out, Mr. Maar.

I'm pretty sure he remembers how the new rules go, though.

Well, that's fantastic.

I think that it's.

Oh, the doors.

Excuse me.

Pardon me.

What's wrong with the door?

The door is stuck.

I can't quite close it.

Oh, God.

Oh, hey.

Hello.

Hello, everyone.

Oh, my gosh.

Scott, hello.

How do you do?

Paul, Russ, you must be a fan of this gentleman.

You fan of Alan from Big Pains.

Oh, thank you.

The Pains.

Growing pains.

Don't call it pains unless you've been there.

I mean, I watch the talk show in the thick of the night.

Well, that's very nice to hear.

Thank you very much.

Always, it's nice when young people are familiar with thick of the night.

Well, my parents would tuck me in every night.

We'd watch it.

Oh, and then you'd watch it together in a big bed, like Charlie and the chocolate factory.

We had our names carved on the headboard.

It's very bleak.

Sit according to that.

But thank you for being a fan.

Of course, my sitcom, Growing Pains.

And of course, you're familiar with my work as a theme song writer.

Yeah.

Sure.

I would love maybe you'd like to write a theme song for Paul Russ over here.

I mean, he's a personal theme song for you.

Personal theme song.

Or for his personal theme song.

Or for his show.

He's got a show coming up.

Oh, congratulations.

It's great to have shows.

You know, I have a show, a reality show that airs on one of those reality show networks.

It's called.

It's monstrously thick.

It's now Scott.

We have a lot of fun with the title.

But of course, it's painfully thick.

It's about me and one of the women that I married.

Do you have a theme song for the show, Love?

It's just got music.

It doesn't have lyrics.

No lyrics.

Yeah.

OK.

Are you a lyricist or a composer?

Hello, Gillian.

Hello.

I've been a calendar year since the last time I've seen you.

Anyway, I am a composer and a lyricist.

Of course, I wrote the words and the facts of life, although I had inspiration from the title, of course I didn't come up with the title.

No, but the facts of life are things that you probably have.

I would have called it.

Yes, bunch of girls.

One on skates, got the OV in there, bunch of girls.

Bunch of girls.

There's one on skates, one's a Christian.

One is deaf.

One is a Christian.

I think she became a Christian later.

I don't think she was a Christian on that show.

That was not the character you were talking about Blair.

Of course.

Blair was just an sort of uptight rich girl.

She was not necessarily a Christian.

It wasn't overt.

I mean, she may have been a Christian on the show.

She may have been.

But you know, of course, I had to watch every episode because we would do the theme live.

Sure.

Yeah.

I don't think you would just stick around to watch the episode.

Oh, I know.

It's fun to be there at craft service.

So she never- A lot of bugles on that set.

Yeah, boy.

Same with- You could put bugles on your fingers and make yourself into a witch.

Interesting.

Same with the Spiderman set.

There were a lot of bugles on that one too.

Or one of note.

So even Gillian got that one.

So what- That's the paper.

It feels it last time we were together.

There's a lot of Spiderman talk as well.

I don't remember.

You were making fun of me because I didn't know about some issue of Spiderman where- What did you want number 42 where Mary Jane was introduced?

No.

With the eye.

Web?

Oh, with this ring-id-the-web, of course.

Yeah.

When Doc Ock married Aunt May.

Of course, that was before I arrived on the scene.

Yeah.

So I wouldn't know that anyway.

So sing a song about love.

Love.

What is the show about?

Give me some background.

Yeah, try to do a better job than you did early.

I realize now that we should have- We don't have to know.

We don't have to sell this show to you.

This is a show that is insellable.

It's insellable.

Well, just for the help of the song, I play somebody who's sort of a uptight.

He plays Gus, by the way.

People, pleaser.

Can I stop you?

Can I stop you right there?

Uh-huh.

Are you the main character of the show?

I'm one of the main characters.

I'm one of the main.

Is it an ensemble piece?

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, it's kind of a two-hanger.

That's what that's- Is it- Are you talking about that scene where you jerked off?

That's what you mean for a country-able effect.

You know about it.

We're all racing to get our joke in.

That's more of all one-fister, open-palmer.

One finger in the butt-holer.

What are we talking about?

What a shocker.

So, that's my character.

Hey, now I'm pointing to you.

Gilly, and she plays Mickey.

She's sort of a wild child.

The second hand and the two-hander.

Yes.

Is it M-I-K-I or is it- what is it?

M-I-C-K-E-Y-M-O.

Why didn't you write that song?

USC.

Why didn't I write that song?

That's a good question.

Why didn't I write the other songs I didn't write?

Do you think time prevented you?

The where you were born in New York?

Yeah, the very time prevented me from- I'm writing those songs.

That reminds me of something.

I don't know what it is.

I'm sure I don't know.

Okay, so he plays Gus.

She plays Mickey.

Well, what's the show about though?

Don't tell me- Are you Canadian?

Of course I am.

From Toronto.

So don't tell me, show me?

What are you- what are you about to say?

Well, I need to know what the show is about not just the characters.

Does the show me stay?

Well, these two characters, could you imagine if they got together in a Atlantic relationship?

They're opposites.

They're kind of opposites.

They're different.

Yes.

Not so much made December.

Whose idea was this?

Not mine.

Very, very new.

You're already washing your hands of this.

We thought it would be cool.

I had nothing to do with this.

We thought there might be a show of two identical people dating each other.

Two people who jibe on every level conceivable.

Zero conflicts.

The first time they ever talk, they have all the same references and like all the same things.

They're politically they're like- Emotionally.

They're religiously- Yeah.

Should say- Background.

Background.

They both- Backgroundally.

They're from the exact same house in the exact same city.

The brother and sister.

They meet by the first of them by the second they're married.

There was a show about a brother and sister who fell in love recently on television.

It was written by Neil Labute and I don't remember what it was called.

In the company of Sibylin's.

Oh my god.

Do you guys ever act like this on the show or you actually like normal people?

No, it's all this.

Oh, are the people mentally ill?

Sure.

I mean you could argue that all of us are in some way.

Yes.

Some respect.

Well our brains are rotting in our heads.

The further and further we get to death.

Closer and closer we get to death.

That was the original title.

Oh did I say further and further?

Further from birth.

Further towards death.

Closer towards death.

No, close it you're right of course.

The further we go from our mothers.

The Jaina's that birth does.

Really do you think life is all about trying to get as far away from your mother's vagina as possible?

So you're on the exact opposite of the earth from it.

And then you die the minute you hit the exact opposite.

Yeah what your completely.

Is this what the show was about?

The boot.

Oh I'm sorry you're from Toronto.

Toronto.

Well I live in Toronto now of course.

You do?

Some.

Yeah.

I divide my time between.

I have several homes.

How does that work?

What tax purposes wise is it tough.

Pretty good.

We looked it up the last time about a year ago I think it was.

Is it exactly a year ago?

Almost to the day.

Wow that you were on the show.

We looked up at how rich you are.

Very rich.

You're pretty good.

Well was it was like 35 mil or something?

I think you're doing me into service.

I'm so sorry.

It was 60 million dollars.

60 mil.

And Gary.

Gary had 80 mil.

Not as much as I thought he'd have.

I thought he'd be more wealthy.

Well he's just a director.

Isn't he a show creator?

He also created shows.

There's a lot of money in that of course.

Paul told us about that.

A lot of money in creating love.

Cha.

Hold on a second.

Oh yeah he wasn't done.

Paul you were the creator of this program?

A co-creator.

Who is your other creator?

My wife Leslie Arfin.

Okay.

And Judd Apin.

You didn't know about this?

I didn't know they were married.

How long have you been married now son?

Father?

Father thick?

Well I'm certainly older than you are.

Paternally thick?

Turdly thick.

You know I am a father.

My son Robin is a very famous singer.

Yeah very famous.

Play-dressed.

Anyway.

Well now.

Well I don't want to get into thick water here.

He was just an homage.

I love being married since October.

He's soggyly thick.

And how was the wedding?

Did you have fun?

Oh it was beautiful.

It was a beautiful wedding.

The weirdo showed up to him.

Was that?

Oh no.

Party Crasher.

That is the absolute worst thing you can do is to show up to someone's wedding that you weren't invited.

Hey not if you're a winner Vince.

Yeah that's true.

Boy worked out.

I love those guys.

Well that was fiction of course.

And the whole point of that film is that it's a thing you don't do.

Well um.

Theme song for love.

Do you have enough info?

So it's about opposites who they fall in love.

Maybe.

We don't even know if they fall.

There's ups and downs sometimes.

So it's called love and then people.

And it's all about people.

People in this series not having.

They are not in love.

They just coexist in the world.

There's ups and downs sometimes they miss you know there's they can't connect.

Ask connections.

Yeah I know what to say miss connections because it's kind of like Craigslist.

Did they have that?

Yeah.

They do.

Yeah.

Also if you're German you can get someone to chop your penis off and cook it in front of you.

I don't care man.

Are you?

Can't be.

Something you might want to look into.

Can we talk more about that?

Sure.

German craiches.

Do you want to do a theme song for that by the way?

I'll do that one.

Okay let's hear it.

What five six seven eight.

You don't want your dick but you want to eat it.

Come down to the dick hut.

We'll chop off your dick and cook it right up.

You can eat it in front of your mom.

Once you get it as far away from your mom's vagina you can die but you can't die with your dick attached.

Come on down to the dick hut.

Nice.

Wow what do you think now?

Alan has a theme songwriter.

Well I have to say that fell more into the...

That fell more in the realm of jingles than theme songs.

Because that sounded like a jingle for a...

This is a brick and mortar establishment as opposed to an ad in German Craigslist.

You think it was brick and mortar?

It was not an online business.

If you come on down...

That's true.

Come on down to amazon.com.

Although if I could go to the warehouse and just pick the stuff up that would be better.

Do you think it would be like Raiders of the Lost Ark where there's just crates and crates and crates?

I wonder if you could order the Ark of the Covenant on Amazon.

Don't open it up though.

No one's ever thought to say.

Let's see what you're facing tonight.

Speaking of indie films Gillian.

Anyway let's hear this theme song for love.

Five, six, seven, eight.

Wait a minute.

We did it to her.

You know what I really like about the Indiana Jones characters?

What's up?

He has a really great arc.

What?

Girl up.

All we need to grow up.

What about that Noah film?

Remember the...

Uh...

What do you know about it?

I don't remember it.

We said the guy from Gladiator.

Yeah, Gladiator.

Well Russell Crowe is in it but I thought it should have been Russell Two Crowe.

Yeah.

I mean Two by Two they came onto that arc.

They were really messed up by just bringing a crow on there.

What if he had a crow on his shoulder the entire day?

It's like it's two.

It's two of us.

It counts.

Hold on.

It counts saying this to the camera the entire time.

It counts everyone.

But the idea is that Russell Crowe would have sex with the crow.

No he's not having sex with it.

Well that's why there were two of everything.

Well sure.

So they could repopulate it.

But not just because God was some sort of OCD weirdo.

That's the last scene of the...

I didn't want to spoil but that's the last scene where he's like alright buddy it's time.

This is an impression of Russell Crowe.

It counts.

Seriously it counts.

Hey what are you doing here?

Oh dear.

Noah.

Yes God.

Oh he had a famous that's right.

Dr. Cosby had a famous routine.

What's a cubit?

Where he talks to Noah.

Oh really?

Yes.

That's a problem even if they could have a baby it would be sterile.

Oh like a mule.

Like a mule.

Why?

Because if it's not if you're not of the same species it becomes sterile.

Yeah a mule can't have another mule with another mule.

Isn't that a shame?

Wait so...

A human hit a crow having sex wouldn't produce a crows man.

Wait a minute.

Could a...

A crow man.

A new viable...

Could he...

What are you him?

I have sex with a dog and create a dog human but as long as it's just sterile it's happened.

No that could happen.

Wolf.

Oh that would never happen Wolf.

My mom wasn't human and my dad certainly wasn't a dog wolf.

Did you say your mother wasn't human?

Wasn't human.

Was human.

I don't know about that.

That's a weird thing that you've said.

I'm sorry you're on the record.

Since you started talking about this Wolf.

Alright get to it.

I'm gonna say it's a six, seven, eight.

I think it's that account destroying me.

How slow do you want to do it?

You want to be a little slower?

I'll already want to swing a little more.

I'll take care of it.

Follow me for the cheers.

Will you please?

You say up but I say down.

I say smile and you say frown.

You're the opposite of me but I think we're in love.

Let's tell the TV show love the end.

Wow.

I think you got something there.

Number one.

Mmm.

Theme song, Alan Thix theme song for love.

So funny.

So funny and perfectly timely for when that episode came out.

That's right.

Don't you agree?

No longer timely.

Stop listening to it.

And us.

Oh I like that poem.

Turn off your podcast machine.

Four weddings and a funeral.

I just saw that.

Turn off your podcast machine.

No longer timely.

Well you know what it is time for.

It's time to hear a message from our sponsors.

We need to take a break.

When we come back we're going to crack the top ten.

That's exciting isn't it?

Yeah.

Wait you don't sound excited.

I don't know.

I guess I mean you didn't think you were going to live this long.

I never expected this to be here.

I thought it'd be rusty in power.

You thought you were going to die in between eleven?

Yeah I just assumed.

No.

I mean unless you do during the break.

This is exciting.

This is a cliffhanger.

Thank you.

I might die during the break.

This is a real cliffhanger.

Okay let's see when we come back if Paul F. Tompkins is alive and not resting in power.

I hope it's an ad for caskets.

Alright here we go.

We'll be right back with your top ten.

Alright welcome back.

Is Paul F. Tompkins still alive?

Let's find out now.

You know a lot.

He's back with us.

Do you long for the escape that death will bring?

Now I'm thinking that these are recorded and then when I am dead.

People are going to be bummed out.

Mightier this.

Instead of being happy.

Well that happens a lot with some of these.

We have good friends who have passed on and they get buh we occasionally talk about death.

But it's a part of life.

Here if I could bring a private thing into the public sphere.

We'll see.

I texted you recently because there was some dude, one of these white supremacists dudes on Twitter that said something to me and so.

To me?

He blinded me with white supremacy.

Supremacy.

He blinded me with white supremacy.

Time to bring it back Dolby.

So it'll show you, you know you click on someone who's a counter it'll show you who you might follow no one comment or whatever.

It said followed by Harris Whittles and I just screen captain said that to you.

I said in retrospect bad call Harris.

Yes.

Why was he following it?

That's so weird.

Who fucking knows?

Who knows?

All right we are back.

We're cracking the top 10.

This is exciting.

This is where the the countdown really heats up.

This is where the rubber meets the road.

Exactly.

Rubbing is racing and you are wearing a rubber right?

At all times.

Okay.

That was such a big joke in stand up in the in the 80s.

Like late 80s because it was the safe sex thing was is response to the age.

Sex is best when it's one on one.

Yeah, it's natural.

It's fun.

Best when it's one on one.

Yeah, at least I left a little bit as I got a condom in my glasses.

But so there was so much so everybody had condom jokes.

Everyone standing in front of a goddamn brick wall had hilarious jokes about condoms.

And I cannot tell you how many hacks I saw say I'm wearing one right now.

And it's like God loves every time.

Every time.

It's a weird time to wear one.

I get it.

I understand it.

I mean he's saying what he's saying is he's where he's just standing up.

They're doing his job.

He's wearing a condom.

Well, maybe you don't get it.

Plus flaccid penis.

Maybe you don't understand it.

The penis is hard.

I never made that connection.

Yeah.

So what the joke really is this guy is saying I actually have a hard erection right now.

The hard penis and I may comment at any moment.

At any moment.

At any moment you should be thankful I'm not doing it against my jeans.

Yeah, against against against my jeans.

My jeans.

A Bob zigger.

I'm coming against my jeans.

Oh, coming against my jeans.

We listen to a lot of Bob Seager on the road.

Yes.

Fucking great road music.

I got to say Bob Seager is greatest hits.

Great road music, great memories.

I will probably always think of the tour when I think of Bob Seager now.

And I pop it on every once in a while.

Lauren, I was surprised Lauren is good, I don't know, 10 years younger than us or something.

And she knew them all.

She's like 21 years old.

She's like Zoltard.

What?

She's like Ben Zoltard, machine.

Her favorite movie.

Yeah.

She loves the movie.

She loves big, really?

That's probably because she's like 13 years old.

She is 13 year old.

I feel weird about having sex with her.

Why do we all have sex together?

I'm weird toward that one.

It was strange.

Sure.

Hey, when in Rome.

But you know, I remember now when it started because people were chanting it from the crowd.

Really.

Sex with each other.

Yeah, I remember it was a disjointed chant.

So that's sex with each other.

Sex, lock her up, lock her up, build her up.

All right, let's get to cracking that old top 10.

Here we go.

We'll get to the tour and talk a little bit more about the tour in a minute.

But let's crack the top 10.

This is your episode 10.

Number 10.

And this is an episode it may surprise you to learn.

Call the same.

On May 23rd, and this is an episode called Time Bobby 4.

Now the title surprises me?

I don't know.

I don't know what surprises you about this.

You said it may, well you're the one that said I may be surprised.

I'm saying it's possible that something might surprise you.

Oh, that's so weird.

I'm not surprised.

Okay, great.

I know that this was the title of this.

I don't care if you are or you're not.

I'm just saying it might have been.

I care even less than you do.

So.

Time Bobby 4.

I can't believe that we did it again.

Can you believe we did?

But I have to say, I don't mean made the list.

We crazy.

I mean that we did another episode.

We crazy for this one.

But I thought the fourth one, one of the better ones that we've done.

Time Bobby, let me explain if you are, this is one of your first time listening to comedy bang bang.

Explain it to me like I'm five years old.

Okay, do you need some candy before I continue in order to focus?

I'm five.

I wouldn't mind some.

All right, here you are.

Thank you.

I'm glad you're doing business with you.

There is.

Wait, now you're just leaving because you got your candy.

It worked.

You get my priority star, candy, little else.

There is a person named Bobby Moynihan.

He's a current cast member on Saturday Night Live.

And he has always loved the show, has loved the podcast.

I think listen to it before he got on SNL.

Absolutely.

Super fan knows a lot of the references.

And he.

Those are deep cuts too.

He came on, I think a second episode or third episode he came on and said, hey, I want to play an orphan.

That was the only idea he had.

And he had the name Forval, which was one less than Fival.

And that was all he had.

And that's all we had.

And that became the classic episode time, Bobby.

One of the better episodes I think we've ever done of comedy bang bang.

And we love nothing more than to beat something into submission.

But I have to say, we've done time, Bobby, two, three, and four.

And each of them, very funny.

And each of them have made the list, the countdown list, every single time.

Now I have to say time, Bobby, four, a little low on the list.

Then the others were.

I think we were one for time, Bobby, one and one for time, Bobby, two.

I believe so.

Time, Bobby, three, not as much so.

The bloom has fallen off the rose.

Who knows?

But it is cracking the top 10.

And I remember when it came out thinking, wow, this one was probably better than three.

I really thought that four was really enjoyable.

It's hard for me because they all blur together.

Yeah.

And I can't remember specifically what was in this one.

This is one where we're going to hear it.

Forval believes he's done.

He believes he's done.

Yes, okay.

Yeah.

I thought this was a great new wrinkle to it.

Let's hear it.

This is your number 10.

Number 10.

Oh, gosh.

Four-ville sense tingling.

Four-ville.

Must be danger, well.

Yes, I'm afraid there is imminent danger.

No, I'm not worried about the danger, guys.

I'm here.

I'll say, have you seen the film, final destination?

I have.

You have.

Well, then this will be easy to understand.

You know how people died in that?

Yeah.

That's going to happen to you someday.

What's going to happen to everybody?

It's got to be...

Yes, it happens to some people sooner than others.

Sometimes in 3D.

Sure.

Yeah, what time I think it did happen to people.

Yeah, maybe the third time.

I feel like it's a lot of...

Probably.

That sounds about right.

Or the fifth, I'm not sure.

Probably around the third.

I feel like it's just a lot of tires flying through the air and killing people.

Yeah.

Lots of time.

I don't believe they went to a racetrack at one point.

Yeah.

I...

There's no way a knife didn't fly the screen at some point.

No way.

No, absolutely way.

Look.

Yeah, it's going to happen to all of us, but much like the teenagers in final destination.

I'm doing pretty good.

I've got superpowers now, and I've got a room and a home and a couple little jib-jabs going.

But, for a little, what everything's coming up for?

For a little, send me one of those jib-jabs.

But what if I were to tell you...

And any dub smashes that you do, I would like to...

Yes, please.

Or any boomerangs.

Yeah.

I don't want the boomerangs.

Okay, take him off the boomerangs.

He's gonna see a list.

Oh, it's a big...

A couple bit mojis, I'll throw you away.

I do like bit mojis.

Oh, they are the bomb.

I do.

But what if I were to tell you, Forval, that instead of a little tiny room, you could have a giant cloud playground.

Yes.

With streets paved with gold, and everyone you've ever loved would be there.

Really?

Yes.

Doesn't that sound wonderful?

Five-old.

Nine-ville, nine-ville, two-ville.

And anvil.

Everyone but Five-ville.

Yeah, Five-olds.

Sinko-vil.

My Spanish brother.

See?

Couture Seville.

Yeah.

They would all be there.

And whoopi-two.

If you like, well, I don't know about whoopi.

Soon, she'll be along directly.

It's just like those.

Sooner than you might think.

Yes.

Pets are a penny from under the door.

Yeah, the original ghost.

And the fellow who played the mean ghost in Ghost.

He'll be there.

And Patrick Swayze.

Patrick Swayze is there right now.

Wow.

Yeah.

What if I told you that that could be yours and might be yours very, very soon?

I will be yours.

Well, I would say that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard.

It sounds like the most beautiful place on Earth.

But I mean, not on Earth, but I have still, I have things to do down here.

I've just been blessed with these powers and I've just started to realize that life is worth living.

You're saying.

You're saying, well, what a wonderful realization you finally come to.

But are you saying you have unfinished business?

Yeah.

It complicates things.

Lidown for just a little bit.

It could serve this thing.

I need to solve the scotchic.

Yes.

I'll be right back.

Just gonna take a little nip-nip.

Sidebar with Lloyd.

Okay.

Lord.

Oh, Lloyd is right out of order.

Lloyd Andrew Lord.

Not at all.

Of all the things you could call me, don't call me Lord.

Christopher Lloyd.

Christopher Lloydmas.

What?

You don't know what I'm talking about.

Making less and less.

Well, look, what is going on here?

You think he has unfinished business?

What I'm afraid of is that if we don't make him right with this idea, that his demise is imminent, yes, he will have unfinished business and he will haunt us as a ghost.

Much like the dad who drank the acid on Christmas Eve.

Wait, is he a ghost?

I think he's a ghost.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Much like the Sunset Boulevard house?

Yes, the Sunset Boulevard house.

With William Holden?

Yes.

In the pool?

That house is halted by the entire cost of Sunset Boulevard.

What do you think?

William Holden, people always come up.

You know, would come up to him and say, hey, you William Holden, I need the pill.

I need the pill again.

Do I think they would always do that?

Yes, I need the pill.

Give me that pill.

Where do I think it ever happened?

Either.

God damn it.

Oh, God.

Yeah, take a pill.

Okay, I'm back.

Full strength.

You started to slip that for the full strength.

You started to say the stupid shit.

I'm back though.

I gave it the top of my game.

Thank you, heavens.

For little girls.

What do we need to do?

Do we need to get him right with us?

Yes, we need to get him to accept what is to happen.

Sure, the stages of grief.

Yes, yes, yes.

Do we need to go through the other ones?

Denial, et cetera?

Denial.

Hey, fuck you.

Anger.

Yeah.

I'm saying...

We're pilot-phrasing anger.

Yeah, yeah.

Hey, fuck you.

Yeah, well, I couldn't remember that term, anger.

Bargaining.

Yes.

Just to quick.

If you can't remember the term, you might need a pneumatic device that might help you remember.

Okay, very good.

Okay, so anger.

What is A?

Anger.

Okay.

What's the end?

Here's the thing.

Yeah, there's a whole range of manic device, a new manic device.

A new manic device.

A new manic device for this.

Don't raise the mailer, demon.

It's dab-da.

Dab-da.

When we...

Denial.

Anger.

Dab-daing.

Despair.

An acceptance.

Dab-da?

What about despair?

Yes.

Okay, denial.

Anger.

Bargaining.

Despair.

How can anyone remember dab-da?

You just said it.

Good work.

That reminds me of my good friend dab-da-col person.

Okay, I'm back.

Oh, hey.

Thank you.

For moving too soon.

Pills, effective.

Take that bill.

You say it's some stupid shit.

Take another pill.

I wonder if you're taking so many of those pills.

Give me a red.

Decreasing the effectiveness.

Give me a blue.

Where's Jessica Jones?

Um...

Beyond Limit, that's it.

Oh my gosh.

Um...

That's Jessica Jones.

Never mind.

What, uh, what is your unfinished business?

Excuse me.

Uh, just, you know, to break- Forval, shut up, one moment.

Oh, what the fuck did you just say to me?

That's from a- that's from a comic book.

Give me a red.

Give me a blue.

Which character is that?

Well, it's Nuke, but he- Yes, yes.

He then moved from the Daredevil universe into Jessica Jones television universe.

Yes, I see.

Wait, was he in the- the first season of the- Yes, sir.

Yes, that's right.

I forgot that fellow took the pills.

Yes, because when I think- You mean a red.

You mean blue.

I don't think of the Matrix fucking first.

No, no, no.

Exactly, that's the thing, but then the- No, don't get on my side.

You were just mean to me for a second.

Now I'm pissed.

Yeah, yeah, we're pissed at you.

Sculptry.

Yeah, we're- we're angry at you.

Sculptable?

Yeah, yeah, we're teaming up.

You told me to shut up, man.

This is a Marvel team of- Yes!

Hook smash!

Hook dub smash!

Let me- let me, uh, pause it this.

Avengers, let's ammo.

What if- Andrew Lloyd Webber didn't say a thing that made you mad.

Oh, what do the watcher?

Can you imagine- This is a parallel universe.

This is a parallel universe.

And he presents it to us right now.

Yes, forbidden to interfere, but he sees all.

So there would be no Hulk smash-mouth moments.

Yeah.

Yeah, under the wire, you got to know that.

Yeah, thank you.

I think some listeners were a little upset.

I didn't get it in earlier.

Ah, for a lot.

I- I do apologize.

I- I- I- yes.

It's okay.

Nothing but the highest esteem for you- Thank you.

And you don't even have to apologize.

I'm gonna pass that now, but it's all- Yes, you're gonna be passing a lot.

You're gonna be making me think that I have finally found my true calling, which is helping people instead of being a stabby little boat.

Yes.

Well, carry that kind of feeling into whatever happens next to you.

You know what I mean?

There's a little cult trick.

There's nothing for it.

We've got to tell him.

So he can accept it.

Yes.

Dub smash.

What is it again?

You did.

Dubbed up.

What's happened?

What's wrong?

The spider that bit you.

It's packed full of radiation.

Yes.

Oh no.

But it hasn't given you superlative powers.

No.

Hold on.

I'm just like, eh.

Do you see how you're about to vomit?

Yeah.

That's not a special sense warning you the danger is imminent.

So, the strange thing is I threw up four apples, but I'm only three apples out of it.

How did you fit that in?

Oh, congratulations.

That's why my belly was so distended.

Oh.

Well, I'm afraid I have to tell you, you're dying.

You're dying.

You're almost dead.

You're going to be dead.

I know.

With next 20, 25, 30 minutes.

Really?

Probably after plugs.

Oh no.

Yeah.

Do you think we are?

I think exactly.

Yes.

It's a certainty.

But for all this is natural death comes to all things.

Yes.

But I was doing so.

In a hundred years, none of us will be here.

Just think of it that way.

And we'll all be here.

Well, wealthy people will be.

But I just turned it around.

The singularity.

I better not tell you now.

You just turned your life around and what better time could there be?

Tell love and kind of home and started a real life.

But, but, but, but for all of us, what's wonderful is you did manage to do all these things before the end of your life, which is very, very soon.

Yes.

A lot of people don't get that chance.

A lot of people are just miserable assholes right up until the moment they die.

Yes.

You, Ebenezer Scrooge did.

The one as big as me.

Do I...

So I'm definitely gonna die?

Yes, I'm afraid so.

Is there anyone you want to call?

Ghostbusters.

There are only, that's the only possible answer to go.

What do you think about the reboot?

Even if I was dying.

I think it's gonna be great.

I just don't know about turning them into women.

Switch is strange.

Quest your dog.

I think it's because life is too short to be like that.

Literally.

I think if it's the Stay Puff Marshmallow Woman, maybe.

But they gotta do it across the board.

And then turn all the women from the first one into men.

So I think that the ghost that gives Dan Aykroy to Blowjob, that's gotta be a male ghost who gives Kate, you know, it goes down on her or something like that.

That those are my rules.

And certainly all of the extras should all be gender reversed as well.

Yes, exactly.

They should count the number of extras.

You know, Ron Jeremy was an extra in Ghostbusters.

What?

That's a real thing you could see him predominantly featured during the last scene.

Oh God, no, why we wasting time talking about that?

I have no doubt conserved your strength, dear forefather.

Is there anyone you want to call any family, any whoopee?

Do you want to call whoopee?

Is there anyone who should be here at this hour?

I don't know if I got anybody.

Oh dear.

I'm starting to feel so alone.

Oh dear.

Almost like Kevin in that movie.

You feel like I've been left here?

Yeah.

I feel like my next door neighbor is Mitch McAllister and he's screwed this whole thing up for everybody.

But he's really nice.

He didn't exist.

These movies wouldn't exist.

Oh no, no, no, no.

What do we do for a whole...

What do we do?

Can we make you comfortable at all?

So you're no longer denying that you're going to...

Okay.

Well, I mean, you guys seem so adamant about it.

He did deny it for a minute.

He said it did deny it for a minute.

But now he doesn't seem to be...

What's next in W?

Well, it's A.

What is it then?

Dab, dab, dab.

What's anger, anger, anger, and...

Christ sake.

I can't remember it.

Together.

No way this could be happening.

This mnemonic device is...

There's no way this could be happening.

No, you're just...

You're just...

You're angry.

No, no, you're denied.

I'm not going to die.

Okay.

You're going to stay alive.

It's a dub smash.

Oh my gosh.

It's a whole dub smash.

It's a mash-up dub smash.

A whole dub smash of denial and anger.

Oh my gosh.

What's after that dub, bib, bib, beauty?

What is it?

Why would it be beauty?

I don't know what this is.

Bitterness?

What is it?

What's the B?

Bargaining.

I don't feel so good.

All of a sudden...

Poor four-four-four-four-four-four.

Look, maybe if...

Maybe if you gave me some of your blood, I could stay alive.

Hey.

How do you want to get this blood?

There were transfusion in them swords.

I don't know that we have the type of swords.

Oh, yes.

Good catch.

I mean, I'm not a medical doctor, but I would take my knife, cut your throat, and then maybe drink that shit.

Oh, it's not really the way blood looks.

It doesn't have to be a throat.

It could be an arm or leg.

No, no, I don't think that's going to do the trick.

Plus, I don't think you can find a vein on me.

Look.

Look, I don't think it's going to happen.

I don't think it's going to happen.

What's next?

What is it?

Despair.

The saddest one.

I just had, because I just got a room and I just got all this nice stuff.

And you have a son on the way.

I have a son.

Although, that one moment for him.

I'm not sure about this son, but he thought he had superpowers.

Yeah, but it's just dying of reading.

At the same time, we've never gotten his age.

Do you have pubes?

Excuse me.

You heard me.

Rather a personal question towards the end, but please do answer it.

Yeah.

See, I think he's old enough to do that.

They're not on me.

Yeah.

I just carry him around in a bay.

I think he's seeing yours or someone else's.

Wait, is it Jay Davidson's?

It's Jay Davidson.

Oh, no.

From the crying game.

Oh, yeah.

I don't leave him in my bandal ear.

I'm wondering if his seed might find purchase.

Perhaps?

I don't know.

In hoopy gold bags, a battered wound.

I think anything's possible at this point, he might have a son.

Today has proven that scotch-riaking is...

Yes, I don't know.

I do.

I have little baby boys.

It's terrible.

Four and a half, though.

Oh, this is terrible.

That was a real stomach sound.

Well, these sorts of things happen at the end.

What's next in W?

It's Dabda, and it has been for the past 15 minutes.

What is it?

Eight.

Anger.

We've done that one.

Acceptance.

Forval, you're going to die.

I am.

You are.

Wow.

Okay, that was great.

He's all in.

With a ball.

Well done, you.

Wow.

Okay.

Fourville, yes.

I'm so sorry.

I take you right.

Yeah.

But fourville, may I say?

That's it for a little old fourville boy.

May I say that I'm so glad that we got to see you once more?

One last time.

You've turned your life around.

You've been such a friend to the show.

I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

Yeah.

I came here with the goodwill and kindness of a little orphan boy.

Yes.

And I killed everything and did a bunch of bad stuff, and you guys are so nice to accept me back.

Yeah.

What I thought was going to be a new chapter in my life turned out to be.

The end.

As Coco Marx would say.

Yeah.

Number 10.

That's right.

Dabda.

That's right.

Uh-huh.

Denial.

Anger.

Bargaining.

Despair.

Acceptance.

Have sex with each other.

Laughter.

All right.

Speaking of acceptance, we need to accept that we need to take a break.

All right.

What do you think about that?

I guess I have no choice.

We still have episode nine and eight coming up as well as the live episode number three and a little surprise at the end of the episode.

So stick around.

We are going to be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Mm.

Mm-hmm.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back here with Paul F. Tompkins, and we're deep in the top 10.

I mean, we're balls deep in the top 10 at this point.

We're so in there.

We're in the top 10's guts.

We're all up in them guts.

Oh, my God.

I mean, we heard number 10.

That means we're in top 10.

Hey, you know, balls deep is a gross phrase, right?

Yeah, sure.

It's not what you would call coothe.

Sure.

It's fun to say.

Up in them guts.

Yeah.

Even grosser.

Yeah.

Because you're acknowledging the scale.

You're kind of acknowledging the clinical nature of sex.

Of sex.

That it's like it's these body parts that are inserted and everything.

It's weird to think about, first of all, while you're doing it.

Yeah.

It's strange to think about that you're like in guts.

Yeah.

Like that people's stomach linings are just, you know, right next to your penis head.

Yeah.

So is that kind of what you were saying is that we were having sex so?

Your lower intestine is mere centimeters away from my shaft.

Yeah.

I'm, I'm, I'm, I might as well be.

I might as well be stabbing.

Yeah.

Stabbing you with my penis.

Yeah.

In your abdomen.

Yeah.

In your, like piercing your stomach line.

Yeah.

You may, you may as well, like if your belly button were a whole, I may as well just be having sex with your stomach acids, might as well be eating away at the head of my penis.

Right.

Yes.

That's exactly what one is saying.

I'm glad we took a little diversion into, into really breaking it down.

I appreciate that, Paul.

He's one to want to discuss those things in great detail.

Paul, if Tom can, you know me.

It's all I want to do is talk about sex.

You could barely say it.

I couldn't think of a thing.

I was like, super gross thing.

It was a super innocuous thing.

And instead you almost couldn't get the word sex out.

Sex.

All right.

Here we go.

Let's get into it.

This is your episode number nine.

Number nine.

What a weird rumor that Paul McCartney was dead and that no one was, and people believed it?

Yeah.

And they believed it because of a picture he took where he was out of sync with the other Beatles.

Yeah.

Like he, that, oh, I don't, I've never understood the logic of that.

They took that as evidence.

He's out of step with the other Beatles.

He's got all these things different than the other Beatles.

Oh, the license plate on the car and the picture was a clue and.

But, but here's what I don't understand.

He's off and if he were dead, he wouldn't have been able to take that picture.

I think they, I think they supposed right after the picture was taken.

He died because he was out of step with everyone.

And there were so many differences.

Yeah.

It does make it.

All of those things together.

All of those things made him have an algorithm.

It caused his death.

Yeah.

Well, we don't know.

We don't know the causes.

It's all we know is they covered it up when he actually remember, you know, when he turned 64, every headline was Paul is 64 or whatever.

Do you think when he actually passes away, rest in power, that the headlines are Paul is dead?

1000% they are.

They will be.

Yeah, for sure.

And we hope it doesn't happen.

I mean, 2016 was bad enough.

We certainly hope that 2017 means does not mean that we lose a Beetle because we, we've already lost one.

John Lennon's still around.

Now, as fans of the show now, that's right.

Now when Paul McCartney turned 64, did he fulfill all of the things that were in the song?

Well, I don't know if the person he was singing to still needed him.

Well, that's true because it's a question.

Yeah.

It's all a question to the second person song.

Like are you going to still love me?

Will you still need me?

Will you still feed me?

Feed me.

Yeah.

You'll be older too.

We'll have three, we'll have grandchildren and their names will be Vera, Chuck and Dave.

Really?

Yeah.

Very specific.

Did that come to pass?

I don't know.

Yeah, that's true.

I think he's got grandchildren.

Does he have grandchildren?

He does have a daughter.

She's like, you know, she's old enough.

You know, oh my gosh.

She hasn't been Zoltar.

If you know what I mean.

Why do I?

I feel like I.

There's this new dynamic where I start us on it.

Right.

And then when you continue it, then I get grossed out.

Yeah, I know.

But what's weird is you don't like to start on it.

I know.

Usually I'm going to start on it.

This is what you've done to me.

I'm sorry.

You've coming down to my level.

Technicality, no down below.

Oh, remember.

By the way, shirts in the store available for preorder.

Technicality, no down below for shirts.

That's true.

All the new shirts in the store.

Also a Hey Nong Man ain't nothing to fuck with.

So and speaking of Hey Nong Man ain't nothing to fuck with.

Let's get to our number nine episode.

This is from, guess what?

We heard February 15th earlier, which was one week after February 8th, which was the previous episode.

This is February 18th.

This is episode 402.

This is the following week.

Yeah, we've know just the following Thursday.

The following Thursday.

And 400, 401 and 402 on the countdown.

All in a row.

This is an episode called solo bolo trolo.

Now the solo bolos, if you're listening for the first time, the Ben Schwartz, who we talked about on our last episode with Horatio Sands, he was on an episode with me.

He was on an episode.

Normally, if you're listening to comedy bang bang, the format is thus I'll have a person, a comedian or an actor on is themselves for a good 20, 25, 30 minutes.

And then we'll take a break and then a comedian will come on and be a character.

Now weirdo.

Oh weirdo.

Now we were having such a good time with Ben, Ben and I riffing that he said we should do a whole episode just of this, just of the riffing together because he was tired of taking the break and having someone come in and having to talk and then.

So he said, let's do an episode just of this.

Now we did one called the solo bolo.

People loved it.

We did another one called the solo bolo do slow.

People love that.

That was on the countdown of last year.

This is the solo bolo trolo.

We've also done the solo bolo.

What trolo we'll see if that ends up on the countdown hint.

It does not.

And but we will still see.

We will still see.

Yes.

People liked the trolo weirdly.

This is now people.

I think I think the quatrolo was maybe better that had the birth of the phrase, hey, young man ain't nothing to fuck with as said by Lin-Manuel Miranda, writer of Hamilton.

There is our sound effects record going on.

And people like that episode a lot, but I think something about the name the trolo.

They voted for that instead of the quatrolo.

Maybe we split the vote.

Who knows.

Oh, maybe if we had only done one this year, it would have been higher on the countdown.

Greedy.

But we got greedy.

We did a quatrolo.

So anyway, it's a thing that calls out to be an annual event.

Not not a biannual event.

Are we saying that right?

But this is the one that made the countdown.

This is the solo bolo trolo.

This is what happens on these is Ben and I.

We get together, we riff a lot and we sing a lot.

Kind of like what you're hearing with Paula Dye here doing.

So I think more singing happens.

More singing happens.

We haven't sung a lot on this one yet.

We have not.

I wonder if we'll sing at all.

I wonder if we will.

And we will.

So we are going to hear a chunk from the solo bolo trolo.

This is we have done something on each one called the Olympic song challenge where one of us starts off singing a song and then the other one has to jump in with a new song that sort of the previous song reminds them of or has something to do with and we keep it going as long as we can.

They've turned into some wonderful, wonderful musical medleys over the years and this one is no exception.

This is the Olympic song challenge from your episode nine.

Number nine.

All right, we've done this in the last solo bolo dose low and now it's going to be done in all of them.

What was it called?

I'll tell you what it's called.

The elegant Mr. S. It was called the chosen looking the Olympic.

No, it was called the solo bolo Olympic song challenge, the solo bolo Olympic song challenge.

Solo bolo Olympic song challenge.

And here's what it is.

Benny and I challenge each other.

We have to sing songs that exist.

They're not the made up bullshit that we've been doing this entire time.

These are songs that actually exist from films, musicals, anything.

I mean, they're even just music.

There are a lot of songs.

One of us starts off with a song and then the other person has to blend into a song that sort of reminds you of that song.

It's an improv thing that you it's a free of what it's called.

Things called something.

It's called the solo bolo Olympic song challenge.

Sorry, right.

I brought it here.

No, I'm changing name.

Correct.

All right.

So you brought it here.

I started this bit.

You motherfucker.

Why do you not want to take responsibility for this?

I guarantee you.

Someone look this up.

I guarantee you.

And in the comment section, hashtag star.

You are 100% wrong.

No, I probably explained this.

No, I brought it up to you and you said, who I like this.

Let's do it.

I love how old it's wrong.

I just listened to it.

Why?

I mean, come on.

Take responsibility at some point.

All right.

So.

And this is especially for that guy who said Scott and Ben please stop singing.

This goes out to you.

This goes out to that gentleman wherever he is.

Hopefully he's in a ditch somewhere.

Pass the way.

Oh, I bet he's listening to this.

He's a fan.

Not a bit.

I guess not.

No.

All right.

So we're going to do one of us starts with a song, then we blend into another song that the other person we go back and forth, back and forth and we try to kind of end it in a spectacular fashion.

Yes.

And one song has to inspire the other one.

It can't just be a random song.

It's got to like something lyrically or musically or something like that.

Something's got to get us into this.

All right.

I started last time I went.

You just start this time.

Just any song off the dome off the top of your head.

Can I go Hamilton?

Can we go Hamilton off the bat?

We could if you want.

Sure.

Yeah.

Maybe you just want to get into a montage of it.

I could feel you on your mind.

I don't know what ever you want to do.

Whatever you want to do.

Anything you want to do.

No, let's start without that.

And we'll see if we get there somewhere else.

All right.

Here we go.

Okay.

Give me a second.

Okay.

It can't be happy birthday.

That's my one rule.

Okay.

I got it.

Ready?

All right.

Here we go.

What are you going to say?

Happy birthday to you.

See, that's exactly the song I did.

You start often.

All right.

Here we go.

Anything that was that bad?

It was okay.

Here we go.

Ready?

Take me home tonight.

I don't want to let your granddad say that I lied.

Here we go now.

Take me home tonight.

I don't want to be your baby.

Be my little baby.

Great.

Be my baby.

Oh.

Don't let your fool.

Don't see.

That was wrong.

Oh.

Yeah.

And I just can't live with the band.

Yeah. How we feel about blind people in the piano. Okay.

Are you blind? Am I the piano? All right.

Let's take a break when we come back. We are going to hear your oh our live episode will be right after the break. We're going to crack the top three right after this. We will be right back with more comedy bang Bang Bang after this. Comedy bang bang we are back and it is time, Paul, for to crack into our live countdown or mini countdown within the countdown. It is time for to crack into it. Yes. You try talking as much as I'm talking. By the way, how much what do you think the ratio is? You act like I don't know what this is.

Like I've never done the same.

You try talking for five minutes. But now that I'm on a new topic. Oh, you're talking.

What do you think the ratio is of talking on these best ups?

You to me.

64. 60 40 or is it is it a true 50 50? I think it's probably 55 45. 55 45?

Okay. What about 51 50? Oh, shit. I can't drive 55. Oh, you want to?

All right. Let us get into our mini countdown our live. We're counting down the the top four episodes of the out of the 39 live ones we did this year. This is your episode three.

All right. This was August 28th, August 28th, the end of Augie doggy certainly.

Oh, we're definitely in the throws of Augie doggy at this point. So wait. Okay. End of August.

Was this San Diego? No, sir. San Diego Comic Con. End of August. End of August. We were in Australia. That's right. We were in Australia. This is the episode from Sydney, Australia.

So this made the best of well, we didn't vote on them when we did the howl wrap up.

Yeah. For the weird. This wasn't a countdown. We just decided what the best was. This wasn't a countdown. Don't call it a countdown. We just decided what we thought the best of was. We just went through the episodes. We didn't really call the best of though. It was a best of but we it was like we may have cut out some. I don't know, Paul. We're in the middle of this best. Can we just focus on this one fair enough, bro. This is you Paul of Tomkins, Lauren Lapkis went on this leg of the tour and also my canford. Yeah, man. Was here with us and we were joined by a very special guest, Claudio Adoriy. That's correct. You heard her earlier in the countdown with Weird Al and Jessica McKenna. She is from Australia and I just reached out to her and said, you know what, I wonder if she'll be in Australia. I don't know how often she goes to Australia. It turns out she only goes twice a year for one week at a time. So I had a one in 26 chance and she happened to be in Sydney on the day we were playing Sydney. She had just gotten back. She had just gotten back that day. She had just flown in, I believe that morning and she decided to appear on the show and was a great addition and gave the people in Sydney a thrill.

She was treated like a rockstar there.

Yes, she was and deservedly so.

Deservedly so. Now this is we'll hear a little bit from Claudia. I don't know who you're playing.

Who are you playing in this? I don't have it in this.

That's right, Andrew Lloyd Webber and I can't remember who Lauren is.

Oh, who Lauren was maybe Todd? Maybe Todd, maybe I can't remember but I do know that my canford is going to be Calvin Redding. That's right. One of the most exasperating characters.

By the way, when you hear this, it's about 1,100 people in the crowd. We arrived at the venue to find that unlike what is required by the contract, there were no seats in the venue.

Yes, stand in your room.

It was a standing venue like a rock club. Yes.

An 1,100 seats at theatre. Everyone was standing and we had two openers. We had my canford is the normal opener and then we also had another opener who did like 15 minutes.

Local stand up.

In retrospect, we probably didn't have to send Mike out there.

Probably not. We could have just come out.

That one guy who was like a part of the deal that we had no control over.

Right. It was perfectly fine.

It was perfectly fine.

So just and then we did a two hour show, I believe, of the partnership.

With an intermission, too.

Was it with an intermission?

We had to have an intermission.

Right. So this was so long and this is at the...

We'll first hear from Claudia, but when you listen to Mike at the end, just put yourself in the mind of you're a standing audience member who's been there for three and a half hours. Yeah.

All right. This is your number three.

I don't know if you know this about me, but I'm a Greyhound breeder.

Okay. I'm not sure how I would know that about you.

Well, I think my friends, I mean...

Friends would tell a friend something like, I'm a Greyhound breeder.

Friends would ask friends if you were a Greyhound breeder.

So you ask every single person you meet when you're deciding if they're going to be your friend or not, if they're a Greyhound breeder? Yeah.

Okay. It never came up to me.

No, we did talk about it.

We did? Yeah. We did talk about it.

What did we say? Remind me of the conversation.

You were sick that day. You were like, I've got a favor, anything I say today, I may not remember.

And I was like, okay, Scott, I'll get you a glass of water, but first, are you a Greyhound breeder?

And you're like, I'm not. And then you didn't ask me, but I was like, I should tell you.

I thought it's kind of rude that you weren't asking me.

Sure. And I was like, I should tell you, I am a fine Greyhound breeder.

What was my reaction, if you recall, was I was just happy to get the water?

Fainted. Fainted. You were so sick. You were so sick.

And surprised. Was it sick mixed with surprise?

Yeah, I think so. Because you love dogs.

I do. I'm a big canine lover. How many Greyhounds do you have?

I have three Greyhounds.

That's not, I mean, that's not a lot for a breeder.

They are such good Greyhounds.

Are they all male? Are they all female?

Two female and one male.

Well, that's lucky for him.

No, but they're siblings.

Because they're not breeding to, they're the babies.

They're the babies. They're like pups.

Oh, so, oh, okay. So how are you a breeder if you only have puppies?

I bought some Greyhounds from a shop.

And I went to the municipal competition.

I won the competition with the best Greyhounds.

But I, you know, it's the beginning of the Greyhound breeding business.

I see. So you start with siblings.

And hopefully by the 10th generation, all of that is kind of out of it.

The dogs, you know, they don't really, they don't really mind.

They don't. They don't mind.

Yeah, they don't mind.

What is consent to a dog?

Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

So what I'm not getting is you want a competition to come back to...

Well, that was just the craziest coincidence is that the prize was a flight back to Sydney.

And I'm feeling really jazzed about that because I want to see my mom, who, you know, she's my mom. I love my mom.

I keep winning competitions as she sets up.

And so I don't get to see much of her.

So I'm like, great. I'm going to see my mom.

I send her a text. I'm like, great news.

I'm coming back.

I get back to Gleeb where my mom lives.

Whoo!

I can't... Yes.

Gleeb?

That's the place here?

Yeah.

Have I not sung you my song about Gleeb?

Oh, you have a song about Gleeb?

Please step right up and...

Well, it's kind of about my life in Gleeb.

It goes like it's called Claudia of Gleeb.

Do you want to hear it now?

Yes.

Okay, it goes like this.

I walk through Gleeb with a pie in my hands.

I have a lot to give.

I walk through Gleeb with my heart on my sleeve.

I have a lot of life to live because I'm Claudia.

Claudia.

Claudia of Gleeb.

Eeee.

All right, let's break that down.

You have a pie in your hand.

Yeah. Well, when I wrote the song, I had a pie in my hands.

How are you writing the song then?

Well, it's just coming to me.

I'm walking through Gleeb.

Sure.

It's a beautiful spring day.

I have a pie in my hands.

Sure. What kind of pie are we talking?

Meat pie.

I see, which is a popular delicacy here.

A normal pie.

That's a...

The main pie is meat pie.

Right.

Are there not fruit pies here or...

We have them, but they have no cultural significance.

Just meat pies.

Got it.

So you were planning on eating this pie or you were going to deliver this pie?

My lunch.

So I didn't want to eat it on the street.

Eat it on the street.

I wanted to get it.

No, I didn't want to eat it on the street.

So I just kept walking.

I don't want to make a mess around on the street.

Sure. You don't want crumbles to fall.

Crumb, gravy.

The accoutrement of a pie.

Yeah.

Mince, minced meat.

That's it though.

Those are the three things.

There's nothing else.

Crumbs, gravy, minced meat.

Anything else is in a pie?

Name something else is in a pie.

Sure. If something else comes in there, you're in trouble.

Right.

Yeah, but you don't want anything else.

You don't want it.

Finger nails or...

No.

Yuck.

What about potatoes?

Is it a zirri?

No.

It's not a shepherd's pie.

It's a meat pie.

I beg your pardon.

So when you order a turkey sandwich, do you expect just turkey or...

No, that's like an American thing as well to be like, okay, because like what's chicken salad, Scott?

I didn't expect this question.

I would have studied.

I think it's chicken in mayonnaise perhaps.

That's so weird.

What's that?

That's crazy.

Does in Australia do you list every ingredient in everything that you sell?

Pretty cool.

On the menu, it has like the least of all the stuff in it.

And you're like, oh great.

BLT, bacon lettuce tomato.

BLT, black bacon lettuce avocado tomato.

You're saying popular sandwiches in the US as well.

We have these.

Well, what else goes on a turkey sandwich in America?

Tomato, mustard, sprouts.

Always those things?

No, it depends on the...

Look, I don't want to litigate turkey sandwiches with you.

That's not why you're here.

Why are we fighting?

We're such good friends.

Why are we fighting?

We're such good friends, but you never remember anything about me.

We talk all the time.

And then you never remember anything I tell you.

I'm always sick.

I'm always fainting.

Yeah.

But thank you for the glasses of water.

You're welcome.

I want to keep you hydrated.

Thank you.

That's the number one thing people forget.

And that's where the brain stops working.

It goes hydration, then 9-11.

Exactly.

And then it's the...

Your pin.

Your pin is?

My...

I'm not gonna say...

Oh, I never mind.

This is a really good who's on first routine here.

We're very good at comedy.

Yeah.

May I touch your pin is?

I'm not going to say.

You sell hay.

That's right.

I'm trying to break this down.

You sell hay.

I sell hay.

You're allergic to it, it takes.

Right.

I carry two suitcases with me all the time.

That doesn't seem like enough hay to sell.

Like if people wanted some hay?

Yeah.

Although at the same time, he's never sold any, so it's almost more than he can sell.

I never sold any down here in Australia.

I do okay.

Remember, I do okay in the US.

So you sell just enough hay to get by?

To get by.

I have a question for this haymonger.

Yeah.

In your, in your suit in case, is it, is it merely the hay samples or is this the finished product?

No, I've got folders with schematics and pie charts of where the hay is coming from.

How we're getting it to you?

How much is it going to cost you?

That's a big question.

A lot of people have what I'm talking about.

So I go, hey, what's this going to cost me?

They always say, so, well, all right.

Well, we find it here in the folder.

I have numbers for you to look at.

How much hay do you need?

Then that's my question.

They come back to me with a specific about a, a number of bales.

Usually in the hundreds that I look at, it's a graph sort of thing.

I'll find that number.

Hundred, you know, 300.

Found it.

Then I'm, then I'm going right on the schematic to find the price.

Soon after I find it, I deliver that news vocally to the person.

So, I'm going to find the price.

And in this country, I'm hearing a lot of, I actually don't need any.

Thanks for wasting my time in your own, idiot.

So did you go out today and try to sell hay?

Yeah, here was my whole thing.

I, I was, I came down here and I said, all right, this is a country.

I made that distinction by vibe.

And I said, all right, I'm going to sell these people, you know, hay for Halloween for hay rides.

This I'm going to make a fortune here.

No, no, no, no, we don't.

Yeah, they don't have Halloween here.

It's what I find out every single place I go.

What's a hay ride?

It hurts, you know, it doesn't, not hurt what people ask me that.

It's your livelihood.

This is one.

People don't know what hay rides are.

It's by livelihood, but it's not what I care about most, but it is by livelihood.

What do you care about most?

Well, I do like the Harry Potter movies.

I almost feel like we should talk about them.

But, who's your favorite character?

Sorry.

No, I'm just, there's nothing in your life.

You care about more.

Than the Harry Potter films.

That was just one other list.

Oh, I do make your part.

I'm sorry.

If the story- If you said so immediately I thought this is the most important thing.

It's the highest other list, but it's not the only thing I'm a list.

So it is the thing you care about the most.

I guess what you put it like that.

Do you have a family?

I do.

I have a brother-in-law.

So do you have a sibling who's married to him?

Well, not to bring the room down, but I used to.

I said not to bring the room down.

Well, that's unfortunate.

Yeah, she, well, my sister, she got- Let's just say- What?

I'm not going to say buy what, but she got run over.

I feel like if you were to say what she got run over by- Then these people, we don't want to hear that.

You said the worst part.

I don't think you need to conceal the idea.

No, because these people might drive cars and they might say, well, I don't want to be the person that run over someone.

It was a car, you know, and she got really run over.

She was- We were at an ass car event.

Whoa, really a fast car.

No, it would not.

Was this a race car that drove over her?

It was an ass car event at the local ball.

They were, you know, Tom Petty was there to do autographs.

Tom Petty?

Sorry, Richard Petty.

Was Tom Petty there though?

He was there and lied too behind me.

Was that exciting?

What?

Was that an exciting feeling?

Not for me.

If it was for my sister, she loves him.

Loved, I should say loved.

She- I got to get used to that.

It wasn't- It wasn't who recently?

Huh?

Did she pass recently?

It was, when was this?

This was right before I left for this trip.

I said, can we just please do the funeral?

Like, today I'm leaving.

Very sued.

That's so insensitive.

I know, but we did it.

We did it. We got it done.

It was the fastest funeral you've ever seen.

It was quick, really.

Huh?

How fast was it?

That felt like some sort of setup.

Did you say a secret word?

How fast was it?

Uh, lightning does that strike twice.

Oh well.

Hey, manga. May I ask you, um, all the flights- Are you saying, Hey-nong-mung-guh?

What?

Hey-nong-mung-guh.

I'm saying Hey-mung-guh.

Oh, my mistake.

Just strange thing.

On the flight, uh, to this country, presumably from America.

Yeah, Illinois.

What did you watch on the plane?

I was trying to watch the old ab fab episodes.

It was from 2006, this one was from- I thought I'd give it a shot.

I turned it on and there's a laugh track on it that I didn't appreciate.

So- I turned to the person X to be and said, Is that- can I borrow your headphones just for one second?

Because they were watching the same thing.

But they were watching it, you know, about 15 seconds ahead of me.

So I'd see kind of what's happening and I did not appreciate that.

I borrowed the person X to be, uh, who I later learned his name was Reba.

Was wearing- Corner like shorts on a plane, which I've never seen before.

I said for such a long flight, maybe you get cold.

And she said, you know, I tend to run hot.

And I said, okay, we explained to the sweater.

She's wearing an Eddie Bauer sweater.

And she said, my legs run hot.

I can't explain it.

My husband, you know, thinks it's the funniest thing in the world.

We stayed on the plane?

Reba was- he was not on the plane.

Why not?

I don't know.

I don't really know though.

So I borrowed her headphones.

And- Where do you think he was?

Well, I have a suspicion that he may have had his own business trip that he had to go on.

Because she said something effective.

Oh, he's meeting with clients.

You know, he couldn't make it.

He didn't know where he was.

No, because she didn't say he- he flew somewhere.

He's meeting with clients that I'm thinking at home.

Who?

What does he do?

I didn't know what else.

Have you ever had a business meeting at your home?

Right now I'm staying at an Airbnb.

Oh, here in Australia.

No, just overall in your whole life.

Have you ever had a business meeting at your home?

No, I usually do it either at my office.

Or someone else's home.

Or far.

I did one at a restaurant.

I went to- I don't know if this reference is going to connect with anyone here.

Applebee?

No.

Applebee?

Applebee's.

Okay.

Yeah.

I had a client who I was supposed to beat out in- they were a- done.

Roll route 34.

This won't connect with anyone here.

I said fine.

I can't make it out that this early.

This late the day.

So is there any restaurant near you that we could beat?

They said Applebee's.

I said actually I haven't eaten did yet.

We met there.

I had a- It was a salmon.

It was like a glazed salmon type thing.

I don't know if any of this is going to translate to you people.

It's sort of like a- I want to say a maple glazed salmon?

Crusted?

I don't know.

The french fries were great and I forget exactly what he had.

If you were in Illinois would this really connect with people?

You know I don't know if they'd find the story interesting but they know the route I was talking about.

And they might have an interesting story that they tell me about it.

Oh yeah.

But how has it you've been out here 10 minutes?

And you and I still haven't gotten to- Haven't said a single interesting thing.

That seems impossible as a human being.

I don't know if that's true.

Number three.

Oh, exasperating.

Is it not?

That character.

The hay salesman.

Who debuted on the- In Chicago.

In Chicago.

It's a unique gift that Mike has that he's able to be so calmly boring and then come up with the most inane details.

Yeah.

It's really, I mean it's an amazing thing.

It is.

It's kind of like the game that Harris played the first time he did Carl's Jr.

Where he said I want to come in and do an anti-character who never says anything interesting.

Yeah.

And he couldn't help himself and he said he just kept thinking of jokes and made that character really funny.

Yeah.

But the challenge at first was to be very boring and mundane.

Yeah.

But Mike is doing sort of that and not having an interesting story that progresses, but doing it in a slightly different way.

Yeah.

It's very interesting.

And it's because it's like Mike has this ability to make it seem like the guy thinks this stuff is interesting.

Right.

And then it's all these details are very important.

It's very important to him.

Yeah.

And yet he, the performer knows that none of them are interesting.

Yeah.

It's a very interesting balance.

Yeah.

All right.

Let's take a break.

When we come back, we are going to hear the number eight and we're going to have a little surprise for you for this holiday season.

For me?

Well, no, you know what it is actually.

Oh, fuck.

But for everyone listening, sorry.

Shit.

Sorry.

All right.

Let's take a break.

We'll be right back with comedy bang bang.

Sorry.

Comedy bang bang.

Back here with Paul F.

Tonkin.

I'm back here with Scott Ockerman.

What a coincidence.

Wow.

It really is.

And boy, we are, I mean, I hate to say it again, but we are balls.

Deep in this top 10.

We are actually our penises being dissolved by stomach climbing.

Actually, let's not say we're balls deep in it because now that I think about it, balls balls deep would be number one.

Like think of, I guess so think of the listeners as a 10 inch penis.

Sure.

And I do.

We are three inches deep.

I'm imagining a 10 inch penis with headphones on.

Is that weird?

I like it though.

I bet you do.

Is that a sure?

Freaky.

Yeah.

We're three inches deep.

Trying to get balls deep.

Seven inches to go.

So let us get to it.

This is your episode eight.

Number eight.

All right.

This is from June to June two.

Second of June.

2016.

You're nowhere around the studio at this point.

That's right.

Where am I?

I don't know.

Where are you in on June two?

Do you have a calendar where you could look it up?

I do.

Look it up, Paulie.

Oh, this is what it feels like.

Look, Paulie.

Look at this.

This is exciting.

Look it up, Paulie.

Look it up.

Look it up, Paulie.

Look it up.

Is it the wrong month?

Look it up, Paulie.

Look it up.

Look it up, Paulie.

Where were you?

I was at the dentist in the morning.

Ooh, ouchie.

Oof.

Yep.

That was it?

That was it.

And then you took the day off.

Yeah, took the rest of the damn day off.

You're one of those guys.

Hey, I got a dentist appointment.

Clear my schedule.

That's right.

Just in case.

That's right.

Just in case you're not going to be able to talk.

Well, just in case you take my tonsils out and then I have to watch soap operas and eat ice cream.

Do you think that every time you go into the dentist's office, you're going to regrow your tonsils and you're going to need to take them out?

I saw all my tonsils.

You do, really?

Yes, I do.

I believe I still have one or two of them.

So am I...

They took some out, but then they left some out.

I think you only have two tonsils.

Okay.

So that's why I said I would be about one or two of them.

Hell that I say that though.

I don't know.

I think you have four, don't you?

Oh my God.

Oh no.

Now you better...

Look it up, Scotty.

Look it up.

Look it up, Scotty.

Look it up.

Look it up, Scotty.

Look it up.

We're already being told by...

Five.

Yep.

Five.

Most people have five tonsils.

These include...

Ew!

These include what?

The first one.

The second one.

Single pharyngeal tonsil, often referred to as the...

The ton.

...allocated in the posterior wall of the upper part of the throat.

Gross.

A pair of palatine tonsils is found at the back of the mouth.

A pair of lingual tonsils is located at the base of the ton.

Like Emperor Palatine?

Yes.

Move from Star Wars.

My dad's moved.

Yeah.

I saw my tonsils.

I still have my appendix.

So do I.

So my wisdom teeth.

And your virginity.

Your v-card.

I know.

I'll never surrender it.

Thank you.

Except in heaven.

Wait, you're gonna...

I'm waiting until I go to heaven, after this.

Who are you gonna fucking heaven?

Anybody.

God?

Oh, figures crossed.

Do you think that God, if when you get up to heaven, God would let you fuck him.

He was like the ultimate.

Here's the thing.

And I'm not trying to sound full on myself.

Sure.

God is, you know, an asexual omnipotent being.

Sure.

And presumably when we get up to heaven, we will no longer have gender identities.

Right.

But I think he'd be, I think he'd want to have sex with us.

I think that he would be into it.

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

I mean look.

Look, look, we'll see what happens.

It's heaven, so great things are up there.

What's greater than fucking God?

Yes.

At last.

I got to fuck God.

All right, let's get to it.

This is from June 2.

This is an episode called Sunday afternoon taped.

Now, this is a bunch of people.

This is Andy Samberg.

Sure.

From Saturday Night Live in Brooklyn, 9.9.

This is Claudio Doherty.

We've been hearing a lot from her.

COD.

And this is Nick Kroll.

And this was an episode.

I can only usually, I can really only get Andy about once a year.

He's very busy.

He's one of the hardest working guys in the world.

Produces Brooklyn 9.9 as well.

Has to be there all the time.

He also so sneakers.

He's so sneakers, yes, in China.

And he's constantly flying back and forth.

And those are two more than full-time jobs.

Yes.

Those are...

He made my iPad.

He did.

He's got tiny fingers.

That's the thing.

Watch Brooklyn 9.9 and take a look at his hands and his fingers.

Tiny tiny fingers.

But they taper down perfectly.

Exactly.

It's like, they almost, it almost looks like they can have a sharp point.

It's like Lady Death Strike or something.

Yeah, you know.

So, can only get him once a year.

We got him and when you do get him, it's at weird times.

When you do get him, it's great.

Yeah, when you get him, it's weird times.

No, it's usually weird times.

And the other interesting part about his appearances, he sets them at a time and then normally, we'll call you an hour before and go, hey, I just got off.

Can we do it now?

And then, which forcing me to wrangle all of the other participants to say, can you come earlier?

So, I believe this was one of those times.

Why can't you wait the hour?

I don't know.

What?

Because it's like, I just got off Brooklyn 9.9.

If I just go home, I'm going to fall asleep or die.

Let's see if I go home, I'll die.

That's a good horror movie.

If I go home, I'll die.

This is very easy not to do.

So, this is happened probably five times, where I've called the other person.

Sometimes it's Adam Palley ago.

Adam, how soon can you get here?

It definitely happened with this time.

Can you get back into characters, bro?

It happened this, bro came back this year, by the way.

We'll see if that ends up on the countdown.

It happened this time, where I believe it was eight o'clock, as when we scheduled it.

And then it was like, hey, it's seven.

Can we all meet, got everyone around?

He had just gotten off work.

Most of us had just gotten off work.

We usually don't do the late night ones.

And then we found out that ear wolf had a keg tapped.

Where, Angie or Cody Cody, what do you call it?

It's a, what is it?

Keg stand.

It's a keg stand.

And what kind of beer is in there?

Yellow.

I can't recall.

It's some kind of beer.

We found that out that night, and we said, oh, well, it's night.

Why don't we have a drink?

And Angie had given up gluten, and it was the first time he'd had a beer in like a year or something like that.

We all immediately got buzzed that quick from one beer.

And a very loopy energy, and it kind of took over the episode.

Angie's himself, Claudia's herself or her character of herself.

I myself and then Nick Kroll comes in as R-Shrift, his Australian character.

Very ballsy to do an Australian character in front of Claudia.

Absolutely.

In front of an actual Australian.

Absolutely.

But she enjoys it.

So hey, who are we to judge?

All right, so let's hear it.

This is R-Shrift.

This is your episode eight.

Number eight.

Did you leave something in the studio?

Why have you come back?

I left my hat in here.

Oh, let's get a look at this hat.

It's Cleveland Indians.

That's my team.

Whoa.

Yeah.

She's always roots for them.

It starts a little boy growing up in Cleveland.

Did Phil Negro just capture your imagination?

Every day.

Yeah, I loved him.

And of course, who could forget the Cleveland Kevin Layers?

Who could?

Yeah, well, people that don't think people that are forgetful.

Yeah, Alzheimer's patients.

Yeah.

People who don't care about sports.

People who check out on sports teams names, yeah.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

I mean, if you were, Andy, if you had to name 30 professional basketball teams, could you?

I don't know that there are that many.

There's got to be 30.

If there's 36 NFL teams or so.

All right, let me try.

Here we go.

Professional basketball teams.

And try to go as quickly as possible.

Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers, Utah Jazz, Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, LA Clippers, LA Lakers.

Did I say Sacramento Kings already?

Nope.

Uh, Philadelphia 76ers, Miami Heat, Milwaukee Bucks, Eugene Flemflams, Memphis Grizzlies, Toronto Raptors.

You're at 15.

You're halfway there.

I love this.

Fuck.

Yeah, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, Austin Gibles.

Keep going.

Tennessee, Tennessee Titties.

Tennessee Titties.

I'm sorry, I have a new model.

Yeah, I know what you mean.

Yeah, I know what you're going through here.

Thanks.

Tennessee Titties, you're at 19.

Tennessee Titties, New Jersey Nets.

Sorry, Brooklyn Nets.

They moved.

You're at 20.

10 more.

Minnesota Timberwolves.

Yes.

Charlotte Hornets.

Yes.

Are they in Charlotte anymore?

They've got to move.

Yep.

Nope.

Who cares?

Okay, who cares?

You did it.

Ha, Ha, Denver Nuggets.

Yes.

Bozeman Titties.

Yep.

So, here's a note with some of the names on it.

Thank you.

Atlanta Hawks, Atlanta Hawks.

Where am I at?

Time.

You're at 26.

26.

26 and I need 30?

You need 30.

Four more.

Holy corollary, just the Arizona.

What about Arizona?

Is there one?

I don't know.

Yes, it's right here.

I've written on this paper.

Oh, Phoenix Titties.

27.

Portland Trailblazers.

Yes.

Seattle.

No, they're not anymore.

They moved.

Super Sonic's moved?

They moved.

It's not there anymore.

So many.

Oklahoma City Thunder.

How many?

You're 29.

One more.

Yeah.

Ah.

Washington DC.

Titties.

Time.

Titties.

You're not in time.

You have 29.5.

You said Washington DC.

Titties.

Oh, nice.

Oh, wait.

That one was wrong.

It's the Washington Wizards.

Oh, that's right.

Spiem, nice.

Here's another memory test for you.

What if we played the Hollywood Facts theme song?

I will definitely nail it first track.

All right.

Here we go.

Ready.

This is the Hollywood Facts theme song.

Let's see if everybody's singing along.

Nice.

Well, let's Hollywood Facts.

There we go.

We're downtown.

Going to Eaglewood now.

Everybody's doing it.

We're not doing it.

Know your stars.

There's Clitz and Glamour.

And lots of bars.

Get a drink.

At a club.

Then go down.

From to the Chinese theater.

Hollywood Facts.

Take out your dicks.

OK, let's try it.

The Facts theme song is the Hollywood Facts, bro.

Here we go.

Let's try it again.

Here we go.

And nice.

Well, it's Hollywood Facts.

And we're going downtown.

Going to Eaglewood now.

Everybody's doing it.

The Facts theme song.

Know your stars.

There's Clitz and Glamour.

And lots of bars.

Get a drink.

At a club.

Then go down.

In front of the Chinese theater.

Hollywood Facts.

Take out your dicks.

Take out the Facts.

The Hollywood Facts.

One more time for Takeout Your Dicks.

Here we go.

DICK.

Are you guys not singing?

Yeah, why aren't you guys singing?

Here we go.

And.

Maelin Demon.

Nice.

Well, it's Hollywood Facts.

And we're going downtown.

Going to Eaglewood now.

Everybody's doing it.

The Facts theme song is the Clitz and Glamour.

And lots of bars.

Get a drink.

At a club.

Then go walk in front of the Chinese theater.

Hollywood Facts.

Take out your dicks.

Check out the Facts.

It's the Hollywood Facts.

Bro, bro.

Yes.

Not bad.

Remember how many times we had to do it last time?

A lot.

Yeah, that was good.

All right.

Would you say we nailed it?

I think we nailed it.

Yeah, definitely.

Yeah.

Maelin Demon.

I loved it.

I loved every moment of it.

Well, it resides upon the internet.

So of course you would love it.

I listened to it on the daily.

Oh, on the daily.

Yes.

Really.

What about our shift?

Do you like it?

I loved it.

What did you love about it?

I loved the rhythm.

I loved the lyric, Kelly.

I loved every single moment of everything.

I loved it.

Wait a minute.

What's this rubber here?

What is this?

Wait a minute.

I'm so weak.

Wait.

Maelin Demon.

What?

Are you pretending to be Arshrift?

Please.

Please, just let me have this one moment.

So is Arshrift real?

What did you invent Arshrift?

Arshrift is real.

Oh my God.

As real as I am.

Wait a minute.

Are you real?

Oh, let me get.

Let me.

This is, this seems like rubber too.

Hold on.

Wait.

Oh my God.

Fabrice Fabrice.

Uh-oh.

What's up?

You cunt-ass cunt.

What are you doing?

Impersonating the Maeler-Daming impersonating.

I fucked all y'all fucking bitches.

Y'all fall off of some digital nazas, some Australian nightmare.

I should have known.

Y'all motherfuckers got pranked hard.

I should have known because like the rules with Maeler-Demon were soooo- Soooo-soggy.

Yeah.

That's right.

Like my dick, which is a soggy croissant.

God.

Well now I understand why all the jokes were so dirty.

Yeah.

I guess like they all came from one kind of mine.

Right.

That no matter what it sounds like at his core, it's the one in a resting idea.

Right.

Wow.

Hey Fabrice.

What's, what's been going on?

What's cracking with you?

I don't know.

We're just, you know, I don't know.

There's not a lot of craft service around here.

Maybe you're not a soggy.

I did craft services one.

Popster.

Did you un-popster really?

Yeah.

I thought it was funny to do all pop-tores.

Yeah.

It was very, very uh- I would imagine day two, or even half of day one that gets old.

The cast and crew were malnourished pretty badly.

Yeah.

It was like, you know how, you know how like pirates would go and get scurvy?

I don't know what your- Oh pirates.

Pirates.

You know how pirates would get scurvy?

They didn't have an old vitamin C.

Yeah, they needed an orange one.

What happened to most of the cast and crew on pop?

They got scurvy.

Yeah, because I was only feeding them kind of like, you know, meat-based pop-tores.

And Claudia, Claudia of Torvity, is that who you really are?

Yeah.

You are a- You are at Claudia of Torvity.

Yeah, that's who I am.

Mm-hmm.

Just one thing.

Wait a minute, you have something sticking out out of your shirt.

No, don't look at that.

What is this?

Wait a minute, you're just yourself underneath her?

I know, I just, it's easy than doing makeup.

I wear a rubber mask.

You wear a rubber mask.

It was good to send you real masks.

Thank you.

Yeah.

I spent a lot of money.

It was $26,000.

Wow.

That's amazing.

You think that's a lot of money?

Wow.

But in Australia, that's $26,000.

Exactly.

Glad you're still talking about Australia.

Yeah, wait a minute.

What's going on?

That's where Claudia made a mask.

Wait, what's going on with the rubber?

The breeze for breeze.

What is this rubber?

Cree?

Oh, it's our treasure again.

I knew it.

Is this the last one though, right?

I don't know.

Is it?

No, yeah.

Uh oh.

Forlana's mask.

All right, here we go.

Hey guys.

Wait, who's this?

Nick Kroll?

It's Nick Kroll.

Hey man.

Hey Nick.

Hey guys.

Wow.

What are you doing here?

I'm exhausted.

Yeah.

You do a lot of characters.

It's so impressive.

Oh, I didn't, were there characters?

I was, I've been hiding inside of this nest, though.

Right.

Yeah, a lot of characters on the exterior.

Hey Scott, Claudia.

Can I have a word real quick?

Yeah.

Nick, do you mind not listening to this?

Sure.

Yeah.

No, I'll take your headphones off.

Thank you.

Hey, Andy.

Hey, you guys.

This is fucked up.

This is so fucked up.

I know for a fact that Nick Kroll has something else he's doing right now.

There's no way this is.

This can't be Nick Kroll.

No, because I heard that he was going to be jacking off in the bathroom at Chick-fil-A right now.

He told me.

Wait, at Chick-fil-A's policies.

So this isn't me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's not me.

So look, we have two choices.

We can either try and pull off the mask and see who it is, or we can just fucking shoot him in the face.

I don't know.

I brought only five guns.

I only have 17.

I don't know what to do.

I think we should shoot him.

I think we should fucking shoot him in the face.

I'm gonna lose myself.

Because who knows who could be under there?

Who could be harsh rift?

Could be mailer demon or worse?

Oh, he's taking over another mob.

Wait a minute.

Oh no, not so best you're alone.

Hey, this kid makes great pictures.

Yeah.

This pop star I saw in a car.

I saw a car that was great.

Thanks.

That's a great picture.

Happy?

Andy, can I talk to you for a second?

Yeah, slide, excuse me once again.

All right, no problem.

I saw a little bit of plastic sticking up.

Underneath.

Slide, sure.

Get your collar.

You think that's not the real slide?

I don't think that's the real slide.

Why do you end on this?

I think I am in on this, but I'm scared to find out what underneath.

Why do you need your shoes?

What's gonna be under there?

Okay.

We're gonna need you to pull on it.

Okay.

Excuse me, Mr. Stallone?

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Just promise me, Claudia, if you pull the mask off and it's not actually a slosish slone and you think there's a chance there's another mask, you'll keep pulling the masks off super fast until there are no more masks.

You've got it, Andy.

I make this promise to you.

Okay.

Okay, here we go.

Here we go.

Yeah.

Excuse me, Mr. Stallone.

That's beautiful.

Oh, thanks.

Do you mind if I feel the collar?

Emilia was zig-na.

Wow, I love that.

Can I feel the collar?

Yeah, it's pure silk.

100%.

I'm...

Claudia, you're a real...

Now!

Boom!

The goal!

Claudia, now!

Oh!

Hello!

It's Mrs. Stallone.

Please, Claudia, please now, please.

Please, you have to.

New rules.

Let's build more.

Claudia, now!

Definitely leave it here.

Yeah, leave it here.

This is the real person.

Yeah.

No way, it's not.

This is who we were waiting for.

Is it a creaky gate?

It's a creaky gate.

I love this one.

So, wait, hold on, let me get this straight.

A creaky gate?

Or...

Like, approximately 35 masks?

Uh-huh.

Yeah.

And was doing characters?

This is standard.

This is shocking.

I don't want to speak out of term, but I think this is the part where you ask me personal questions when we get serious.

Oh, yeah.

Do you believe in God?

I'm not sure.

Crikey gate?

Don't you dare stop.

Don't you...

All right, fucking stop.

I'm answering serious questions.

Yeah.

You know what?

We...

I barely have any time left to ask you any serious questions.

But just...

I'm so sorry.

Because I feel like it would really sound nice right now.

Yeah.

I don't know.

Look.

God, this is the creaky skate I've ever heard.

It's so creaky.

It's just swinging open.

You have any gate grease on you?

Of course I do.

Oh, will you put it on?

Yeah, here we go, ready?

So now it's just a nice gate.

It's just a nice creakless gate.

Or is it?

Claudia, now!

It was the mailer demon.

The whole time.

Wow.

I guess you can see that coming quite a way off.

I could.

I can see the future.

Oh, what's going to happen?

Popstar is going to make 100 million dollars.

It's opening night.

Is that good?

Opening night!

Yes.

Claudia.

Uh-huh.

Season 14 of love will be...

It's finest.

Oh, well, I look forward to that.

What about me?

Scott.

Comedy Bang Bang will be the longest running podcast in earwolf history.

And now I know you're lying.

Claudia, now!

Hey, guys.

Nick, you're back.

Sort of...

Sort of.

I'm sort of back.

What does that mean?

What?

Oh, I don't even know.

Jesus.

Oh, wow.

Well, I was going to say this is a tour de force, but more like a force majeure.

That's fair.

Yeah.

More like a tour de France.

Yeah.

My Lance Armstrong.

Long and painful.

We found out he's been doping me.

It's crashes throughout.

It's like one net.

Doesn't deserve any of his success.

Fucking nutless wonder.

Number eight!

All right.

Sunday afternoon taped.

Just crazy.

Craziness.

Just people having a good time.

Not one of the most polished episodes of all time, but it's just funny people getting together and enjoying.

Compared to what?

What are the polished episodes?

Maybe this one.

Oh, good point!

Speaking of polish, I gotta...

We gotta talk about...

Let's...

It's polished time.

Stop!

Polish time.

Please polish.

Don't hurt him.

We...

I don't know what the segue could possibly be when, I say speaking of polish, but I was going to say, let's polish off something that we talked about last year.

Absolutely.

Now, last year...

At this time.

At this time, we were recording the best ofs.

And I don't recall how we got into it, but do you recall because you've listened to it?

I've listened to it.

I just listened to it yesterday.

Right.

And I still, I cannot tell you how...

Why we were talking about it.

Yes.

Okay, good.

We...

In the best ofs last year, go ahead, listen to it.

We'll wait.

We...

Decided.

We hit upon something called...

Please.

Well, it started as a plea.

Okay.

This Christmas...

Don't joke about iRobot.

I don't remember why.

The movie I wrote about...

2004 adaptation of Isaac Asimov's story, starring Will Smith.

It was a moderate success, I guess.

It was not like a huge bomb.

But not beloved.

No, it was not really talked about.

Strangely enough, I believe I auditioned to be the robot in that.

The titular robot?

Yes, the titular robot.

The one who goes, I...

Robot?

And you, man.

I auditioned to be the robot in that.

And the whole time I was thinking, they're just going to cast some big actor as this, which they ended up doing, I believe, right?

Is there...

I...

I would assume there's more than one robot in the film.

Yeah, there's a million robots, but there's like the main robot.

The iRobot.

Let me look up who the iRobot.

Look at him.

I think it was Alan Tudic.

Oh, sure.

He's good.

Yeah, he's great.

Yeah, he's terrific.

Yeah, been on Bang Bang.

But he wasn't famous at the time.

I don't know why I thought about it.

Oh, fuck no.

You could have...

I mean...

I could have gotten it.

Anybody could have gotten it, but you, I guess.

I guess I didn't.

Wait, I didn't get it, right?

You didn't get it.

I'm not that robot.

Did you hear that you were still in the mix?

I'm still...

Last I heard.

I'm still in the mix for Men in Black 2.

Never heard otherwise.

What about that 21 jumpsuit crossover with Men in Black?

Isn't that the weirdest subject you've ever heard of?

Yes, folks.

Don't do that, but...

Because they're both owned by Sony, they're going to do a crossover.

Hollywood.

It's very strange.

Don't do that.

Hollywood, don't do that.

All right, so we were talking about iRobot.

We said, please don't make fun of iRobot this Christmas.

By the way, we were barely talking about iRobot.

We mentioned the title.

We weren't talking about the movie.

Look, we just had to look up who was another person in it.

Yeah, I don't know why we got on this, but we start saying, please don't joke about iRobot this Christmas.

And then we said that would make a good song.

Yeah.

And then we said, hey, everyone, remind us.

Yep.

Next year that we want to actually record this song.

Yeah.

We stipulated that it would be a country song.

Yep.

Country and Western.

With a spoken word interlude.

Sure.

We, I believe we said it was going to be like a we are the world kind of situation where we got a bunch of people to sing on it.

That did not happen.

That spoiler alert did not happen.

But we are going to sing...

This is the debut.

This is the debut of our brand new single.

That's right.

This, this will be...

Look, cut this out, save it as an mp3, make this a staple of your Christmas listening from now on.

Christmas is right around the corner literally days away.

The goose is getting fat.

Please put a penny, one penny in the old man's half.

If you haven't got a penny, a hay penny will do.

Hey, you know what? If you haven't got a hay penny?

Fuck you!

Yeah, get the fuck out of here!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry for the radio.

Forget you!

We're going to do it.

We actually did it.

Paul, you wrote this song and Eben Schleider wrote the music and it has created a backing track for this.

We're actually going to do it.

We're going to do it.

So guys, being as we are just on the cusp of Christmas, a Christmas eve, if you will.

We're on a Christmas cusp.

Here's a special holiday classic for you and yo-asses.

This is Please Don't Joke About I Robot This Christmas.

Hit it!

♪ You don't have to wrap a gift for me.

And you don't have to put lights on a tree.

But I've got one request you must not dismiss.

Please don't joke about I robot this Christmas.

That's the cruelest thing that you could do.

Please don't joke about I robot this Christmas.

Because I robot would not joke about you.

You can sing a carol or in the snow.

♪ Gain a bunch of waiting left.

Ho, ho, ho.

♪ You can drink 10,000 mugs of Swiss miz.

Please don't joke about I robot this Christmas.

That's the cruelest thing that you could do.

Please don't joke about I robot this Christmas.

Because I robot would not joke about you.

I robot was released in 2004.

And as of this recording, has a 58% score on the rotten tomato's movie website.

That means half of audiences liked it just fine.

There were way worse movies released that year.

National treasure for instance.

Maybe make fun of that one instead.

How about the Boulder Express?

Pretty creepy.

M night Shyamalan's the village for crying out loud.

Hey, white chicks.

Come on.

White chicks is better than I robot.

Get out of town.

So this year, as you gather around the Christmas tree to open your presents, just this one time, don't joke about I robot.

Give a man of snow or carrot nose.

Squeeze the baby, Jesus' widdle toes.

But should you ignore my warning, you'd be remiss.

Please don't joke about I robot this Christmas.

That's the cruelest thing that you can do.

Please don't joke about I robot this Christmas.

Because I robot would not joke about you.

I robot would not joke about you.

Merry Christmas.

Oh, a yolotide classic.

Instant yolotide classic.

Oh, I have a tear in my eye.

I have a tear in my beer.

Because I'm thinking of you, dear.

I hope people take it to heart.

I think anyone who first of all, any monster who sits around the Christmas table and decides to joke about I robot.

Smoking about it.

Come on.

It's the Christmas holiday season.

Let's leave some of these movies alone.

When I first was writing the lyrics, I remember it as please don't make fun of I robot.

So this isn't even that.

Just joke about I robot.

Don't be like, hey, remember that time we went to see I robot and you're on?

Did something crazy?

Don't joke about I robot.

Please.

It's Christmas.

Well, guys, I hope you take that to heart and I hope you have a lovely Christmas.

But we're not done with our countdown.

We still have two episodes to go next week before in between Christmas and New Year's Eve.

So are you ready for those?

We're going to be going and doing number seven through number one.

I mean, I guess I'll have to be ready.

You're going to be ready because it's going to happen.

Yeah.

Paul, thanks for writing.

Yeah, just like death.

Thank you so much for writing that song.

I hope people enjoyed it.

Oh, and thank you to Evan Schleider.

Evan Schleider.

Turning that music around so fast.

In literally, I think, 12 hours did a full complete demo.

Absolutely.

Beautiful.

All right, we'll see you on Monday for the rest of the countdown.

Until then, have a wonderful Christmas.

Thanks, bye.
