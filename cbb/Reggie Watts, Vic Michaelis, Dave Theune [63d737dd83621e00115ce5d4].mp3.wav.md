I'm a garbage man, you're a garbage lady, let's smash our trash and make a dumpster baby welcome to comedy bang bang. Thank you to Mirkat 218 and thank you Reggie Watts for the wonderful singing the song and we'll see you next week. Actually, do you want to stick around today and talk on Mike or do you want to start plugging that stuff? But do you want me to stay?

Yeah, do you mind? I mean, our main guest didn't show up today.

Oh shit. Yeah. Do you want to stick around today? Yeah, I love my love hanging around.

Yeah, it would be great to have you. Yeah, I always try to get out of the way like quickly because like you got so much shit in here. No, you've done almost 800 episodes at this point and you've done the theme song to most of them and you always leave right after you're done. Yes, because I have to because there's too much stuff in here.

Yeah, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I have to trade out. I'm a hoarder.

Yeah. Yeah. I just cried myself. Anybody's impressed. I mean, I described myself as that you don't have to.

But yeah, it would be great to see. Yeah, stick around.

Okay. Great to have you. Yeah, yeah, I'll stick around. Yeah, I mean, I know we talk every you come early usually every week for about a half hour and we catch up. We do catch up. Do you want to do it on Mike today? Yeah, we can do it on Mike. Yeah, I mean, I screw it because like I was late today because of an injury. So.

Oh, okay. What did you enter or whom did you enter? I'm sorry. Were you injuring someone else?

No, it was like there was a there was a crow or I'm starting out a crow, a raven.

Nevermore. Yeah, it's just like constantly pecking at my back like I was having lunch with a friend.

And so I was a chair and there's a branch behind me, but it was like a super important meeting.

They couldn't see the crow because I was perfectly blocking it. Oh, okay. But it kept pecking, you know, at my shoulder. And so I had to just endure the pain because I gave this a really big lucrative potentially lucrative deal. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't want to disturb it. Well, you're great in meetings like that because you close in the room usually. And so it's. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's what committed I am. Yeah. So, so wow. So a crow the entire time, they couldn't see it because it wasn't shaped exactly like your head. No, I mean, it's just like the angle because of the shadows and stuff like that. He was sitting like slightly off access to me. So he was like slightly to my, you know, me facing him like if you were facing me. I think I sense the geography right now. Do you mind doing do you mind drawing a picture of it for me? Yeah, sure. Briefly. Yeah. Oh, that's the little beak.

Oh, okay. No, okay. I see that. Yeah. I think he was the opposite. Yeah, it's a top down view.

Oh, yes. I appreciate that. No worries. Well, I'm glad that you made it. Yeah, we didn't get a chance to catch up because of the crow today. So let's let's just catch up about what's going on.

Well, what have you been up to, buddy? Well, I mean, obviously every week we talk about how things are going on, you know, your other job, the the latest of shows. The latest of shows.

The latest show on television. The latest show. There's no show later. No, except for Night Gallery.

But at the end of your this, I've never seen a bit, isn't it true at the end of your show?

James Corden flips off the lights and says, okay, everyone go to bed because and then every network just like shuts down. Yeah, it's really beautiful.

Like, because you we used to do the sequence where you saw each like I was a camera feed for each studio and I was just like, you know, good night, baby. Good night, baby. Like the Waltz, man, exactly. Yeah. It's like, can I jump?

Boy, you know, we're that kind of, yeah. Good night prices, right? Good night prices, right?

Good night news. Good night, Bolden beautiful. And they really went good night because they're just they're not there anymore. They're just gone. That's a bold or beautiful anymore. No, neither of the bees are there. Yeah, but you know, but they obviously like they'd start doing that and then like commercials, they start getting more higher commercial densities. So they had to push that out. Right. Well, also, there's so many television shows. We're at Peak TV. I don't know if you've heard about this, but I've never heard of it. So many television shows, it took so long to say good night to them. But by the time it was done, it would be like, okay, good morning.

And then he would have to say good morning to all the shows.

Oh my God.

It just was it was like a it was like a second or third job for him. I guess first job is the show. Second job is movies like Cinderella. Yes. And then third job is saying good night and good morning to everyone. Yeah, that's correct. And come on, we can only have two jobs at a time.

Well, the other thing is to you had a third kid. Oh, that's what happened. Yeah. Okay. It's like, it was like, I can't do all of this anymore. And I have to actually spend some time with my family.

Right. Okay. That's good to know. Yeah, still not that much time with this family.

Okay. Good. Good. So you are on that show. It's it's on CBS.

Yep. And recently, much like the the power dynamic in the DC universe had irrevocably changed when Black Adam came.

Yes. So crazy. How insanely everything changed. Yeah, it was so strange. But the the the landscape of late night television is about to change because your show is going off the air.

No. Is this late night television in general or just the show? Just the show. Just the show.

Oh, okay. As also just kind of metaphor. Yeah. Oh, I understand that wasn't an actual type of like 44 more. Oh, okay. So 44 though. Interesting.

What does it actually go with here in May or April 28th? April 28th is the very last one. Yeah. What do you have planned?

I have you know what? Actually, I'm flying out to Salem really at night on a red eye to Boston, Boston that night to to attend Satan con. Which is a real thing. And it's a you decide to go to I get well, my friend, Alister, and I just for this last Halloween decided to go to Salem for the well, I guess what was this Halloween and we went with last Halloween.

I went to Halloween. God, what was the reason for Halloween thing? There was Deborah. Do they do it upright at Halloween? Do they do a big thing? It's kind of like a Mardi Gras of Halloween.

Does anyone do they dress like someone dresses as Deadpool and they're like, come on, man, that's not what we're doing. This is like witches and warlocks. Yeah. Yeah.

No, you don't get too much Deadpool action. Although, no, you don't know. I mean, it's mostly we went the weekend before because the actual weekend, I guess, is super hyper crazy.

But we had such a good time and we stopped off at the Satanic Church, which is now what you think it is. But it's just a cool organization of weirdos that are like trying to like, you know, be cool about who loves Satan and Satan. They love Satan.

But it's not as like, you know, hardcore as like other Satanic churches. Yeah, it's not like, I mean, the people who love Jesus, they really love Jesus. They're always like, you got to love Jesus and no one else. People love Satan. They're like, hey, you can like Satan. Yes. You can love Satan, whatever. But you can like other people too. There's a huge gradient and they're accepting of all Satanic, you know, dark thoughts. So you're going there. You took a look at that date for the last show and you were like, do I want to go to the rap party? Is the rap party over at James Gordon's parents' house or?

Yeah. No, I don't know. I don't know. Probably before, because you know, everyone's going to be like, all right, well, that was our show. Yeah. I'm not talking about it. You know, like, you know, you saw that and you were like, I don't want to be around for that. I want to go to Satan content.

Yeah, I want to go for Satan content. Well, because I don't know. It's like, I think it's kind of like a cool. It just had it lined up, you know, perfectly. And I was like, yeah, why not? Well, it's the perfect excuse. It is the perfect excuse. Because you can't miss Satan.

I got to go see Satan. Sorry, guys. Satan out. It is. It's a and it's important, you know, and James will understand. I mean, I think we're also, I think I think the party honestly is going to happen if they're smart, they're going to do it before.

Yeah, you got to do it before.

Because I think I think everyone's going to be an emotional wreck during the final show.

Are going to be wrecking it. Yeah, tears. Yeah. I have no doubts. I mean, my thing is like, because I get hyper emo, even though I'm like, I'm like cool up until the last minute and then I get really emo. And then when I get emo, I'm just like, I get the fuck out of here. So, so like, I'm the one I want to see that. No, what's not that I don't want to, I just don't want to, like, I've suffered from emotionally, and continents, you know, at times. And I don't want to, you know, have that loop and all like, it'll be take me days to get out of it. So, yeah, I got to get out.

No, it's true. I mean, the last episode of comedy bang bang, I think you took off in the middle of the second take. That's true. And you had to like, use CG or composite. Oh, yeah, you're CG'd for the last 10 episodes that you did. That's so insane.

Yeah. That damn it. Really bad.

See, too. Yeah. I'm surprised people bought it. Well, I mean, people will be anything with like, I mean, they'll buy anything as long as the writing is really excellent. Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, you, what's weird too, if you watch those final 10 episodes you did, you look like the, what is it, the T 1000 or the T? You're all metallic and shiny. Yeah. Well, yeah, because they couldn't get, I mean, the shininess. Yeah, it was just like basic CG plus you didn't have the money at the time. So just like, just grab the outfit, you know.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. We, I mean, we got the money later. Yeah, we were sort of like, do we go back and redo these like George Lucas with those Star Wars movies and make Reggie actually look like Reggie?

I mean, I guess you could do like, you know, comedy, bang, bang, remastered. Yes. You know, yeah, although we're not supposed to use the word master anymore. Oh, that's right. Reprine the masters of the universe. Yes, exactly.

Friends on that copyright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We can say Skeletor.

Of course.

We Skeletor. Yeah. You can be Skeletor. Yeah. We can remanded arms it. Well, that's an incredible achievement. You how many years on the show? If I'm guessing six really close, eight. Eight.

That was so close. That was really close. When you're talking about years, though, you got to be closer to two off. I guess. Well, you know, a lot of people are saying like 15.

So that's like two high schools. That is. Yeah, that is. It's like you were a freshman and a sophomore and then a junior than a senior. And then you're like, let's go back to freshmen.

Yeah. Yeah. Then I became then I was a kind of can't even think of his name, but it was like that.

John Cryer. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In hiding out. Yeah. Hiding. Hiding.

Hiding. Hiding out. I believe. It might have been hiding.

Are you going to miss it? I don't know. I don't think so. I think like, I think I will later, but there's going to have to be some time away from it where I'm like, oh, whoa. Whoa.

You know, like that muscle memory will be there. Yeah.

Definitely. I love everybody at the show is awesome. Like, like so cool. There's only so long you can listen to boring celebrities tell dumb stories, right? Do you have to listen to that? I sometimes don't.

I have I have taken naps before during those segments on the floor. The director loves it.

Do you have an earpiece in where they then say like, ready to get up? No, you know what? It's never it never has happened. I think I think they gave up at a certain point where they're just like, ah, it's fine. But, um, well, I mean, I will say that like on Letterman, who was the man on Letterman? He was a man.

He was a man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Letterman was a man as well.

Letterman was right there in his actual name. Okay. I was sort of a hint.

That's actually weirdly. I'd never even thought about the gender of David.

At what point, you know, because so there are so many names that are something man, something, you know, the fablements. Look at them. They're really.

Ockerman. At one point, do we start doing pronouns instead?

So like, Ocker him.

Oh, yeah. Ocker him. Ocker him. Ocker he.

I think that's that would be more inclusive.

Ocker is. I think Ocker is. Well, also we we change it. We change it from mailman to mail person.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Ocker person. And and garbage man to garbage people.

So he he person garbage. They them.

Garbage. They them. Garbage. They them.

Is this treacherous territory that we shouldn't be? Well, Jason. They them.

No, I mean, Jason. See, this is much better. That makes more sense.

And then we know what to how to describe him when he's shooting people in the head.

Exactly. It's like, well, they them and it's like, well, yeah, it's like sucks for them.

Right. Exactly. His victims. Yeah. Exactly. That could be his catchphrase too.

Yeah. Sucks for them. Yeah.

It's like, well, I mean, just Jason.

Save them actually killed people. He does. He does. Well, no, I mean, like, there's a couple and couple, but they deserve it, don't they? Most of them.

Yeah. Yeah. They'll like in the writing, they'll like, as they're in a Jason, save an action movie where he kills a bunch of people who deserve it because they're trying to kill him or they're there. Someone saw us.

And they just kills a random person just for fun. And everyone's like, whoa, dude.

Yeah. No. Well, first of all, there's only two. I mean, yes, you're a murderer. We saw you murdering all those other people, but that's like a bridge too far. That was just like a rando walking down the street. Well, it's like Berenstein, Berenstein, Berenstein, or whatever, like the Jason Mandela effect. Yeah. Like the, his, a lot of people think in the movies that he has killed a lot of people, but if you go back, he actually doesn't actually, he doesn't actually kill me. I rewatched the transporter the other day. And you're right about that because every single person he kills, you hear like a little person off screen going, I'm all right. Yeah.

Almost. Yeah. It's really like, if you do audio, like really intense audio masking, and you like the software or whatever, it really brings it out. That hurt, but I'm okay.

It's like, I'm just an actor. Yeah. You'll hear that sometimes. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. No, that is, that is the thing. Sometimes I'll watch a movie and I'll be like, Oh my God, this is so intense. And then I have to remind myself, Oh no, they're all actors.

And I wish they would just say that a lot. Like, I wish at the beginning of a movie, everyone is going to be in the movie would like come out on screen, look into the camera and go, okay, what you're about to see is going to be fucking crazy.

But we're all actors. Everything was cool. I know there are like car stunts that seem dangerous and people getting shot in the head, but everyone's okay. Yeah. And then they go away. And then at the end, they come back out to remind you of like, Hey, remember what we said at the beginning? Everyone's cool down. Yeah. Yeah.

I think that would be healthier for people because I'm sure some people are like, you know, mourning the loss of these characters. A lot of these characters don't even exist. They're just yeah, many characters and stories and stuff like that aren't even real people.

Yeah. Like I watched that avatar, the the water movie. Oh, a Vader.

A Vader. Yes. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, is that how you pronounce it? I had no idea. A Vader.

So I watched a Vader the other day. And so many of those those fish are dead.

And I was like, Oh my God, the world has fewer fish.

Yeah. Are those the the fictional fish? I think they're fictional though. Now that you mentioned it. Yeah. The fix fix fix fix fix. Yeah. I mean, even like people will mourn the loss of fictional fish too, because they don't know that those that there's not a world that's not this world that's somewhere out there. Like they believe that that they took cameras and went to that actual well, finding Nemo is the only movie that was actually shot in this universe. That's true. Right.

And so the so the the mom fish who dies at the beginning, that's one we should actually mourn and feel the loss of every other movies on a fictional universe where there are fictional cameras filming it. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Well, I mean, the cameras are fictional.

They're the real cameras. The real how do they transport them over to the really good cameras too.

Do you remember remote viewing? Yeah. Of course. Yeah. So it's a form of remote being so professional camera persons. They can take their cameras over to these other in the remote viewing situation. Yeah, they can project the cameras. I always wanted to do that. They're still using the camera. So they have like a regular camera with a green piece of green cardboard in front of it. And then they just like they project themselves there and the camera picks up what they're projecting. Have you ever done the remote view? You're a gear a guy that I would think would yeah would have tried that. Well, they used to call me Rimo Williams. Oh, okay. But I was just taking the T.E. off of it. Yeah, just because I'll remo you know, just because it makes it fit.

Remote viewing Williams was the original title of the movie.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was remote viewing Williams and he was good at it. He was great. I mean, they never show it in the film, but it's heavily implied that he does that. It's in the title. It's right there in the title.

Of course he does. Of course he does. Yeah. No, no, I'm pretty I'm decent at it. You know, like not on purpose by accident. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Okay. I'd love to do a session with you at some point. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. It'd be cool to like find ourselves into these other places and then see each other and be like, wait a minute. I'm sitting right next to you. Oh shit. That would be cool.

And now I'm here in this other place with you too. Why don't we just open our eyes and see each other in this place? Oh shit. That could work. That would be so.

That would be so. I mean, we could be doing it now, but we might be so good at it. That's true.

Yeah, that's true. We could be at the CIA headquarters just doing it right. You can only do it from a CIA like branch or. Yes. It's got to be it's got to be a franchise. It's branded. Yeah. It's like a.

It's like not in this location.

That's not official. Reggie, what are you going to do next?

Because I obviously you have Satan Khan coming up on April 28th. That's correct. But what is going on after that for Reggie Watts? What what what does the future have in store?

I know that we're we're not soothsayers. We're not fortune tellers. We have no idea what the future holds for any of us for certain. But I know that you must be making plans. What's going on with Reggie Watts after the show ends? Yeah, that's a that's fantastic. Yeah, I am. You know, I have I have a book coming out.

What is this book? Because I I've read every book that's come out. Yes. And you I have not read one by you. So I it's not out yet. It's not out. Okay. It's not out. I mean, every week on on the books come out on Tuesdays, I'm just I'm just overjoyed because I have all the new ones sent to me. Oh, that's so cool. And I read them all by the by by the next Tuesday. I'm like, see you next Tuesday to my person. Oh, I always looks to me like very weirdly. Wow, it's crazy. But shout out, you see me.

Yep. Yeah, I mean, yeah, and there's like what on average like what nine books a week that come out.

There's usually between eight and 10, eight and nine usually. Okay, so yeah, so nice, like roughly in the ballpark. Yeah. Yeah, this book comes out, I think in the spring, hopefully right after the when young men's flights of fancy turned to love and a more mhm, a more a a whole more a. Yeah, it's I don't know when it's good. It's going to come out in the spring. That's what they say.

You never know what these publishers. Well, at this point, you should have a release date. Okay, I think they usually work very far. I think it's soon. I mean, it's done. It's probably coming.

It's done. You just you just haven't been checking music.

Well, yeah, I got to just choose a couple like there's a couple tweaks, you know, like the graphics, the font for the cover, you know, there's like the words involved, the words inside the other shape of the words, the shape, the content of the words, the content of the words, like, you have to write it essentially, right? Yeah, I still have to write it. And it's like just an idea right now. But I think it's going to come out in spring, because I think that's enough time. And what what is this book called? It's called Great Falls, Montana. But isn't that where you're from? It was a coincidence. Oh, okay, good. Yeah, it's based on my life. But you know, from birth to relatively now, but it focuses most specifically on my high school years, because I do want to make a series based off of that. I see so instead of just making the series, you say, let's make a book so that we can say the book, the series is based on a book, and it sounds classy. It sounds cool. Yeah, that sounds awesome. The only reason it. Yeah, I just wanted to I just want to actually it's like, I do a lot of jokes and stuff like that. And this time I wanted to just actually do something. Yeah, what did you do? What happened in high school that was so interesting? Well, you know, Scott, you you won't know this because we're not the same age, but it was the 80s for me. Oh, yeah. It was 1986. I've just gone in high school. I've just seen the breakfast club, which really makes me feel like I was ready for, you know, high school, you know, when I got in there, I was like, Oh, my God, it's just like the John Hughes movies. This is in the same. What am I doing here? You know, and I was like, Oh, full of wonder and all that. So, but basically, yeah, that's that's the vibe. Like it's about the 80s being in Montana and being a weirdo and finding other weirdos and having a really fun time and adventures. This is cool.

Did you see Tegan and Sarah's show about high school? No, I didn't. It's on freebie, my good fellow.

Oh, for me. For me. I believe it's called high school.

Really? Yeah, that's awesome. All right.

I like I love those guys. Yeah, they're great. Check it out.

And you could just just honestly just steal it. Okay. Yeah, I'll just take the writing. You have to be a lesbian. A lesbian.

I would call it a lesbian. I was just I was I was you're pausing. I was just like, Oh, be in lesbian. Yeah, you've heard of Mr. Bean.

Well, this is a lesbian. Okay. I think okay, because sometimes there are people who describe themselves as labying, which is right, right? The being. But yeah, you'll just steal all their scripts. I will.

Yeah, it's it's it's the easiest way to make a show. Yeah, no, that's that's how I do most of my shows. Good. Yeah. Okay. Well, this great Falls, Montana is coming out sometime soon. Yep, sometime.

We also contributed to the comedy bang bang book, which was very nice of you to do. So, thank you very much. I'm excited for people to see what you did in it. My pleasure. It was fun. It was difficult, but yes, it was so difficult. It was it was like what 60% of the book?

I mean, it's a good 82. I think I actually counted the pages. God, I'm just like Porsche. I was undelivered under delivering on the performance, but then in actuality, it's much better. Do you mean the car or Dara? No, I'm talking about the Canadian show about high school. Oh, oh, okay.

Got it. Got it. Got it. Well, Reggie, it's it's great to have you. Can you stick around for we have some other guests? You remember how we would do this on the TV show? I do. Yes, I do.

There would be other guests. I I vajually remember. You vaginally remember? Yes.

We have coming up on the show, we have a superhero. That's really exciting. Superhero is a very hot right now. Just superhero or a superhero? A just one superhero. Okay, gotcha. Yeah, and for not every superhero is here. Okay. We also have a soft drink representative. So that's very exciting. Oh, I love those. You do. The representatives are the soft drinks.

I love soft drinks. Just soft to anything as far as I'm concerned. It's like put my head on and go sleep. God, I love it. Right.

Yeah, put your put a nice Coke. Yeah, use it as a pillow.

Yeah, just the softest because those new soft cans are so cool. So incredible. All right. Well, we're going to take a break.

Reggie Watts has decided to stick around. We are going to take that break and we'll be right back with more comedy bang, bang after this. Comedy bang, bang, bang, we're back. We have Reggie Watts of the latest of late shows here with us formerly of the comedy bang, bang television show. And of course, does the theme song and not only do you do just the comedy bang, bang theme song, but do you want to do the the that other song that you do for the show?

I need you to what's going on with you right now. You're behind you. Oh, okay. No, no, actually get in front of the mic. I know you want me to back you know, no, no, not physically. Yeah, get in front of the mic is actually where I'm just going to be coming a little bit. I don't want you like that. Raven. Okay, now I'm back.

Okay. All right. Here we go. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. What are the other powers of a man? Reggie, what are some powers of a man that you can do? Can you can you can you can you like get mad at like a mistake like like tripping on something?

I love doing that. It's my new favorite thing. Another thing I'm very good at ordering appetizers at Italian restaurants. Oh, yeah. Perfect amount to have enough for everyone and then leftovers for the next three days. That's it was it seemed like a flex when you're saying the perfect amount for everyone at the table. But then of course there's a leftovers for three days. That's could be adding about. I would argue that's the perfect amount. I think that is it is a perfect is one of the perfect amounts. Yeah. So what are some of your other powers? Are you able to look at women walking down the street and ask them to smile?

Oh, I do that all the time. And then my wife. Oh, you have a wife. You're married. I do. She turns to me and goes, were you just looking at her and I go, uh, you're crazy. So that's another thing that I can do. Okay. Gaslighting. Yeah.

I'm kind of a bad guy. Yeah. You're a bad boy. I'm a little bit of a bad boy. Those are man powers. So yeah, yeah. Yeah. You know, I got about 700 children and so congrats. Thank you so much.

What are their names? Okay. Well, no, that's fine. So starting off sort of alphabetically, we got Abby. Abby. Oh, okay. So not a hard work. No, not a hard work. She's at Brown right now.

Yeah, it's very exciting. She's sort of she's she's a brand, a close right now. It's a, you know, so learning to be poisonous. She in the dorms learning to be poisonous. Yeah. She's at the dorms.

Yeah. Thank you so much. So, you know, watch out for those slippers though, you know, people trying to swat at her. Scott, we don't joke about stuff like that. I'm not joking. I'm literally saying she's got to watch out for that. I've lost about 40 of my kids. As long as we can agree. I'm not joking. Sorry. Sorry. We can agree. You're not joking. We're okay. I'm honoring them.

I appreciate you saying that. It's been pretty tough. Um, us as a family. I'm so, so sorry. How many children have you lost out of the 700? About 690. Give or take. No, really.

And what's tough about that is because if I spend too much time with them, I will eat them. So, that's also been sort of, you know, I am, I got the mind of a man, but I haven't lost all the spiders. What I'll say. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have the life expectancy of a man as well? I do, which has been really tough. Yeah. Because it's sort of like I watch everybody that I love and know. Well, your wife is going to be married to a human woman. Oh, that's a, you know, Tara Reed.

Yeah. From the big old Balski. Just in the pussycats. Yeah.

And Charonado or Chardonnado, as I thought it was pronounced. Charonado. Charonado. Charonado.

Yeah. My wife met her a couple of times. So that's pretty exciting. Oh, that's pretty cool. Wow. So where did you, where did you meet your wife? Hinge. Hinge. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. Scrolling the app. So, I was talking to a couple of different people. It's, are you able with your little ways to scroll apps? Well, I got a couple of different likes. I got a glove that you put on and it's sort of, oh, right. If you press it hard enough, you got to press really hard to get exhausted. But you have the powers of a man. So you. So I've the fortitude to continue to persevere. So can you, you can technically, like you could do multiple screens, right? Because of the, you've got more than three legs, right? You would think it's like an octopus, but with arms. Well, if Apple would answer my messages to make phones small enough for me, that would be a thing. But the phones are still phone size. So emails you're sending are probably too small for them to read.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's, it's pretty tough. That has been tricky. So I end up using a human size phone. My phone calls, I can play apps. I'm not very good at Candy Crush, because it takes me a very long time to go from each to sort of to scroll.

When you say you're not good, like, what's your high score? I'm on level seven. I mean, that's pretty good. Better than I'm.

It's way better. I'm at zero. I'm at zero at this point.

Yeah. I haven't even turned it on.

Okay. So this is the kind of kindness and connection I'm looking for that you just don't get in the spider community, but the human community won't accept me. How do you do it a little bit?

Is your wife into spiders? She married me for my mind. Oh, that's nice.

Right. Where's I located, by the way? My mind. Yeah. Sort of in my stomach.

Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Go real man style. Yeah. Yeah. Got feelings. Go for the gut.

Yeah. So what are you? Are you a, I introduce you as a superhero. Are you a superhero?

Are you out there fighting crime? I'm trying, Scott.

Actually, part of the reason why I was coming on here, I was hoping you kind of like stuff, right?

So I wouldn't go that far.

Can you get me a, can you give me a intro to the, the Avengers? Maybe Jess is like, something like that. The Reggie, just as a week. I just wonder who you know.

You mean like a, you mean like a theme song? Just that league. Oh, just that league.

Yeah. Do you mean a theme song? Because Reggie does great theme songs.

I mean, I think it's on corner again. Oh, as much as I love that, maybe I'll pause on that for a second.

Well, you see here. Just again.

Ham is this phone corner. Yeah. Come on. Ham is this phone corner. What?

Yo, come on. Ham is this phone on the phone. Give the phone.

It's a phone corner.

Thanks, Reggie. That was great. Yeah. That was beautiful.

Yeah. Right. My year too.

That was fantastic. Yeah. So again, that would be wonderful if maybe you think that what do you have? I mean, here's the, what do you got? Oh, you mean like, oh, it's like, oh, yeah, like, I hear the ovens of the world. Okay. That was beautiful.

That seems more like a theme song for the Avengers. I was hoping for something for me. Oh, I guess you guys have an intro to the Avengers.

Oh, I understand. Oh, I understand.

Oh, I understand. It sounds a little like, like, uh, something like when I was a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big.

Oh, yeah. I think it's a little bit of a bad thing. It's a little bit of a bad thing.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think it's a little bit of a bad thing. I think it's a little bit of a bad thing.

Yeah. I think it's a little bit of a bad thing. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. I think it's a little bit of a bad thing.

Yeah. Yeah. And then people sort of tell me what they've been doing. Yeah. I like the talk shows.

I don't really know that. Huh. It's kind of a superhero, right? Yeah. It's kind of, I mean, do you think they're the people we most admire? You're right. They are the people we most admire.

No, I couldn't do that. Who would want to hear a spider interview? I think it would be interesting.

I mean, as long as you don't talk too much about spider things, you know, because people find spiders to be kind of gross. To be honest, with my left hand, I've grabbed my slipper and I'm like kind of wrestling with whether I should smash you in the head right now. So Scott, don't do that. I've killed a few of our guests over the years. So I think, well, the potato died definitely while she was here. And but I can't remember if I had a hand in that or not. But yeah, I've killed a few of our guests. Oh, there's a there's that fairy that that came when the busiest man in the world was here. Oh, I see. But, but yeah. So I mean, just don't talk about spider stuff too much. Talk about talk about human interest.

Yeah, I could try that. Listen, if you want to practice on Reggie, like Reggie's going to be promoting his book. Yeah, yeah, I can.

Reggie, hello, my name is Spider-Man. Oopsie. Hi, by the way, everyone knows, everyone knows your name because it's in like the theme song of the show.

Okay, but you asked me to do it. This is what I would do if I was a theme, if I was a whole sort of my thing. So sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to critique your style a little bit, but go ahead. Okay, I'm resetting.

Reggie, it is me, Oopsie Spider-Man. The one time I was bit by a man and then I turned into a still a spider, but my head was a little bit more like a man. I sort of contemplated a lot of existential things now, which has been fucking me up a little bit. How are you doing today?

Great. Thank you. And we are out of time. Thank you so much for coming and sitting on my couch.

How is that? I mean, I have a few notes. It was good. Yeah.

First of all, I think your segments are too short. Do you think? Yeah. I mean, usually a talk show segment lasts. How long are these?

Like seven minutes. You say, yes, seven, eight, somewhere around there. That seemed to be about 15 seconds. Well, I was just thinking I was going to make it nice and small just because I don't know who's listening to it. So it's something like that. So that way, because for me, I've just realized in the world is really made for people, for people.

For people. So it's tough. What else we get that? What is the purpose of spiders? I've always wondered that you see them and you're like, here's here's how the ecosystem was broken down to me. Like everything that you see that's irritating is there so it can eat something else. Well, guess what?

Let's just get rid of all the things.

You know, like spiders are eating like flies and shit. I eat flies too. Let's get rid of the spiders.

Let's get rid of the flies mosquitoes. Let's not even talk about them. All they're there to do is eat something smaller than it. Let's just get rid of all of it. I'll put it this way in the spider community. We've been having a big conversation about how do we get rid of the Scots in the world.

You know what I mean? Hey, don't joke about that. I'm just saying. So it's one of those things where potato potato, a rest in peace to the tail. I was going to say so I'm a little bit worried bringing it up right now. But I, you know, and I'm not suggesting that we commit genocide on every spider. Not a no, not every. I mean, spiders are cool.

You know, they look cool. Thank you, Reggie. They just, you know, they look at them and they're just like, Hey, man, you know, like that's the vibe that I get from a spider. I guess so. Yeah.

They're just like, Hey, look what I can do.

And then they can like, someone can jump crazy or they can make sick webs. What I think is really interesting is you'll see one on the ceiling. Yeah. And you'll sort of swipe at it. And then it falls to the ground. And it's fine. Like if I were to fall that amount of distance, that's like, you know, falling off the Empire State Building or something like that, like they did at the end of sleep list in Seattle. That's true. They did do that.

Yeah. Didn't Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan like, they jumped out in the alternate ending. That is yeah, they had to change it because they didn't realize this could be a popular movie. Yeah, that might kill it. So what I'll say is, before I got human powers, fearless, not afraid of anything.

And I think one thing that has developed, you have fear now, you have fear of death. So cool. I fear of death. Yeah. I sort of understand my existence better. So it's a little bit, I understand what I'm going to lose. And even though I've lost so much, I fear losing more. Yeah.

And are you afraid to get close to people? Because you're afraid of losing them? Well, I married to my wife, who sucks. Oh, yeah.

I hate her. My wife sucks. This is good for stand up if you're about to start stand up.

Because you think? Well, I mean, not sense. I mean, there were, I think there was a popular comedian who talked about how his wife and kid sucked, but he's, he's no, we don't like, like to listen to him anymore. So I think there's like an open lane here. That's true. Listen, I can fill it with being a talk show host. I can fill it with being a stand up. But I really, really want is I want to be an Avenger. That's it. That's all I want. I don't.

Of what? Reggie. Should we tell you the Avengers are fake?

Oh, yeah. The Oh, shit. Yeah. Yes.

I'm too. The Avengers are a fictional. No organization. No, I saw it. Even the people ended are fictional. I saw it in a movie. So it's real. Do we explain documentaries and the difference between? Well, also, like, I guess being new to being a human, like you're just going naturally not know that stuff. Yeah, remember, because they're so convincing. Well, also just the movies in general, like, yeah, the concept. The concept of those because the first people who saw that train coming at them, they were like, that's true.

Really hell out by it. That's true.

Yeah. I'll up in arms. Yeah. What do we do here in this situation? I think I don't know. I mean, I just, I just say, I looked to you for ethical conundments.

I know that. I need guidance.

Well, they call me H and R. Puff and stuff. Yeah. I'm sorry.

You're telling me there's no superheroes in the world. There's no Iron Man. No Hulk. No, no, Angela Merkel.

Angela Merkel. You got the right uncle. Good.

You got a tune. But she sort of people consider her to be a super hero. God, man.

Bjork Bjork. Yeah. She's going to be a Coachella this year.

Yeah. Can she lift an entire building on her back? I don't know. Conceptually. Yeah. So I'm just a freak. There's not, I'm just a freak.

There's nothing I can do. You know, building on your back?

No, you only have one man.

I can sometimes. I think I could if it pushed came to shove.

If I really had to.

Me? Yeah. I say 320, but really 15. That's a wide chasm.

Pretty good. Yeah. But with manpower. So when you say like manpower is when it comes to man strength, is it relative to being a spider, like the scale of the size of a spider?

The proportional. Yeah. Is that the proportional strength?

Getting to the science of it.

Yeah. I have to. I have to. Yeah. So it would be proportional to me. So it would be a fraction, right? So if a man can hold, you know, like eight times his body weight or something like that, I can hold eight times my body weight. I think a man can hold eight times his body weight. 16.

I don't know, Scott. 16's closer. 16's closer.

Why did the man bite you? Can I ask you that? That's a really great question.

Thanks. We skipped over it. I feel like it's a good setup to.

Yeah. Let's try to do it. Is this riddle me this? I don't know.

Sure. Yeah. Sure. Riddler. Oh, this is a good song. Riddler.

That was a good song.

That's a really good song. Okay. So this is riddle me this basically. Like we've we all take turns trying to figure out what the punchline to this could be.

So why did the man bite the spider?

Okay. So Reggie, you have a you have an opportunity to steal.

To get to the other side. To get to the other side. I follow up of what?

You know what I'm saying? Okay. That's pretty good. Very good. Okay. It's coming to me next.

Why did the man bite the spider? Okay. Spiders have eight legs because seven eight nine.

Oh, okay. Yeah. That's really good. Let's go to oopsie spider man.

Why did the man bite the spider? Because he was trying to prove to his stepson that he actually was a man. Is that what really happened? Or are you playing the game? Yeah. His stepson said, as his stepson said, you're not a real man. My dad is a real man. And then he went, oh, what a real man could a real man not do this? And then he tried to bite my head off, but it's so gently because his teeth are sort of like cheese.

Okay. So wait, you were in someone's house and a person was having an argument with his father?

A stepson was having his argument with a stepfather. With a stepfather. You can just call him a person probably was having an argument with his stepfather. I'm sure if we don't need to be specific.

Okay. Okay. So necessarily in every action that he has.

Well, that's sort of, I mean, I spent a lot of time in the house. That's sort of his big personality quality. He just identifies as a stepson. Well, he hates his stepdad. So I would argue that his biggest quality is that he is a stepson. Sure. But he's talking to a stepdad, his stepfather, and the stepfather says, you're not a real man. What precipitates?

The stepson said, you're not a real man. My dad is a real man. Oh, I see. I should. Okay. I, I, he's been sitting on the doorstep every single weekend for the last six years, trying to get, because the mom keeps going, Oh, your dad's coming to pick you up to speak.

Oh, it never comes. It's very exciting. Never comes.

This is a sad story. It's sad. But so he says to the stepfather, you're not a real man.

My dad is a real man. My dad is a real man. And then the stepfather says, would a real man do this?

And to prove he was a real man, bit you in the head? Yeah.

Well, okay. So I should, I should back off, back up for a second. Back off. First of all, you are so close to me right now. And I have this slipper. Oh, Scott, come on. You said you wouldn't do it.

You just said it wouldn't do it. I never said I wouldn't do it. I never probably didn't say that. It was sort of. Okay. You had an energy about you.

So I should back up for a second. The wife. Look, the what let's talk about the wife. Where's the wife and hold? Yeah, well, she's my wife now. So why this is your wife? Oh, yeah, this is my wife.

I just said, you better on him. Listen, I did because you mean the hinge of a door? I met the hinge of a door. Oh, the door and I walked up and I said hello, beautiful. They're on him. What an open you are on a hand on a hidden game recognize game.

That's a great open. I appreciate that. I appreciate that. But so she'd been telling him you got to get that spider in the corner of the bathroom and he kept going. I'll get to it. I'll get to it.

The guy. The one that he bit.

The one that he bit terrified a spider. Terrified a spider.

Well, so then the steps on came in on day. Oh, he was on the can. The steps on came in and goes, I need to get in there. I need to take a shower before work. He's on the can. Yeah, he's on the can. He said, like, he's had a phone.

I'm not great with. No, no, can is a bathroom. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. So you're sitting on the can.

Cans are also headphones. We're wearing those right. We are wearing some of those two. So we couldn't hear the knocking. That was the tough part. Oh, okay. No, he's getting the tiny headphones.

Yeah. Oh, no, my pleasure. Yeah. It's things like that.

People don't think about and I do really appreciate it because otherwise I spend time. I got to run from one earphone to the other ear of the car. Of course. Yeah. We're inclusive this way. Yeah.

I appreciate it. That's why we do this in mono. Yes. Monaco. I'm sorry. We're doing we're taking this in Monaco. Yeah, of course.

Yes. Yes. And the flight was beautiful. Thank you for sharing first class for me. I really appreciate it. Yeah. I had no idea that it would be a little tiny spider on. I thought our guests didn't show up actually because I saw you there. Oh, I know there's a spider in this airplane.

I'm sorry. Who did you think you were booking? I got a really nice email saying from your assistant saying, you know, I'm so excited to have you. We've been trying to get you on the show for a long time. I'm really, really excited that you're coming.

Yeah, we say that to everybody. I'm sorry.

Yeah. I thought I thought we were booking man spider. Oh, I see. Who's a BMX racer? Oh, right.

Very popular right now. I see. Yeah. Okay. I can go. Okay.

Oh, you want me to leave? Don't make me beg you to stay. No, you're what you brought it up. I guess really games you're playing with me.

You say you want to go. I say, okay. And then you get insulted. I'll finish my story and then I'll get out of your hair, Scott, or maybe I'll get into your hair. We'll see what we're doing. Please don't.

So I'm so you sitting on the can, the kids knock, knock, knock, and on the door. And so finally, Bob Dylan did it. Heaven's door. Oh, sure. You're a big fan of that music. That's something that you get when you turn into a man in the head. They're kind of Dylan. And then they watch Yellowstone.

Oh, love Yellowstone. The minute you become a father, the all the offshoots draft day, a lot of costner's catalog. I'm a big fan of the draft days in the Yellowstone universe.

So anyways, he's I thought it was about a bartender, by the way, like draft day. Yeah, it seems so exciting. I'm going to go on and bought a bunch of sportos. Scott, did you see it?

I didn't see it. Oh, shockingly good movie. You were going to like, you're going to go into it, go on. What do I, I know about Griffin Newman's in it. I think so. Anyway, go ahead.

Anyways, I'm sitting in the corner there. I'm watching all this happen. The kid comes in, he goes, I need to use the shower and the dad goes, yeah, well, I'm in here. And the kid goes, well, you're not a real man. My dad is a real man. And he goes, oh, yeah, that's a big jump.

Well, because because he goes, you can't even kill the spider in the corner. And I'm sitting there.

I'm like, how did I get dragged into this? Oh, I see. And the dad goes, he pulls me off and he goes, what your dad do this? And he bites me, but his teeth. That's not the way that you should be killing a spider, but popping it in your mouth. But this guy's a weirdo. We've established that bites me ever so gently and sort of throws me over his shoulder. And does he radioactive?

I can because that's part of the Spiderman thing is that it was a radioactive spider. You know, you know, what's really hard to say, he does work at the nuclear plant. You're reaching the power plant. Oh, you must have been radio. So it's hard to say.

Yeah, how do you know that?

No, no, no big deal. This is the first initial H by any chance. H? Yeah, you know, his stepson named Bart Perroux. I think it was.

And your wife is, of course, the crazy one. So anyway, he does this, you hook up with the mom. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, you know, we're doing well. I sort of put on a big facade that I hate her. But guess what? I don't hate her as much as I say. So you do hate her? Well, I hate her because I tell her my feelings and my feelings are bad. Oh, yeah. So, you know, it's that sort of thing. But, you know, I'm sort of working through some stuff. Yeah, well, like all men. I mean, have you ever considered like a drum circle or something like that? Or, you know, you just like get out all those feelings, you shirtless.

Got it. Would consider a drum circle. But once again, the drums are kind of big and my hands are so I got a bang so hard. I get one good bang in there. And then I got to call it a day.

Yeah. Okay. Yeah. One bang and you're out. So you have the emotional, as Reggie said, incontinence of a man. Yeah. You bottle up everything and then you just like, just fly off the handle and rage torrents. Yeah. Well, and now I know, and now there's nothing I can even channel that into. I was hoping maybe I could, you know, take the Avengers on long walks and give them months listed advice, something like that. And now that's not even an option. You can take it out on your wife, I guess. No, I couldn't do that. Why not?

I hate her, but she's an angel.

Yeah. That's how we all feel. That's that. Hey, you're not alone. That's you're not alone.

That's how every man feels. And now I got this step, son, right? At first, I'm sitting in the corner feeling bad for him. And now I'm dealing with him.

Oh, really? What's he like? He stuff.

Yeah. He's spending a lot of time masturbating in his bedroom. Well, I mean, at least he's doing the best in the standard. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm tiny and I've sort of set up camp at the quarter of his room now. And so it's kind of tough having to have to watch your steps on beat off.

Yeah. I mean, spiders are quick, but not quick enough for a serum to just speed off session. Yeah.

Plus so many eyes. It's hard to cover all of them. Yeah.

Thank you for saying that. I think not a lot of people recognize that, but it is true. Yeah. Well, look, Oopsy Spiderman, you're a fascinating guess. I am glad you made it. I thought we wasted that first class ticket, but I'm glad.

I'm glad. I'm glad. I'm glad. Yeah. We're both glad. Do you guys mean it?

So we're friends. Yeah. We're sort of friends. We're guy friends. Yeah, we're guy friends. And you're not alone when you have all these feelings that guys have. All guys have these. Okay. I'm going to start a text read with us. Murderous rage. Yeah. Sure.

You know, okay. Yeah. Not alone. Not alone.

Oh, and here to welcome me into the guy club, I've given you a poster of a Lamborghini Cuntage.

There you go. Wow. Hey, Reggie. Thank you for printing it in a size that I can in a tiny, tiny little so small tube size of a size of a tiny printer for that too. I appreciate that. Yeah, because I wanted to keep everything authentic. Yeah, he went to a tiny dollhouse where they had a little printer and he said, Hey, can I buy just the printer? And the dolls looked at me blankly, but yeah, printer worked. Okay. Well, that's all you can ask for. And I appreciate it.

It doesn't go unnoticed. Wow. Get a little emotional. A little shut up.

Bottle it down. Stifle it. I'm really sad. You're a man.

You're a man. All right. Well, we need to take a break when we come back. We have a soft drink of representative. I mean, being a spider, you like sticky stuff. You must have tasted soft drinks. Oh, sure. Plenty of times get stuck on my little paws and I can just sort of wrap it up. It's delicious. Yeah, wonderful. Well, we're going to come right back with that.

We have more comedy bang bang with more oopsie spider men more Reggie Watts. We'll be right back with more comedy bang. After this comedy bang bang, we're back. We have Reggie Watts here of Great Falls, Montana.

You may know him from Taskmaster, right? Yeah. I'm trying to think of your other credits.

That pitch perfect too. Pitch perfect too. Pitch perfect as well.

Pitch fair also in Soderberg's Bad Pill. What was that movie? I don't know. I didn't see it.

You know, it was the one about the pill thing or whatever, but they cut me out.

But he had me do it. They had me do his scenes. They cut your ass out.

No, just my ass. But nervous guy. Yeah. You can still see me on the shoot.

Oh, okay. It's just like you have no out. Yeah. Is it scooped out like a nice green scoop?

Yeah. It's the only like unrealistic looking thing in the whole movie.

Right. Wow. But Jude Law. Oh, okay. Yeah. So that covers for it.

We also have oopsie spider man. Spider man. Spider man. Got all the complex thought, but no opposable thumbs. This is a copyrighted song. That's the other thing I want to talk to you about. Yeah. Oh, I see. Well, yeah, you're going to have to come up with the new theme song.

Do you think? Yeah. Reggie, or you know what? Just do it and ride the controversy. Okay.

Do you think maybe that'll give me in the news? Contro posted? Yeah. 100%. Okay. All right. I'll take it. Yeah.

Well, we need to get to our next guest. This is very exciting. He's a soft drink representative, which is Oh, Reggie, you did you get that from him? Did he did? Did you buy enough for everyone?

I'm all introducing insect. Did you buy it? Did you bring enough for everyone or just one for red? I don't have to buy it. I get it for free. But did you bring enough for everyone?

I did not. Oh, okay. Well, let's introduce him. Please welcome Tam Pasture. Hey, everybody.

It is fun to see how the fun is made. You bang the table.

That was very close to oopsie spider man. I guess. Oh, yeah. That's why we're guests. Hello. I'm sorry about that. Oopsie. Yeah, you think because apparently in the in the film, the original Spider-Man, he has all these super powers is super tough, super strong has sort of senses. Those all got dulled when I got there. But that means so I have the response time of now just like a man sort of a 44 year old on the way out.

Oh, is it on the way out? Yeah. It's tough. Well, I'll tell you what could heighten those senses a little caffeine maybe in the form of a Coke zero. All right.

All the excitement and all the sugar.

Okay. So, okay. I like the coch there. Is that who you are representative for is coch here or you just like them and you represent a different coal? I'm a representative for the Coca-Cola company. Scott. Okay. The big one, the big daddy, the big mama. Yeah. Polar bears.

Polar bears. You know them. You love them. Scott.

Absolutely. Unity. That's it. Taco Bell.

Do you have the Taco Bell again or are they a Pepsi company or are they a co-company?

Taco Bell is a Pepsi company. That's right. That's a Pepsi company. The names that they put on the can. They used to put people's names on the can. Yeah. Yes.

Yes. And you would hope you'd get your name. You would hope you'd get your name. Hey, but you know what? If you got someone else's name, that's probably an okay thing too because you jar the memory of someone that you used to know.

That's really? It's also like you're sitting there. We were talking about remote viewing earlier.

It's like you're sitting there talking. You get like Gladys.

Yeah. What percentage was Gladys?

Gladys, we made maybe 40 to 60 of those cans. Okay. So, so say you get Gladys. You're like sitting there going like, I wonder if there's a Gladys out there who's bummed that she didn't get her name.

And suddenly you're thinking about other people instead of being self-centered all the time.

You know what that would start to happen then? People would start to post on different social media sites. Hey, I've got a Gladys. Does anyone have a Gladys? Yes. I would love to exchange.

Not only the cans, Gladys and Gladys are so close too. I bet it comes out of the machine.

You see GL. You're so excited. Yep. And then it's Addis. I know, I know. That is the definition of heartbreak right there. Yeah. So close. What a wonderful campaign. Why aren't you doing that anymore? You know what? I guess we thought, well, we went to a different campaign with numbers.

All right. We were just doing numbers. Okay. It feels like there's 348. Yes. Yes. We went up to 500. Initially, we were like, well, let's say, let's just like get like zero to 100. Maybe someone's in, you know, their age, right? Or the day they were born.

Oh, yeah. We're doing birthdays. We're doing birthdays. Yeah, we do like 890. We're doing like street addresses for a minute. We tried that for a little bit, but I'll tell you what, we had several lawsuits filed against us. Oh, yeah.

Because we would start to put, if we knew the name of who lived there, we would put that on the can, too, because we're like, this person is going to love. You're a doc. Yes. We were doxing people. And that turned out to be problematic. And we had to stop that almost immediately.

Yeah. When you say almost immediately, how long did it run?

Well, it ran for about a year and a half. And that's too long. Too long. But when you get to notice that you should stop it from a lawyer, yeah, but you can't go another. Yeah. But you're like, do this person mean to send this to us?

Or you got to get that clear. Yeah. But now they are collectors items.

Man, I would love to see if mine is out there somewhere.

Yeah. We'll get yourself on social media, post about it. Maybe someone else that you can start to.

Yeah. Oh, okay. I'll post my address.

And yes. Anyone have this can? Yeah. With this address. Wow.

So what are you, what are you here to do? I mean, are you here to spread the word about Coca-Cola? We all love it.

Reggie, you enjoying that Coke Zero? I love Mizzero. Yeah.

You're from Montana, though. You're not from Mizzero. Nope. Not at all. Okay. Reggie, can I ask you a question? Yeah. Yeah. What made you choose Coke Zero? What a polite young man. Can I ask you a question? I haven't asked you that this entire time. Hey, man, consent. Right. Consent is cool, finally. Yeah, finally. Yeah.

What makes you choose a Coke Zero over, say, a Diet Coke?

Oh, that's so delicious.

Okay. So what's the difference? Because the Diet Coke doesn't have what doesn't have sugar.

Diet Coke has its own particular taste. All right. It's the only difference the taste, because they both don't have sugar, right? They both don't have sugar. That is correct. You can enjoy without the guilt of added sugars. But then what's the, what's, why then the zero?

Well, we want to let people know there's zero sugar, but also this isn't Diet Coke. This isn't your daddy's Diet Coke. Oh, okay. But my daddy, it's still okay if he drinks Diet Coke, right?

It's okay. Can I tell my daddy that it's okay? Yeah, you can tell your daddy that. Absolutely.

He could send him an email. Okay. All right. I like that.

Also check to see what can he has.

Maybe he's got that Coke. Okay. Yeah. Can't with your adjust. Anyway, Scott, I got in my forerunner drove down here to Monaco. You drive a forerunner.

Mm-hmm. Toyota.

Yeah. That was Toyota 2018. Okay. I was thought that was Nissan. Sorry. No Nissan Pathfinder.

2018. You've had it for five years or so. So it's not a lease. It's not a lease. I own it outright.

You want it? Oh, so you paid it off already? I paid it off last week. Okay. Congratulations.

Thank you. Awesome. Boys in our car talk. All right. Treating myself to a slice.

Oh, okay. Is that like the drink? Okay. Yeah. Not a, yeah.

Not a, what? No, not a slice of not a pizza. Not a pizza. No, you didn't go to New York suddenly. I love Scott. What are you talking about? That's why I love this show so much. It's so fun. I'm a huge fan. Scott, well, welcome to the show. Thank you. And that's my fan.

Absolutely. That's why I'm here today.

Oh, because you're a fan or I thought you said you were here for some other reason. Coca-Cola.

Would like to sponsor Comedy Bang Bang. What? Comedy Bang Bang. Comedy Bang Bang. Oh my God.

Oh my God. What do we have to do to do? We have to change the name to Coca-Cola Bang Bang or Scott, you keep being yourself. You keep wearing this wonderful show. But every episode, you go ahead and enjoy an ice cold Coca-Cola or maybe introduce one of our new flavors while you're at it. Oh, what are the? Yeah, I would like. I mean, right now I know the Coke flavor.

Yes. There's the Diet Coke flavor. Yeah. Cherry. Cherry.

Cherry. There's vanilla.

Yeah. There's black cherry. Black cherry. Oh, good call.

What's the difference between cherry and black cherry? Tartness. Tartness. I give one word. Yeah, it's like my friend Carl. Yes. Yes. Also, very funny. We love him on the show. We love him to also promote some of this Coca-Cola delicious. He'd love to do that. All right. So what are the new flavors? Well, Scott, coming up first, we're going to release a brand new flavor.

Now you like the crisp, cold, refreshing taste of a Coca-Cola classic, wouldn't you say? I do. You got why did you bring so many for Reggie and none for the rest of us? Sorry. I knew Reggie was a real Cokehead.

So I thought I better go ahead and give him a few. We all know Reggie is a Cokehead. Yes.

So, truth. But if we're going to go ahead and add a little new twist to this cold, crisp, refreshing Coca-Cola classic, why don't we add something else that's cold, crisp, and refreshing.

And that is nothing else other than iceberg lettuce.

The cold, crisp, refreshing flavor mixed with the cold, crisp, refreshing texture of iceberg lettuce.

Can you feel that in your mouth right now? You feel that in there, swishing around, and caught between your teeth a little bit. I don't know.

Do you have one?

You better believe I do. Okay, Reggie, do you want to open that up?

Oh, good. This one, there's three of them for all of us.

You have thanks.

Thanks for doing the tiny size, by the way. That was kind of you.

Oh my god.

Well, very crunchy. Yes.

Crunchy is like eating a Caesar salad in a way without all the stuff you like on a Caesar salad.

Yes. Not wilted. No. Surprisingly.

To be honest, I expected it to be wilted. Normally, any time you ever eat a salad, it's wilted. It's wilted. It's jambrelin. Listen, this is coming from somebody who seen two of his own children. This is an interesting flavor.

Thank you. Were your children not interesting?

Some of those interesting flavors? Blans. I kind of expected what the taste was going to be.

Not about me. Don't worry about it. Okay. All right.

Well, I mean, it's definitely, I mean, it's very leticy.

It's a lot like a burger wrap. Yes. But again, without the stuff that you enjoy.

With all the calories. Yeah. With all the calories.

Yeah. No, lettuce is very good for you. And honestly, I feel the didai coming on.

So the roughage element to it is really good. We've added fiber to this particular cola.

All right. Yeah. So first. Really, I mean, when I hear cola, I think colon.

And so to have it clean it out like that is, is, you know, it's very expedient.

Yeah. I'll go ahead and say, I don't taste any Coca-Cola in here.

Yeah. It's just, it's just like a can of lettuce. Yeah. We've definitely, this is good. This is good feedback to get before we do the soft launch.

Are you going to do a lot? When you say a soft launch, you mean just a soft drink launch?

Yep. You're just launching into the world. Absolutely. I think it's maybe tastes like a green juice with just the juice lettuce. Yeah. It's like, yeah, it's like, it hasn't been blended yet or anything. Yeah. I'm going to take that back to Atlanta. It's like the headquarters.

A half of a McDial T. Yeah. The healthy half. The cold side.

Yeah. There we go. The cold side.

The cold side is definitely cold in this. I will say these have been in your forerunner, I can tell because they're like room temperature at this point. Yes. Yes. And they've also been kind of on an adventure because this forerunner's got four wheel drive and I've been off-roading.

What have you been doing? I just been trying to get through streams, going through creeks, dry riverbed in California. Yes. Sounds like you're a cold crisp seeker.

Yes. Cold crisp adventure seeker. Now, that's who this cold is made for in particular.

Okay. Except this is warm and it's not a drink really. It's eating lettuce. Yes.

For now. For now. Yes. But literally it's a straw element that'll feel more like a beverage.

Oh, okay. Interesting. Do you have any other flavors?

Scott, you better believe I got some other flavors for you, my friend.

Now, it's not just Coca-Cola. Okay. We've also got Sprite.

Sprite is part of the Coca-Cola family.

Seven up is part of the Pepsi family, sir.

Seven up is part of its own family. Oh, it has its own family.

Oh, I didn't. Never knew that. Never knew that. Never had it. Never will.

I've never had it. You've never had a seven up.

I haven't. Never will. Oh my God. Well, you got to see one through six up first.

For it to make sense. You're right. I've gotten it four.

I guess I just said that. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's usually what we're paying out.

Let me ask you a question now. Are you familiar?

Yeah. Before you asked us if you could ask a question, now you're just like kind of being bossy about it. I've earned your trust with the lettuce, Coke, collab. And now you're just going for it.

Okay. Let's stop mince and words and mince and veggies.

Let's get to the next one. Are you fan of ruffles, potato chips?

Does it? I don't know. Does that bridge?

They have ridges. Yeah. They definitely have ridges. They got a bunch of ridges.

I mean, I'll have a crumb if it falls in my past.

Okay. Yeah. I had one ruffle that just had one ridge.

What? It was flat and then had a little bump in the middle.

Well, I mean, that sounds like a kettle cooked chip that maybe accidentally just full of milk. It might have been a kettle cooked. It might have wrinkled like a one-lank old.

I was at a Cheeto that looked like Abraham Lincoln once.

Wow. Yeah. It had the top hat and it was long and skinny and had essentially, it was essentially like a normal Cheeto. It just like, I imagine when I looked at it, that it kind of looked like Abraham Lincoln. Did you send it to the Smithsonian?

I did. Yeah. Yeah. They put it on Archie Bunker's chair.

Makes sense. Someone sat on it. That's the place.

I mean, he ate a lot of junk food on that chair.

I think he did. He was the one that kind of pioneered the whole like barca lounge or exactly. Yeah. So why did you ask us that question?

Because if you like ruffles, there's a good chance you love ruffles loaded potato chips.

Whoa. Okay. Now you're speaking my language, AKA English.

Yeah. Okay. Well, if you like ruffles loaded potato chips, you're going to love Coca-Cola loaded and we're talking baked potato. No. Okay.

So roughly, this is not have anything to do with the ruffles corporation.

That is nothing to do with. It's a collaboration much in the same way that we'll collaborate with certain restaurants, not Taco Bell, not pizza, but we'll collaborate with other brands to bring some new products. You say it is a collaboration. So it does have something to do with the ruffles corporation? It does. But does they say they like potato chips, but does taste like a load of baked potato? So it's not branded ruffles, but it is rigid.

It's a Coca-Cola product. The can is rigid. Okay. All can.

No flax.

Usually rigid. Yeah. I just dropped that can and it was a thud of no reverberation.

Okay. Well, that can. Wow. All right. What do you, what do they mean? That was the can?

The can? Yeah. The can is made out of a, you know, when you're going to have a loaded potato, what do you usually have it on plate? We're going, okay.

That's right. You usually have it on plate.

All right. And that place usually made out of ceramic.

These are ceramic.

Ceramic cans? Yes. They're all. And you made these unique ceramic cans because ruffles have ridges. And you said if we make the can rigid, it'll make sense. It'll be like a ruffles potato chip in which they have the loaded potato flavor. Okay.

This makes sense to me. Let's just try these.

I mean, why are we?

Crack it open. Crack it open.

So dry. It's like a very dry. It's a, I think you got the formula wrong on this one. This is just potato. No loaded. Oh, no bacon bits. No sour cream. I hear you're coming from. I hear where you're coming from. Very dry. Very dry. You're like, you know what? This side tastes like a side.

Well, let me tell you what, let's give you a man. We've got Coca Cola, Porterhouse steak. Why don't you crack one of those open. They are juicy. If you're so dry right now, they are juicy as all get out. Oh, God. Well done. Well done. Medium rare.

Okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's delicious, but it's I don't like the texture. Wow. Mm hmm. Tough texture. Yeah, it's a tough texture. Okay. Well, then I'll tell you what, if you're going to have some red meat, you know, pairs well with a red meat, what a red wine. We've got ourselves a Coca Cola Pinot Noir. Why don't you go ahead and ask us to mix a little bit of Cabernet in there.

This is more. That's great. This is no flavor at all. None.

This reminds me of a Zima. Yes. Yeah.

Yeah. I actually think it's just red wine. It's mostly red wine. We had to remove some of the most of the Coca Cola because there was a reaction between the two they would separate.

And they would all go in the vinegar? Yes. Very much so.

And it also created a simmering effect, which we were not anticipating. Oh, and that kind of led to some difficulties with the canning process. So we removed nearly all the Coca Cola.

Okay. And we just left with a so I was here in the war. You say mostly red wine. What is the rest of it? Oh, the rest of it?

The rest of it is going to be well, it's because we had a very weirdly defensive about this.

Okay. Well, you know what? I'm the one who's in. I mean, I know these ideas.

Okay. It can't be as embarrassing. I remember when Coca Cola first came out, they put cocaine in it originally. And that's why people loved it so much.

And that's embarrassing? Oh, I mean, it's embarrassing to the crowd.

They don't like people talking about it. I'm surprised you're talking about it.

Okay. Well, I think it's okay to acknowledge our history and people did love the product.

That's the time. Not sure we've learned something since then, but I mean, you know what's in the red line? Okay. But just real quick, before you ask one person who likes cocaine and you tell me if they are embarrassed by it or if they have a problem with that, if they have a problem with cocaine.

As one person who likes cocaine, if they got a problem with cocaine, if they're embarrassed by it or if they have a problem with it. Yeah.

I'm going to tell you what, right now, they don't.

I don't know that I can rustle up someone who likes cocaine at this later.

Also, everybody I've talked to that says that they like cocaine, since they do not have a problem with it. So.

There we go. So is it cocaine?

Is it cocaine? There's a bit of cocaine in this Coca Cola red wine.

Just say that. Okay. I don't know what I'm putting in my body.

That's not going to make it so better.

Okay. There we go.

All right. Three more cans. There we go.

And this is a healthy amount of cocaine.

See, this is a winner. This is the one that I like.

I think there we go. And they like this one.

All right. Well, I'll tell you what.

Because it's making me drowsy, but very awake.

I think we should organize the studio.

I think we should clean and reorganize the studio.

Yeah. Great idea.

I don't think this is just cocaine.

No. What do you think else?

What do you think else?

And that means.

Ritalin? Ritalin? Yeah.

Like prescription drugs you would find in someone's medicine.

We had to temper the cocaine effects with a little something that's going to focus you a little bit more.

So yes, we needed the.

I'm drowsy. I'm wide awake. I want to organize things.

The wine made people draw us.

We had to up it with the cocaine.

And then we had to even it out with the ritalin.

I'm getting a little bit of a Lunesta flavor as well.

Bit of a Lunesta flavor.

There's also a Lestra because my stomach is grumbling and I have to shit.

Yes. Absolutely.

Before I settle that.

Might have been the iceberg.

All right.

But I'm feeling a little better.

So I'm guessing well butrin as well.

Well butrin's in there.

Well.

Absolutely.

Asempic.

A tiny amount of ozempic but not too much that you're going to be overwhelmed by it.

I also feel my cholesterol is going down.

So there's there's.

It's going down but it's also going up.

I see.

Okay.

And there's like like look at a mean maybe a little sort of little.

Yeah.

Well that's the horse confidence right there.

Yeah.

There's 400 perin-de-pedamine.

Also I've really started to hallucinate.

So I think there's some acid in there as well.

Oh my jaw is very tight.

Now you're getting to the sweet moments of this.

Yes.

Absolutely got a little bit of acid in there.

Okay.

I'm talking to a ghost right now.

I'm pretty sure.

What's that?

That would be me.

Wait are you a ghost?

Holy shit.

Hold on.

You're a ghost.

Just Coca-Cola.

You're a ghost.

Why didn't you lead with this?

I didn't want that to overshadow the new products that we're trying along.

How are you driving this forerunner?

Tell you what those things practically drive themselves.

Scott you got to get one.

That's guessless.

Oh no they are not.

They never will be they don't need to be.

All right.

Yeah.

When did you die?

I died nine years ago.

No.

Okay.

No.

So is that why the cans are so warm?

Yes.

They've been so warm.

Oh no.

For the pandemic.

Man I'll tell you what.

I had myself a barks, a barks root beer.

And what happened?

You know how they say barks is the one with bite?

Yeah.

That's their slogan.

I mean slogan.

Yeah.

I'll tell you what.

There are some sharp edges to that can and they slice into my tongue and I bled out like you wouldn't believe.

Oh.

Yeah.

You know I'm on your own tongue.

I've heard of that.

Barks bit me.

I mean I couldn't recover.

No.

Yeah.

Died right there in my forerunner.

Oh that's why you're able to get it to drive it or is it a ghost forerunner?

A ghost forerunner.

Yes.

I got a new model because I died nine years ago with the forerunner.

Oh that's right.

Right.

You traded it in.

So the ghost.

Yeah.

Ghost.

Yeah I've since traded it in.

But you paid it off last week?

Yes.

To who?

Jesus?

Yeah.

Trust me.

I didn't go to heaven.

Oh.

Well you're still.

Yeah.

You're still down here.

You're still here.

Yes.

That's terrible to say no heaven.

No.

I got to get some of these sales done before I get to the great upstairs.

Terrible.

You still have to worry about money when you're dead.

Desperately, desperately.

I have got myself a condo just outside of Atlanta and the prices in the south.

You think hey I'm going to move to Atlanta because the price there are lures.

They are not skyrocketing.

Every.

We miss the window.

Yeah.

Now can I just say you seem quite corporeal at this point.

Are you re-animating yourself?

What's going on here?

Can we poke through you at all or do you want my try?

What's them rules?

You can poke through me a little bit but I do have a little bit of texture.

Pull it out.

Yeah.

That's uh no you're you're definitely I can feel you.

You're not like the ghosts that I normally.

But sick like that mashed potato drink.

Yeah.

That's right.

I tell you what what I did was.

Think of two C's.

In order to try to give myself a little bit more of a of a tangible quality to myself.

I grabbed some tab colas also Coca-Cola products.

Oh they love that.

That's right.

They love tab.

And I grabbed your.

I got your a track.

Your goal.

Weight drink.

The trader never Coca-Cola till I die.

Grab some tab colas before they went off the shelves.

And if you let those age a little bit they do gain.

They have like a gummyness.

Stickingness.

Is that what I was poking?

They gain gummyness as we're saying.

They gain gummyness through time.

Got it.

So I was just poking like old tab.

Yeah.

Residue.

Yeah.

Okay.

Interesting.

Wow.

Can I ask a question?

You scout was able to poke through you but you see why you got a good consent.

That's what I'm learning here today.

You see.

You're finally learning about consent.

Wow.

You're a man.

Thank you so much.

You didn't have to say that and I appreciate that.

So we seem to be able to poke through you but you seem to be able to hold and interact with the Coca-Cola products.

Yes.

And that's a magic of Coca-Cola.

All right.

They're not just for you or for you.

Ghosts can touch Coca-Cola.

Is that the one thing that people can touch it?

They can buy it.

They can taste it.

They can love it.

Wow.

That's incredible.

Color me impressed.

Yeah.

You tell me a Pepsi product that can do that and I will call you a huge liar.

Get out of my face and get out of my car.

And into my dreams.

Oh, absolutely.

Yeah.

Getting the backseat, baby.

I don't want to experience that so I'm not going to bring up any Pepsi products at all.

Yeah.

If I'm a ghost, I'm probably just going to like hang out in like women's locker rooms and stuff like that.

Oh, yeah.

That's right.

Yeah.

That's right.

Yeah.

You're supposed to actually.

Yeah.

I think so.

Yeah.

To just like help them with the towels.

Yeah.

You know, assist them.

And be like, oh, you left yours.

You know, you left your backpack.

You know, yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, no.

You dropped your phone in between the lockers.

Yeah.

That's one that when creeps are coming, you know.

Yeah.

You're coming.

Get bored.

Cabbity creeps.

Creep.

So I probably won't be doing a lot with Coke stuff, but I'll be too busy with that.

Well, never say never, Scott.

You don't know what's going to happen when you die.

You know, you might just find yourself knee deep in a nice, delicious, cherry Coke Zero.

I hope I'm not knee deep, but all right.

Well, how about this?

Butterscotch Coca-Cola.

Huh.

Okay.

That actually sounds great.

Yeah.

Everything is.

It's almost like your ideas are deescalating.

I got it though.

Butterscotch, right?

Butterscotch.

We're at iceberg lettuce.

We went to bake potato.

Plant up the cake.

Okay.

These are all in kind of the same world.

And then wine, which is a bad amount of lunch.

Sorry, but it was delicious.

And now butterscotch, which is a nice, delicious.

I like to come in hot and I like to only cool.

Yeah.

Just like a nice cold Coca-Cola.

There we go.

Well, look, Tam, Tam pasture, who's a ghost, who works for the, are you receiving checks from the Coca-Cola?

I am receiving.

Well, my parents are receiving checks.

I see.

They are receiving the checks.

They cash them.

They pay back your debt.

Yes.

My enormous debt.

Well, they're the ones who paid off your forerunner.

I would imagine.

Yes.

The forerunner is under their name.

Okay.

And they do get to drive it on the weekends.

Oh, cool.

Yes.

Where do they go on the weekends?

Oh, they go to, hey, have you ever been in the Smoky Mountains?

I don't think so.

Where are those?

Oh, it doesn't sound fun.

Yeah.

Well, the Smoky Mountains are in the south.

All right.

There's a small slash middle east of the country.

Okay.

So they drive there on the weekends and come back?

From Atlanta.

They drive there on the weekends.

They, yes.

Well, they drive there on one weekend.

They come back another weekend.

So they've got the conference about a week.

You know what? I'm not interested.

Um, all right.

We're running out of time.

I'm sorry.

Look, sometimes I ask questions that I'll leave down just the most boring evidence.

I got one more Coke flavor for you.

Okay.

Coke and lime.

Okay, that exists.

So people use a flavor.

Yeah, that does sound most familiar.

That exists.

Okay.

All right.

Look, we're running out of time, guys.

We only have time for one final.

I'm sorry, Reggie, but you know how it is.

Oh, I was just talking my language.

You just did an impression of me.

That was crazy.

You love it.

He's a ghost.

We only have time for one final feature here on the show.

And that's a little something called plugs.

Oh, yeah.

That's right.

Sitting on the front porch, sipping pink lemonade.

Hop up on my bike and got it made.

In the shade.

Cruising around the neighborhood to let you all know.

There's a rock and party and we all have got to go.

It's so cool to down.

Keep it up.

Pour it out and fill your cup.

It's pluggy, plug day.

It's time to plug away.

It's pluggy, plug day.

It's time to plug away.

Yeah.

Yeah, that was pluggy, plug day by Michael Golden.

Boy, that was first of all, Reggie was performing all the instruments.

Yeah, most of them.

My money drops.

Yeah.

But that was speaking your language.

Like pour it out into a cup.

Oh my gosh.

You're getting very excited during that.

I'm pretty thirsty right now.

And I just might have to crack open a regular coca-cola.

How's that for a flavor?

There's a cancellation.

We're back in zero.

Not Coke zero, of course.

Absolutely not.

That's weird.

Guys, what are we plugging?

Reggie, you have obviously 44 more shows.

44 more shows.

With the James Corden show, April 28th.

It sounds like it's the final episode.

That's the final episode.

The final episode.

The song.

Are you going to sing to James on that middle?

Oh, you should do that.

That's a good thing for the reminder.

I think I'm going to do that.

Good.

Now I'm going to do that.

Yeah.

Okay.

Good.

Yeah, before I just going to leave.

Now you do like sing to him on the desk.

I'm going to do it.

Yeah, I'm going to do it.

Yeah, exactly.

Find a really perfect song to this.

I will.

Yeah, I will.

Probably meet me halfway.

Damn, I wish I was your lover.

Oh, okay.

Or that one.

Yeah.

Sophie B. Hawkins.

Oh, yeah.

So, yeah.

Sophie B.

Oh, because that's what Sophie.

That's like women B shopping.

Yeah.

She had a name like that.

Like Sophie's B.

Hawkins.

What?

These songs that she sings.

Was she, I guess, was she, I guess she was like one of those.

What do you call those people that have things on their line that they sell?

Oh, those are called women.

Those are called women.

Okay.

I didn't know that.

We also, you have a great Falls, Montana, is going to be out in the calendar year or in the fiscal year.

It'll be in the, yeah, it'll be soon.

Spring.

Wonderful.

And also the comedy bang bang book.

You're a boy.

Yeah.

CBBB.

All right.

And, uh, oopsie spider man.

Spider man.

Again.

Started out an oopsie spider boy.

And now I'm getting older.

Okay.

So you're a boy.

Emotionally.

Oh, god.

Okay.

So we all know that way sometimes.

What I would love to plug is, uh, Lufonza Airlines, because there were two empty first-class seats and they very easily could have, uh, upsold them.

Uh, but really it was me a spider.

And this ghost guy flying out to Monica to do it yourself.

I was going to say there were two empty seats the entire time.

And those flight attendants, and somebody tried somebody said they're empty.

Let me come sit here and the flight attendant said no.

Absolutely not.

Good for them.

Scott Ockerman paid for these seats.

And so they will remain empty.

It's like Bono paying for his hat.

Yeah.

For another seat for his hat is what I meant to say.

Oh, sure.

Yeah.

Obviously paid for his hat.

Listen, I was going to agree hard with you, even though I did not understand the reference.

So, you know when Bono paid for his hat?

Sure.

That's been a story.

It was unbelievable.

Unbelievable.

Um, so, uh, Lufonzan, uh, how do you pronounce it again?

Just Renza.

Oh, Renza.

Renza.

Influenza.

Gotcha.

Influenza.

No other plugs.

No.

Okay.

And a Tam pastor.

What do you want to plug?

I'd like to back up that influenza airlines.

Uh, friendliest, uh, wings in the sky.

And they have a nice plethora of Coca-Cola products on there.

Yeah.

And then if you also want to check out the new night court, someone might have a little part in that.

Okay.

Oh, the...

Okay.

Yeah.

And if you want to also keep your eye out for a Geico commercial shot in 2021, and still hasn't aired yet, but someone is still getting a holding fee for it.

So maybe it'll come out in 2023.

We'll see how that's all plays out.

Wow.

Okay.

Well, if I were watching the commercial, what would happen in it?

There's a plot.

It will be an office setting.

It'll be an office setting.

Oh, yay.

And I don't want to give it too much else away.

But just Pam maybe fall in love with you.

Oh, oh.

Could you imagine if that ever happened?

Rear.

Well, I want to plug, look, we talked about the Comedy Bang Bang book.

Pre-orders right now.

What are you going to plug?

Uh, oh, uh, yeah, I was going to plug that maybe.

I'm not sure though.

I'm too afraid.

That's okay.

It's like something.

Shut up.

Go for it.

Yeah.

Yeah, this ship is leaking.

I'm a coward.

No, no, no.

No, no.

How can I do it?

Really?

Come on.

Okay.

Come on.

Um, yeah.

Is that what people say to ghosts?

They only do say that.

I never realized out to Pasteur.

Kind of helped.

How I propose.

Oh, yeah.

I'm going to put each of your addresses and phone numbers and pictures on a Coca-Cola again.

We're shipping it out there.

Oh, thank you.

We have a little missing thing on mine.

So it's almost like a milk carton in a way.

You got it, my friend.

All right, wonderful.

Oopsie Spiderman.

One last thing.

No, no, no, no.

Oh my God.

I hate spiders.

Mine.

Spiderman.

Now I'm dead and I'm a ghost too.

Dang.

What good is Barney, pal?

Looks like the Pasteur has a new companion.

All right, great.
