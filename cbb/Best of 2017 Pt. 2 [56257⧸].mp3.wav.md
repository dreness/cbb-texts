♪♪♪ Yonder, Fonda, beyond the pond there, you'll find a kind of unminded diner who's shy from grinder because her, in case her pry and child, her finder...

Oh, God. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

I mean, I mean...

Come on. That's tough. That's a tongue twister. Let me try it again.

Here we go. Yonder, Fonda.

I couldn't even do it a second time.

Third time, we all heard it. It's just like Alyssa Milano would say. It's the charm.

Here we go. Yonder, Fonda, beyond the pond there.

You'll find a kind of unminded diner who shies from grinder in case her pry and child...

her child did finder. Forget it.

Anyway, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Thanks to the Voblics for that catchphrase submission.

Thanks a lot, the Voblics.

Yeah, you'd think you'd make these things easier to say.

Yeah. It attracted my eye. I said, I don't need to practice this before I say it.

This is one take. Just like Lionel Richie singing hello.

Scott, you are like Icarus of old. Your hubris brought you down.

Ah, yes. I wish there was a more modern reference than Icarus.

I wish that a person from today would build wax wings and fly.

Because then we could just mention him. You're like Josh.

Yeah, yeah.

Who flew too close to the sun.

The wax wings. Talk me through that. How did that work?

Yeah, exactly. First of all, was he in prison or something?

That's how they were getting out of prison. What was the deal with Icarus?

Do you recall? It was him and his dad?

His dad flew with him, right? And his dad was like, hey Icarus, don't fly too close to the sun. Remember we're wearing wax?

Hey Icarus.

Hey, you son of a bitch.

I don't really know.

You don't call him my wife a bitch.

I don't really know. All I know about Icarus is this.

He wanted to fly. He built wax wings. He flew too close to the sun.

They melted. And it was like in your face, Icarus, you're not supposed to be flying.

Right. I think there's some sort of prison component to it.

By the way, engineer Cody Ryan, did you look up the things we asked you to look up last time?

You looked up Hanukkah. I remember that. But then we asked you to look up something else, right? Lyric, some lyrics.

Some lyrics. Yes, that's right. It was lyrics. It was sending the clowns. Isn't it nice? Isn't it nice?

Isn't it nice sending the clowns? By the way, welcome to the show.

This is Comedy Bang Bang, Best of Part Two.

I'm Scott Ockerman. I'm your host and I'm sitting across my co-host for these Best ofs, as he has been for many a year. Paul F. Tomkins is here.

It's me. I'm here. You are here. Yeah. I was worried you were not here.

You're here. Were you worried that I was not here, but you were seeing me?

That is, yes. Look, there's all sorts of unidentified phenomena that people are seeing these days.

Very hung up on this. Well, I mean, aliens are out there.

Well, they mean aliens. I mean, I love you. I love you.

That's by the way that a lot of people when they do what the Allen impressions, and they're all the rage now. We have to admit. I love doing it.

People do the nebish Woody Allen. I do the Woody Allen when he's in bed with Mario Hemingway or whatever, where he gets all soft. He's like, I love you.

You mean the world to me? The whiny. Yeah, the like, I'm good to soften my voice.

Woody Allen, Woody got right. You want the Frank Sinatra?

I can't believe it. Just lyrics. They're the same no matter who sings it.

Lyrics to songs are the same no matter who sings it. That is not true.

Even weird out. Exactly. I just don't have anything that's sending the clowns. Isn't it nice?

That's the part that's what we're asking is if it was a lyric to send in the clowns.

Well, that's what that's what that's what Scott was asking.

This is a this is a last episode. Yes. I know. This is the last episode you're doing.

You're firing. I'm bringing in Sam. I'm bringing in Sam next time.

Oh, shit. Do you want me to call him? Yeah, call Sam. All right. I want Sam.

Hey, welcome to the show. Scott Augerman, I'm your host.

Paul of Thompkins is here. Yeah, Paul of Thompkins. And Ryan is fired after this episode. Scott is fired, Ryan. Can you come in and record the next best of?

Yeah, that'd be great. What?

No, there's no overtime if that's what he asks. Yeah, he did that. There's no overtime.

There's no holiday pay. Yeah, the payment is just the.

You get to keep your job. You get to keep your job. That's what he says. Yeah. All right.

Yeah. Is he is he going to is he coming? Yeah, he's coming.

He's coming. Okay, cool.

You're fired, but you got to finish out your shift here on the show. Okay. Welcome to the show.

The look, let's be honest, you're not listening to this at all. This isn't your first episode of comedy, Bang, Bang. I would imagine you probably listened to part one that came out on Monday, Christmas Day. Scott, shut up a second. Do you know what happened though? I saw on Twitter.

I'm furious at you. Somebody saying that they listened to the best ofs and that got them into the show.

Yes, but I'm saying part two of the best ofs is not your first episode. That would be weird.

That would be weird. But I wasn't. It came out on a Thursday. I don't know that I never seen that before and I was happy to see that. I was happy to see that. I did see that myself. It does work. People, you know what else worked, I will say, is we had a guest on an episode recently, not eligible for this year's best ofs. And some people wish it were because it was a fantastic episode. But Neil Patrick Harris was on the episode a couple of weeks ago.

And what had the way he described the way he got into the show was he read the New York Times article about episode 500. And I believe episode 500 may have been his first episode that he ever listened to. And then he got into it. And I'll tell you, and I think I told you this, Paul, but he gave a very compliment that was very funny to me because it's not one that I normally hear.

But he said, I love how long the show is. Yes. Which is not something that I heard him say.

Normally he says. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But he was just like, a lot of podcasts, you've turned them on. They're over in like 20 minutes. And then it's like, what else do you listen to?

He's got a lot of free time on his hands. I wanted to know what podcast he was listening to.

That are just 20? Yeah. I get way like the daily, maybe it's something like that or something.

I don't know. There's a lot of podcasts out there. Honestly, Paul, have you noticed now people like the New York Times or New York Magazine now they are doing their best of podcasts lists.

And they're all these highfalutin. Yes. These like, you know, they all have to be educational.

Exactly. You're not going to learn anything listening to this show. It's a bunch of NPR horseshit. Horseshit. They all sound exactly the same. Yes.

With their measured voices, and they don't like to raise their voices above a whisper.

But I wasn't satisfied. What he said didn't make sense. So I had to go back and ask somebody else. That's my least favorite type of post. Yeah. The one where they sort of have a question mark at the end of every. They have like a mystery that they're trying to solve. I wasn't satisfied.

I had to answer more questions.

So I went back and I asked questions. But why would he be there? And at that time?

And how come he wasn't able to say why you can do this right? Now, Paul, you, there are, of course, people who are imitating the way that we do this show. I'm sure just like, Consea yelling, blah, blah, blah. Well, that's most, that's most podcast. That's most podcast.

Yeah. Is people constantly yelling yelling? Yelling the herd. That's what you're going to get with this. There's nothing educational about our show. It's, it's a bunch of fucking flim flam and bullshit.

But at least it's going to pass the time and it'll be fun for you.

Is that, is that's a good way to think of, of this show, right? Imagine if this podcast were in a box that would be on the back of the box. Right. Yeah. Look, it's a bunch of flim flam and bullshit. Bunch of bullshit. But at least it passes the time.

And a lot of it, according to Neil Patrick Harris. That's right. I have to say that was thrilling to hear. And, and this show has people who are well known who like to listen to it. Yes.

And some of them have asked to be on the show and have succeeded very well. And we may be hearing from some of those people in our countdown today. Oh, but it's always nice to hear that someone has listened to, someone read about it, then listen to it and then got it. Because usually you can get two of those. That's right. You know, you can, someone will read about it, someone will listen to it. And usually it's the old turnoff after five minutes.

So if you're listening, let's describe exactly what happens on this show.

This is the show where we talk to you. Very established.

There's no way this is your second.

This is your first time listening to the show. Yeah. Go back and listen to part one first.

But now let's recap what the show is. The show where we talk to interesting people, full stop. It's we hit upon it this year and it's our tagline.

I don't know that it's surviving into 2018. I'm sure people wish I would retire.

Like you're sick of saying it?

Probably. That's what that's a lot of what comedy bang bang is, is me latching on to something and saying it until I get sick of it. But I will say not before the audience is sick of it.

That's true. It's usually a good two month period where people are like, okay, knock it off.

I like the obstinency of that. Yes. I don't care what the people think about this show.

I instead want to rub their noses in. Because it also feels like I don't want to do it either, but I'm going to keep doing it because you don't like it.

It's a little bit of that.

No, this is the show where we will have on I'm the host of it every week.

Yeah. And I'll have on celebrities and comedians and people who are in the news. Not really anyone is in the news usually, although people have become in the news after they've been on the show. Well, you had to ditch that Mark Halpern episode.

That's true. Oh boy.

And then we have on comedians playing fake people.

Sometimes they're doing impressions of real people. And sometimes they're doing people that they've constructed out of whole cloth.

And Paul of Tomkins is on the show. He's been on 11 times in the eligibility period of 2017.

And he primarily when he's on, he does characters. That means I missed a month.

Yeah, that's true. That is interesting. I wonder which one you I'll have to go back through the stats and figure out like what was your longest period that you didn't appear.

Because look, I mean, people know I'm a regular. You're a regular. You're a regular rotation and you have been ever since the beginning of the show. Look, there are a lot of regulars who have been on since the early parts of the show. Yeah.

And their appearances have dwindled to practically nothing. That's right. There are some who go through phases where they were on a lot certain years and then they'll take some breaks, then they'll come back up. Nick Kroll is maybe one of those who lately has just been available and around and loves being on the show and has had a little more time. It's usually whomever has a little more time on their hands.

But Paul, you always make it a priority to be here, especially at the end of the year.

It's very true, Scott. That being said, you missed a month.

So I don't know what happened there.

I don't know. I don't know. It's a little weird, a little weird. What we're doing on this show is we're counting down the episodes that you, the listeners voted on. The eligibility period is Thanksgiving of 2016 through Thanksgiving of 2017. And we put up a poll and you guys vote on it.

That's what happened. That's what happened. Look it up in your history books.

What do you buy down there? What do you got? Some sugar-free chocolate, the Chef Kevin.

What do they put in it to make it sweet if it doesn't have sugar in it?

I think they put sugar in it. They just say it's just say it to those fucking liars.

Chef Kevin gave you that. Yeah. It's like a Whitman sampler box.

It's a Whitman sampler. I thought it was just a regular old Whitman sampler. I didn't realize until I unwrapped it. It was sugar-free. And I think it's a gag. I think it's a person.

Some sort of gag that he's doing. By the way, every episode of Comedy Bang Bang has someone chewing into a microphone. And if you can spot it, then, and you do it every single episode and you send those results to me, you can win $1 million. So, and this is very exciting. I have to have proof, though. Yeah, you got to show receipts. Much like Beyonce.

Oh, no. Who am I thinking of?

Oh, yeah. Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian.

You got to show receipts like Judge Judy did. You ever watch Judge Judy? Oh, the dog. We did first came out. I have this friend.

You probably know her. Greg Griffin, aka Gray Delisle. She's had several names over the years.

She's not done yet either. She started out as Aaron Van Ozzbree when I first met her. And then gradually has metamorphosized into Greg Griffin. She does a lot of voices on your favorite animated programs. I believe she's Velma on Scooby-Doo, maybe. Joints.

Several other, she's always, she's like a regular, she's her and Tom Canier, the most into band VO artist. I've known her a long time since college. She's a very adorable baby who's like a little fat. So, she's very precious. Yes. Just got a Christmas card from her yesterday and all filled with images of that baby. Yes, that baby is very cute. Why did I bring her up?

Where was I headed with that?

My receipts. Judge Judy. Judge Judy. Yes. Okay, so. She liked Judge Judy so much that she went to the audience. And so, there are several episodes of her in the front row, like making faces and like reacting to what's going on. Like she can't believe it.

That actually sounds like fun.

I wonder if she still has. You know what? It sounds like fun until you realize those shows are probably taped like 12 a day. Yeah. And you have to sit there for probably like, aren't you always upset when all the Judge Judy episodes that day are done?

Don't you wish you had like 12? I know. I know. Because they run them 12 a day.

They run them 12 a day. Judge Judy, how old is she? How old is a woman is she? It seems like she started as 80. She seems, I mean, she's kind of ageless.

She's remained this look. She looks the same. Yeah. She did. She had work done. Unless they're just showing old episodes. I haven't really been tracking the show. Do you think Judge Judy has any sort of vanity about her? Does she have? Does she like it'll sometimes surprise me the people that, look, let's be honest, people it's obvious when people have worked on unless it's not. And we're just like, there's that some people are so good at, but you would think the richest people in the world, like Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, they'd have the kind that you couldn't be able to tell, but we can tell about them, right? I don't think Tom. Do you think Tom Cruise said we're done?

Yeah. Oh, honey. Grow up. But I wonder if she has any kind of vanity about her or she's just like, fuck it. This is the way I am. I think she values truth above all, because she will often say, truth in appearance, truth in appearance. She will often say, don't piss on my leg and tell me that it's raining. When do you think that the first time that happened to her?

Man, I think that young girl and someone was like, hey, check it out. I think there is probably a guy thought he could get away with it. And he started, hey, shut up. It's just raining.

He started pissing us. No, hold on. Here's what I think the scenario is. Why don't you play the role of Judge Judy? Okay. And you're standing there. You're waiting for a bus, let's say. You're a young gal. Is my bailiff on this bus? No, no, this is before you're a judge. You're on your way to law schools matter. My first day? That's your first day of law school. Oh, I can't wait to go to law school.

Waiting for the bus. That's exactly what you sound like.

And then there's a man next to you, play by me. Okay. And do I know this man or is this a complete stranger? You just complete stranger, but you don't even see me. Stranger danger. You're not aware of me yet. Are you a ghost? Are you invisible? No, I'm just being unobtrusive. You're in a periphery, but my... But here's how I get your attention. Okay, got it. You feel something, a stream of liquid hitting your leg, your bare leg.

Just my leg. Yes. And I'm wearing a mini skirt to go to law school for the first day? Not a mini skirt. So, but not maybe a pencil skirt or some sort? Yeah, sure. Okay. Call it that. All right.

I like to get it. Not a maxi skirt. Not a maxi. No, it's not like a bridal gown either. It's not enough. It's not you're not wearing a bridal gown to take the bus to your first day of law school.

What if I thought that that was what appropriate for the first day of law school? Like, I don't know.

I don't know. Better wear a bridal gown just in case. I would think you wouldn't last long at law school. Probably not. That's out for you. Although if you could argue about why you were...

Well, then head of class. So, starting out. Word has been...

Oh boy. Music by Timbuk 3.

So, you feel this stream of warm water on your leg. Yes, warm water on the leg. You turn and you smell the smell of urine one would presume. Sure. And I've had a spare. So, you turn, you see me urinating on your leg. Right. Penis out. Penis out. Flying proud. Yeah. At half-massed, perhaps.

Now, you turn to me. What is your reaction at first? My reaction is probably, hey, dude.

Hey, dude. Stop peeing on my leg. And I say, oh, it's raining.

Okay. All right. I'll give you that. You believe me. I believe you. You a young judge Judy. Believe me. Yeah. I believe you. Law student Judy. I believe you. Yeah. Sure. Why not? Yeah.

It's raining. It's raining. Okay. I guess. You've seen the evidence of your eyes.

I mean, I guess when I think about rain, it usually doesn't rain on your legs first. It's usually the head. No. That's very true. That's a tip off. It's an absolute tip off. By the way, with that title, don't pee on my leg. Why is she... That's a title. Normally a book. That's her book as well.

That's a title of her book. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm not fucking kidding you.

Is that true? End your hair, Cody Ryan. Could you please look up Judge Judy?

Judge Judy's book. Judge Judy P.

And just whatever comes up, we'll watch. In a church.

But no, do you think that it was softened to be like instead of a human man peeing on a head, doesn't it make more sense that it would be head if it was raining? I don't know. Or was she changing into a dog like a dog pees on fire plugs and legs?

And you think she was changing into a dog?

She's transforming into a dog. Like the Shaggy DA? Is Judge Judy...

Like a Shaggy DA situation where... Is Judge Judy under a curse?

Not a Chinese curse. Not a Chinese curse. But a Shaggy DA style curse. Yes. Where she changes into a dog sometimes in the middle of court. Can you look that up, engineer Cody Ryan?

Is Judge Judy a Shaggy DA curse? And whatever comes up, we'll watch. Whatever happens to come up.

Whatever. What? Whatever it is. So I think you have a pretty good idea of what the show is from this, right? Yeah, you should. You should. If you're still listening.

Okay, so let's get to it. What we're doing today, we've been counting down the top 16 episodes of 2017. Today we're going to count, we're going to listen to 12, 11, then we're going to crack the top 10 and get 10 and 9. And that's very exciting. And I got to say, these are good four episodes we're going to be listening to here. So I'm very excited for you. Finally. I really enjoyed the last ones. And these are a good four. So I'm, I hope you're going to enjoy it. And we're going to be counting them down sequentially from the highest to lowest countdown style. Right? That's how it goes.

That's how it goes. That's how most countdowns go.

Right. And you're cutting around because you look up countdown style.

And we'll watch whatever comes up. If it's look, if it's an hour long program, well, whatever it happens to be. If it's an old episode of countdown with Keith Oleman, we will watch it. Well, no matter what, let's get to it. Let's get to your first episode on this countdown. And this is episode number 12. Number one, two. All right. All right.

Episode number 12. Okay. Now this is very interesting, Paul.

I believe it's very interesting. Go on.

Statistically, this is very interesting. This is episode previous to this. We had prefontaine, meaning pre 500 episodes. That's right. This is episode 521.

This in fact is so late. This is the last possible app that could have been that was included in our eligibility period. This is episode 521 from November 20th, right before Thanksgiving Monday before Thanksgiving. This is episode and episode called Bing Bong Goodbye.

Bing Bong. Goodbye. Bing Bong. Goodbye. Let me talk about who's on this episode. We have the return of John Hodgman. Sure. John Hodgman, who was in our episode number 15, appears again in the countdown with the second of his appearances in this calendar year. Only on the show twice this year and made both of both of them. Amazing. We also have Lauren Lapkis. This is her first appearance in the countdown as Todd. Todd is a character that is my nephew. I can't remember if she ever, if she came in and it was my nephew, Todd or I can't remember why. I think he was your nephew from the beginning. From the beginning. Okay. But I think it was a character that she did before bang bang. I can't really remember. She does Todd on her Netflix character special and has no relation to me. But we also have John Gabris as Geno. Oh, did you do Geno for this one?

He did Geno for this one. John Gabris is a wonderful improviser, great, funny guy. And he has with the exception of one live episode only done Geno on this show.

By the way, I saw on Reddit. Why are you there? I don't know. I don't like myself.

There was some discussion about that live episode where John did a different character.

Jeff, this was in England. This was, I believe was in Nottingham? No, this was not Nottingham. It was the other one that we did.

Leeds. Leeds probably. I believe it was Leeds.

So he did a character which really, and he told us beforehand. I believe he told us beforehand.

He believed we took him to England. Lauren had to drop out due to a medical emergency.

And so we took fan favorite John Gabris with us. But John does not do multiple characters.

And as he was going on the tour, he was like, are you expecting me to do a bunch of characters?

I was like, no, you can do Geno the whole time or do whatever you want. And so he, on one episode, decided he wanted to do a totally different character. Yeah, except it was going to be Geno disguised as a different character. I don't know that I knew that. I can't.

I don't think that we talked about it. I can't remember if he told us beforehand, but then as he's doing it, he is dropping hints that he's Geno. Okay. There was, there was a discussion on Reddit was that you and I didn't like the character he was doing. And so we essentially shamed him out of doing it. No, over the during the course of the show.

Oh, it was great. It was funny. I remember that not being disappointed, but thinking that that character could have been that character the whole show. It was really funny. It was hilarious.

Yeah. Right. Yeah. Anyway, John, John primarily on this show does Geno and almost exclusively.

But Geno is such a funny, fun character and audience favorite. This is, we don't know if he'll appear in the countdown later, but he certainly after, I will say after a few years, he would, where he was consistently doing good work on episodes that were not voted in. It's a pleasure to see him on the countdown this year. That's right. We also have Darcy Carden, who people will know from the good place, currently where she plays Janet, fan favorite character there. She is on this episode playing the reprise of her character, Caroline Belinda Carlisle, who I think is a teacher. Although that doesn't, the teaching doesn't seem to come up all that much because we get very off track. Now, this is interesting because this episode, people, I remember when it came out, people were like, wow, this was like one of the best episodes this year, but it probably won't end up at the countdown because it's too recent.

And I will say it was not even in contention for maybe the first half of voting. It was maybe around 20 or so. And this episode had a very late surge of a lot of people voting for it, shooting it all the way up to episode 12 and deservedly so.

I think this is a really fun episode.

So let's get to it. This is Bing Bong Goodbye episode 521 from November 20th. This is your episode 12.

Number 12. I have the two of you met before, by the way, John and Gina and I have worked together before when I'm in town.

Yes. I normally have a professional valet. Yes. Or a squire. And a squire. And the squire. And the guy downstairs almost fucked me.

He tucked a little valet tick right in the horses bottle. I was like, no, no, no. I know it has no wipers, but this you cannot do this. I was like, and why was that your first instinct? And you're so casual. And don't you think the eyebrows are the wipers of a horse?

Yeah. How big are brows on Clydesdale's? I couldn't really take notice. They have big, big, bushy eyebrows. They're really good. They're really good.

They're like, they're like, they're like Joe Marks. They're the glasses. They're the owls of the equine world.

Folks, my name is John Hodgman. You think you know me, but you don't. I don't write a Clydesdale.

What? I'm a regular. That was a joke. Oh, fuck. There's an epilogue to this where you say you don't write a Clydesdale. I'm a regular human being. Oh, that horse is dead. I'm just the...

Oh, shit. That wasn't a Clydesdale. Yeah. Oh, no. I've been fucking jamming oats down this things going to let the whole... What the fuck was that that you rode in on? He was a Vespa. Oh, shit. You've been jamming oats down that thing might not run. Oh, no.

Company Bambang, we're back here with our intern, Geno, of course, and John Hodgman of television fame. Have you ever been in a movie? I have been in a movie. Which one? Like one of those Guardians of the Galaxy things? Baby Mama. Oh, not Baby Driver. No, it was the prequel.

Was that you and Baby Driver? They're wiping out, they're CGIing me and instead of...

They should. Yes. Just take Kevin Spacey out of any movie and then put John Hodgman in.

You're also one of the guys in Eyes Wide Shut that's just blocking some nudity, right?

Yeah, I'm the nudity blocker in almost all Delta airplane versions of R-rated movies.

You're just CGI-sipping tea and... Exactly. Blackboard status. Diamond, thank God.

Oh, excuse me. 2000 to Diamond. 2000 to Diamond. There should be a Neil Diamond song.

Hey, sorry. Keep it down, please. Keep it down, please.

Keep it down. No. Shut up. I'm doing a show.

I need help with my homework. I can't help you with your homework. What do you even study?

I'm studying the Mayflower and shit. I don't know anything about the fucking Mayflower.

I have to write a whole paper on how America was made.

Write it. I don't give a shit.

You're the one who's supposed to teach me everything. You're my father figure.

What about your teacher figure? That's the person who's supposed to teach you everything.

I'm supposed to come in with a floorboard. I'm gonna get in big trouble.

Well, you should listen in class, young man. Shut up. Let's make sure we leave all this in.

I'm sorry, guys. This is my nephew Todd. He's staying with me.

Todd, I haven't seen you in a hot minute. How are you?

You know, I'm sorry. I have to do it. How my uncle says hello, Mr. Sir. How are you?

Nice to see you. May I kiss your rings? Thank you, Todd. No, because it's a toe ring. I wouldn't recommend kissing it. Ugh. Nasty. I'm my fingers are too thin. I could hold on to regular rings, even the smallest child size. Yeah, I was. I have a Claire's girls belly button ring on my big toe right now. Oh my gosh. You got that a Claire's. I have a friend who works with Claire's. You do?

Yeah, my friend Tracy. Yeah, he's friends with a teenager.

He's a little freak and he won't even tell us me though. He has a teenage girls all the time.

Shut up, Todd. You're awake. You are disrespectful. Well, can you tell me one fact about America and the Mayflower and pilgrims and Indians? Just so I can have something to start my paper with. I know that we didn't land on Plymouth Rock, but Plymouth Rock landed on us. Yeah, can you incorporate that somehow?

Somehow. Does it make sense? A rock landed on us? Yeah, I think it's metaphorical.

They had buckles on their baseball hats. All right, I'm putting that in. They like to cinch them up real tight. Fine, I'm putting that in. Hey, mister, excuse me, sir. Yeah. Hi, nice to meet you, sir. Me and kiss your ring. That would be inappropriate. My uncle said I have to do it to every man I meet. Well, I don't want to have my face erased from every movie, so please stay over there. Okay, whatever. It's already been erased from all the one. It's true.

Well, wait, I was also in pitch perfect too. Oh, sorry, that's right. I think they're going to see GMI in for. See GMI. They're going to see G. I. Me, I in. Just my eye just blinking on Elizabeth anxious for right in pitch. Are you Irish? That's right.

They're going to see GMI and do every movie.

I'm the CG me. I'm not I'm not Irish, but I am from New England. So I do know quite a bit about Massachusetts and yeah, John, this is my nephew Todd. Hi, my uncle blocks me in a closet every night.

Um, that's fine. That's something I need to report. He makes me discipline. He makes me sleep standing up in the closet and then I said, reward, I get to sleep in the tub. Oh, a reward for what?

For being good for a week. If you can sleep standing up, then you can sleep anywhere. It's, I'm training you. That's true. For what? What exactly? Once he gets in the military. Okay, that's true. They aren't they aren't they do have him sleeping standing. It seems like the kind of sick fuck that should go right into the military. I don't want to go in the military. I'm sorry, but the minute you're 18. How old are you again, by the way?

Oh, middle school. Right. You can't jerk off a military. You in trouble. I'm sorry, but they put you in jerk off. Oh, you can jerk off in jail. JL JL sounds pretty good. I did eight hours in a drunk tank and they let me jack off like 15 times. Someone just like you. Well, you they made me jerk off 10 times and they let me do five more. Well, you would as a tip. Oh, well, you said W O U. I almost came on him.

Stone count. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

No, no, no. I'm sorry. No, no, no.

No, no, no. I was came, but then it stopped. Oh, that's the worst. You got to get that one out.

That'll go top. You haven't gone through puberty yet. Squeeze.

Yep. Just pull it out like toothpaste.

Do you still have, uh, I don't, John, I don't know. I'm officially distancing myself from this entire conversation. I don't know if you know this about Todd, but no, I don't know. Todd, Todd wished himself big. Oh, yeah. Well, uh, I want, I found a Zilter machine. I wish myself big.

And I got, um, I got big for a little bit, but then I got back to small. My dicks did big.

Oh, no, really? Yeah. It's pretty lucky, I guess. So, yeah.

So you're aging into your own penis. Yeah. Yeah. Every day a little bit older other than that penis. Right. Yeah. Does your penis also age? So you'll have an old man's penis when you're in your 20s. It's honestly wrinkled already. Well, no, it's got to get hard and then it, it smooths it. He's always trying to teach me this right now. It's wrinkled, but then it gets hard. He says, just give it a chance. He says, look at this video. He says, Todd, I'm going to make a quick call. No, no, John, I need you. I need you. I need you. You're saying you're from Massachusetts. I really feel like I need to call someone right now. She abandoned me. Yeah. My sister. Where is she? She just doesn't even care.

She was at the carnival one day. Yeah. Several years ago. I lost each other because I got big and she didn't recognize me even though I kept saying, Mom, you all means me. I'm just large now, and old. Wait, you never told me that that's what happened.

That's why you're stuck with me.

Yeah. I'm stuck with you. I mean, well, well, regardless, I'm not going anywhere. Yeah. Anyway, so she's off. Now, even though your private area is still that of a 35 year old man, how do you know a 35? Are you expecting me? I'm just saying that's just a statistically correct guess.

But now you look like a child and you can go back to your mom now. She would recognize you. No, she, yeah. Well, well, well, Scott, he claims that I'm being captured or being forced to stay with him, but he's captured me. He kept me there.

He really wants me there, I guess.

She left no forwarding contact info. Yeah. Well, I guess you just really love me so much is what it really is. Yeah. I mean, I love you. Like we all love our families at Thanksgiving, right?

I mean, that's coming up, right? How do you love them at Thanksgiving? You know, you're forced to be around him. Oh, come on. We've had great times on the movie nights. I would call this movie night. We want to be over and over again. It's a weird one.

Wait, what's his favorite movie?

Cacoon. What? He begs me to watch. I'm kind of the weirder for Cacoon too. And he'd never seen the first one.

I love those old people acting like the youngsters. He's here to use the opposite. Yeah. He gets up in front of the TV and dances around and acts out all the parts. That's right. I do the Wilford Brinley. Do the do the diving in the cannonball. Do the do the Donamichi breakdance right now. Oh, here we go.

Oh, wow. Oh, wow. You do have an Amici like quality to me.

Have you guys tried? Have you guys tried getting Todd's genitals into a cocoon type situation?

D. A. J.

Oh, right. And then a button. He wrapped it in toilet paper that was wet.

I did that because you were always taking them out and showing them to people.

Taking what out? You're your genitals. You're not supposed to.

Oh, yeah. You're Jenny's. We pluralize it. You know, as an adult.

Jenny's. Yeah. Whip out your jenny's. Whip out your 867-5309's.

That's what he says.

And then I have to sing 867-5309 while I wink it around. I just felt it hit that table leg.

Did the knowledge of that song come with your supernatural getting big?

I've never heard the song. Did you absorb all of the middle-aged culture that comes with being a weird dad? I've only heard it from him singing it. That's how he wakes up every morning.

Well, it's 8 o'clock and it reminds me of it. I wake up at 8 o'clock. That's too late.

That's too late. Paper. I'm gonna be in someone's trouble.

Yeah, John, what facts do you have? You're from Massachusetts.

So what are you studying? The Mayflower?

I gotta tell my teacher how America started. Just know.

Well, first of all, we didn't land at Plymouth Rock.

Oh, the rock landed on us. Wait a second.

That's when United States was started by a meteor strike.

What about all the Indians and pilgrims?

They were never. The pilgrims were the first ones here.

There were never any Native Americans here.

So who were the original Americans?

We killed them all. Wait, what?

I'm writing this all down with no context.

Here's what happened. A bunch of white people came, saw something that someone else had owned. They said, this is ours now.

We're big bullies.

Here's some blankets, smallpox. We're gonna form some states.

Let's get some slavery in here.

You could also use this exact essay for the, if your teacher ever asked you about rock and roll.

Yeah, exactly. And if they ever asked me about my life with Uncle Scott, he kidnapped me, stole my land.

He gave you smallpox blankets.

We're at me a smallpox blanket.

You have to help in New Manhattan for $32.

Missouri wanted to come in as a slave state.

So the guys running it were like, we don't want to expand slavery, because slavery is a human crime.

So what we'll do to make it morally acceptable is we'll admit a free state as well.

Yeah, they had a lot of good ideas.

That's how Maine became a state. After that, it's all new heart and shit.

Can you just write my paper for me? You wrote a book.

Yeah, do you mind writing the, yeah.

I thought you were writing all that down on the dry erase board.

Of course I was, but you didn't erase John's other book.

All right, here's what you want to do.

Oh shit, I did.

What was your other book idea? Do you remember?

It was all about becoming Diamond Delta medallion.

I mean, Delta Diamond medallion.

D-D-M-G-M-A.

C-G-M-A.

I have a cargo card for flying.

They put me in the bottom with all the puppies.

Well, it's cheaper.

I'm sorry.

Let's try to go dukie and it puppy cage.

Yeah, well, you know, I'm sorry that you had to be in there with that.

Yeah, that's just cheaper.

I don't have the money to buy you a plane ticket.

Where did it even go?

You never let me be unblindful to do it on your whole trip.

Well, you know, it's not a blindfold.

It's that doggy costume that I make you wear.

Yeah.

So we can get you down there.

You got to get tied registered as a service animal because then you can find the money.

I was going to send it to the set.

Exactly.

Just go online, get a phony psychiatrist.

To be universal life church.

That's right.

We went somewhere warm and you were sitting by water.

I could hear it moving and you had me at your feet the whole time.

And you kept saying more mocha lattes, please, and how these people fanning you.

That's what I like to drink on vacation.

He's mocha lattes.

Nothing like getting out in the sun by the pool and smashing down some chocolate lattes.

He's just diarrhea.

Diarrhea juice.

He likes to know what it's going to look like coming out.

So we only eat stuff that looks the same as poop.

I don't have another bowl of peanut butter and chocolate pudding stirred up.

Well, I don't know how you guys should.

The land of ivory.

Oprah once said a good poop looks like a brown banana.

She also said people fart 14 times a day.

I don't know what she's talking about half the time.

Seriously.

I'll get all my 14 out first thing in the morning.

That's my move.

Yeah.

Yeah, then you're not bothered for the rest of the time.

You don't have to worry about farting on the plane train or automobile.

I like to take my time with it and use it when I feel like it's punctuate.

Oh, that was clutch.

You had that in your ass to then my microphone fast.

What number is that for you today?

Top just completely spun like the hour on the hot smits.

It's been around the other axes.

Doing a Dennis Miller spin, but the other way around.

It's almost like Superman trying to turn back time.

I am out of here.

If I could turn back time.

Another one.

That's in huskop falls asleep.

I'll let him remember what I did the night before.

Shared down Jenny up, baby.

Look, help her out with this while we get to our next guest.

Oh, uh, him.

You're such I like to emasculate you.

It's not fair.

Look at this.

Holy shit.

No, that's well over 35 years old.

It's heavy.

Good God.

Yeah, it's heavy.

It's mostly balls.

That's the whole I am.

You got to be 50 to 60 possibly a gym teacher.

It gets heavier.

It's good older, right?

Oh, it gets way heavier.

They say lead accumulates and you scrotum to protect you from radiation, but it also has side effects of being pretty heavy because lead's one of the densest materials.

But Superman can't see through it.

So right.

Choose ideal.

Very protect your sperm from Superman's eyes.

Right.

Because you can count them from a distance and that's the last thing you want.

From a distance.

That's what God takes.

Thanks, lunch.

From a distance.

I like to keep my lunch on the other end of the table.

As he watches the postmates track delivery.

What?

God is watching.

God.

Stop seeing.

God is watching.

God.

Shut the fuck up.

From a distance.

We got to get to our next guest.

Sorry.

Are you going to be a good little boy?

Yeah, daddy.

Okay.

We need to get to our next guest.

This is very exciting and we don't often get a guest of this caliber.

All right.

I know we have John Hodgman on.

He's an author.

Been in two movies, but this is exciting.

Okay.

All right.

Be on your best behavior, please.

I'm putting on my bow tie.

Okay.

Thank you so much.

All right.

I was also in movie 43.

I played the penguin.

Oh, I think I think just let's not let you stay.

We'll leave that part out.

No, you don't.

I shouldn't shouldn't be on my IMDB page.

Don't you want to bring it up?

Well, wait.

You know, because you know, my wife's joining me on the book tour and I'm going to have her introduce me tomorrow.

So I was going to have her say that from movie 43.

Well, that's the only.

You know, you only know him from movie 40.

Yeah, that's right.

That's what she knows you.

That's how we met, actually.

She was crashed services on one to it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It was at the premiere of movie 43 and she was the other person there.

So we quickly fell in love and became married.

A little good me cute.

Mm hmm.

That's right.

And you me.

Me cute.

Yeah.

Oh, well, don't speak.

You can't say yeah.

Don't speak.

Is that what you're doing?

Don't speak.

I know.

Just watch your thing.

That's why it's saying what I put you to bed.

All right.

Let's get to our next guest.

Thinking.

Good night.

He's terrifying.

I don't want him to jerk off.

Like he's in the army.

Army rules.

No jerk.

Army rules at my house.

Sleep standing up.

No.

I keep doing it in secret.

It's getting bad.

Where have you been doing it?

I can't say.

You'll get punished.

I'll get punished.

Uh huh.

By whom?

The neighbors?

Yeah, how can I do it in their cars?

Oh, god.

You're breaking into our neighbor's car.

No, I'm just doing in the gas tank.

Okay.

See you how far it can run.

You didn't do it in the Vespa downstairs, did you?

Uh, that Clys do?

Was there a lot of oatmeal in whatever your jerk could off maybe?

Hey, eyebrows.

Oatmeal.

Yep.

That's about right.

We're handlebars.

Who baby?

What baby?

What child is this?

Who baby is this?

Who baby?

Well, that was a fun clip.

I enjoyed that show.

That's uh, and very recent.

Normally the people, I mean, we've talked about it on the show.

Look, we've talked about this before.

People vote for the recent episodes a lot of times because they're fresher in the minds.

It's a mind.

But that said, when they're this fresh, people say, I don't have enough distance from it.

Maybe I shouldn't vote for it.

But I'm one.

I'm still feeling the effects of it.

Mm-hmm.

People loved it so much.

It's just from a month ago and it's number 12 on our countdowns.

I mean, that's crazy.

How long is the voting period?

About a month.

And good for John Hodgman.

Always great.

He's been on the show several times, but never been in our top, our countdown, I believe.

So it's great that he has two episodes.

He's made the worst ofs many times.

Yep.

This is the first time.

Just in friendship as well.

Oh, yeah.

Worst friend.

Yeah.

Of 2017.

When we do the Council of friends meeting, every year?

We all have to find our hoods.

And that, to me, since we're only doing it once a year, I'm always like, where did I put my hood on me?

I know.

Just put it in the closet with the winter coats.

I know, but it's easy for you to say.

It is.

But then I get it.

But then I toss it off the minute we get back from our Council of friends meeting, and then I don't remember where I put it.

Well, you got to...

It's like your play close versus your school close.

That's true.

Come home.

You pull your school from the play.

That's right.

I'm playing Hamlet.

That's right.

I put my pontoons away.

And you come home to get homeschooled.

Pontoons.

Is that something?

No.

What about me?

It is something.

But it's something you wear.

What am I thinking of?

I'm thinking of those like...

Pantaloons?

Yeah, I guess that's probably.

But what am I thinking of with the like, like flowy like bulbous...

The puffy shorts?

Yeah, the puffy shorts.

I think those are pantaloons.

Are those pantaloons?

Pantaloons?

Pantaloons.

Speaking of pantaloons, it's time.

Oh, I got nothing.

No, there's no way.

I quite often start a segue, and I can get it in the middle, but that one is tough.

You look at me here. That was a tough one. We can't speak in pantylons. We can't go along with this episode without taking a break. No. Okay, no. The reviews are in. We need to take a break. When we come back we'll have, oh, this is great. One of my favorite episodes of the year. When we come back we're going to have your episode number eleven after this.

Comedy bang bang. Comedy bang bang. Comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang. Comedy bang bang. No, it's not the beginning of the show. You got tricked you idiot. You dumb motherfucker. I hear you. Good Reggie. Watch impression though. You have to admit. Thank you.

No, I'm talking to myself and saying you have to admit. So welcome back to the countdown. We're counting down the top episodes of the year. Paul of Tomkins and I.

And we just heard from Bing Bong goodbye. The first episodes of Lauren Lapkus and John Gabers on the countdown.

And now we are going to go to a great episode. I was very excited to record this. This is your episode number eleven.

Number one. One. Number eleven. This one goes to eleven.

Yes. Thank you. Nigel St.

Nigel Tofnall. Tofnall. Is that what it was? Who's the given saint? David St. Hubbins. David St. Hubbins. What?

Stop talking about Gibbons all the time.

When do you think that I last saw Spinaltat by the way?

Would it surprise you to know probably about three weeks?

Two months ago. Oh, really? Is that true? Yes.

And I can't remember the names. I haven't seen anything.

Really? Really? It's a good one. Holds up. It's amazing.

Did I say number eleven? Yes, you did, man. Okay. So we got talking about Spinaltat? Okay. Okay. Okay. They fuck you at the drive-through. That's another movie I just watched.

Why did you watch that? Two separate projects. I watched Spinaltat for one project and I watched Lethal Weapon 2 for another.

Wow.

This is an episode that I was very excited to record. This is episode 514 from October 16, a month before the last episode that we just heard a clip from.

This is an episode called the Calvin's Twins Return. Oh, sure. Now three and a half years ago... Can you imagine?

Can you even imagine a world where it was three and a half years ago?

I don't even... I mean, there are babies who are younger than this episode. We're three and a half years in the future now.

There are babies who have babies younger than this episode.

There are grandchildren being born every day.

Now you may be wondering why, and please give us a grandson.

Please.

Will they kill you to give us one grandson? They're gonna give us a grandson. Make it a masculine child.

You may wonder, hey, this is the best of 2017. Why are you bringing up three and a half years ago? Well, three and a half years ago, we recorded, in my opinion, a classic comedy bang bang episode.

I believe it was episode 150 or something. I mean, it's like very early.

That's very early.

And this was Taren Killam, whom people will know from Saturday Night Live, had a four year tenure, I believe, on that show.

And Paul Britton, whom people may also remember from Saturday Night Live, had about a year on that show.

They... I don't know whether they were friends before SNL, but they certainly are great friends now, and they love to improvise together.

And three and a half years ago, they did an episode called the Calvin's Twins, and the story behind that episode was we didn't know anything about what they were gonna do.

They didn't... They hadn't talked about it previous to the episode. And prior to the episode, they looked at each other and said, what do you want to do?

And I believe it was Taren who said, maybe we could do people who own horses?

I think maybe that was the extent of it. Maybe even people who are horse promoters. Maybe they have that much.

I don't even know that they have that much.

The episode that they did was one of the more insane episodes that we have ever done.

The improvising details. I think I've talked about this before, but when they did those characters on the Comedy Bang Bang television show, I asked our writers assistant, Caroline Anderson, if she could listen to the episode and type out the plot because we couldn't remember all of the details.

And it's one of the most insane documents I've ever received, this email, which had all of the Calvin's Twins details of everything about their business.

But they are promoters of horse fighting. They own horses that do horse boxing matches to the death.

And they have presided over thousands, tens of thousands of horse deaths over their career.

And they have a place that they do these horse deaths, these horse fights, the Calvin's Twins, Bee Honey horse farm, I believe.

And all of this was improvised. They had not talked about any of it as much of this show is.

We normally don't talk a lot about what we're going to do on the show. Everything is improvised.

And this was one of the more fun episodes that we've done.

Now they...

Hold on a second. What you were describing was the first time that...

That was the first one, three and a half years ago.

Yes. So you were playing the same characters coming back.

One would think that it was so popular we would do at least one a year or something.

But for some reason we've never done a sequel to it.

Taren had a film coming out this last October.

Killing Gunther. Killing Gunther.

And so I asked him, hey, do you want to do an episode? And what if we did a sequel to this?

And it was as easy as just asking them. They said yes. And Taren said, hey, could we also have Ryan Goll, who we all heard.

And then we could have Ryan Goll being a rival horse promoter.

So that was all that we talked about before the episode.

And it again became one of the crazier episodes that we've ever done.

So let's hear... This is just a clip of it. I recommend you go back and listen to the entire episode because it's a delight the entire time.

This is your episode number 11. This is the Calvin's Twins Return.

Number 1. Welcome back to the show, guys.

Thank you for having a pleasure to be here.

I'm feeling tickled, pickled, rut-rickled, and jacked, and mcknickel.

Oh! I didn't see that one, comin'.

So you feel done, rickled as well as jacked?

Well, I'm jabbering and gibbering and burning and zinging and zapping and then before we get to all that, I brought ya a fresh, fresh jug of Calvin Twins beef farm horse fighting field, honey.

Oh, my God. Oh, yeah.

Put that on your toast.

That is heavy. My goodness.

You put that right there on your toast.

That's a five-gallon jug of honey.

Is this a lifetime supply, would you say?

That sounds like a sad lifetime.

If you only go through five gallons...

You better be scooping hand-forth by the end of this episode.

Oh, yeah. I apologize.

Drink it down. Coat the throat.

Okay, certainly. I have been known to get a touch of laryngeitis here and there, so I appreciate this.

Oh, that'll take care of it.

You using your pipes for a living.

I guess exactly.

Talkin' on this podcast.

And I use my pipes at home as well whenever I take big shit, so that's...

Can I pour it down there?

Will it help with that?

Please put it in your bottom, yeah.

It decogs, drags, flip-flogs, sits on logs, hops round frogs.

This honey will take care of everything.

It's interesting.

On purpose.

Yes, it's interesting that frogs sit on logs.

I mean, that's very convenient.

It's true. It's like humans should sit on boom-age.

Yeah.

If you like a soft-rass.

Do-let.

So, guys, welcome back to the show.

I mean, I...

It's such a pleasure to be here.

I have not seen neither hide nor hair of you, and that's a horse term.

Yes!

Well done.

Yeah, we've been back in the saddle.

You know how busy we are, uh, uh, promoting fights.

Certainly.

Attending birds.

Yes.

Burying horses.

That's right.

Last time you were on the show.

Getting horses out of the dead horse freezer.

Because we were back long.

Yeah, I mean, it's gotten so complicated because now there's a thawing process.

Oh, right.

Before we would dig, we would bury the horses straight out the freezer.

Right.

And they were freezing the ground.

They were killing the crops.

Oh, I see.

The crops were getting frozen from underneath.

I see.

Due to the just giant block of frozen dead horse.

Yeah.

Frozen blood, hit horse blood.

Yeah, let me seep into the manure.

Let me explain exactly what these guys do.

Chico hands and, and, and, Bever Hopox.

That's me.

And you're known as the Calvin's twins.

That's right.

You guys are twins.

My brother from another mother from the same parents.

Same father and mother.

Born at the same time.

Yeah.

Correct.

Right.

Okay.

Shoulder the shoulder.

Shoulder the shoulder right out of mama.

We came out side wise.

Like a, like a red rover.

Yeah.

How did you guys fit?

Let's just say our manners came late to us.

Because day one, it was me first, me first, me first.

And we just muscled and shouldered our way out of that lady hole.

That track came out the same time.

We do everything together.

Yeah.

That must have been very painful for your mother.

Oh, she's a plane.

No, wait.

She could blame.

Kill her spirit.

Kill the spirit.

And it's like.

And what about her body?

Her body stayed around.

She passed away sadly during one of our most famous horse.

Oh, that's right.

You talked about this last time.

As your famous liver member.

I'm a Gregor Mayweather of fights, if you will.

Right.

It was Randy the horse, as I recall.

Yes.

She was trying to protect him.

That was your favorite horse.

And that was the Muhammad Ali of horses, as I recall.

He is.

He's still around.

Randy the horse is still around.

Well, he still got that title.

Oh, OK.

The Muhammad Ali of horses.

I didn't realize that was an actual title.

It is a title.

Yes.

OK.

Wow.

That's how we branded him.

Muhammad Ali was the Randy the horse of guys.

Just guys.

Not even boxing.

No.

Just fellas.

Just good guys.

Just in terms of his demeanor.

So guys, you, of course, these are fights to the death.

And that's why there are so many horse deaths on your conscious.

Consciences.

And so many burials and a big backup of these.

And now there's a thawing process.

You get them at room things down room temperature.

Do you try to get them hot like a steak or?

It's a seasonal thing.

You know, you can get a bit cooler corpse in the winter time, but, you know, that, that, that corpse is going to heat right up in the summer.

In the summertime.

So you don't have to worry about it.

But what did you say?

It's about.

I was wondering if you, if, when you thaw them, do you try, is it like a microwave process where you're just trying to get them room temp or?

Well, we tried to ground temp.

Yeah, we did try to construct a horse microwave big enough.

That's true.

And you know I'm a tinkerer.

A choker, of course.

Do you know how to make an actual microwave, let alone a horse sized one?

I read a book and I took a part at old microwave.

Yeah, fabulous job.

Which book was this, by the way?

I, I book about making microwaves.

Mm hmm.

And what was it?

Do you remember the title of it though?

Oh, gosh.

Microwaver, make a microwave.

No, that was right.

It was about how to make popcorn.

And so it didn't help me one bit.

Hey.

And I'm stuck with all these parts.

Oh, the book on that.

Yep.

I'm stuck with all these parts and these screws and I put it together.

It looked kind of like a microwave.

But it didn't do anything.

Sure.

Have the shape.

Right.

You got the boxpot.

Yeah.

It was a rectangle.

I would think that would be the easy part of making a microwave.

You're sick.

Well, the shape of it.

Well, I...

You'd be right.

I am fine.

It was very simple.

I implore you.

Have that.

If it sounds so simple, please have that.

And chip us a horse microwave because we could use one.

I'm not saying that I could do the other parts of it.

Oh.

The basic shape.

It seems like that's step one.

All right.

Yeah.

So I did the easy part.

Yeah.

All right, I get that.

I'm making a moveable door.

That would be slightly harder than making a...

Yes, I did that too.

You did that as well.

It would have a hinge.

Okay.

And then...

Bego, yeah.

Did you lead horses in?

I mean, you can't do that to water, but can you lead them into a horse shaped microwave?

That's a clever...

That's a clever phrase.

You can't make them zap.

That's right.

You can lead a horse to an over-saupthed microwave, but you can't make them zap.

You can't make them zap.

You can't nuke them.

Especially if it's not functional.

Yeah.

So you can't make them zap because the buttons are on the outside.

Yeah.

So you lead a horse to a microwave and over-sized microwave.

You can't make them zap.

They're inside the microwave.

That's right.

Also, you forgot the part where we weren't trying to cook live horses.

Yeah.

We were just reheating, thawing, frozen dead horses.

Well, I did forget that.

Yeah, it's a bit that hard.

Yeah, we're not monsters over here.

Have you ever thought about making a giant microwave oversized microwave with buttons on the inside, so people could go in there and cook themselves?

Oh.

People, horses, whatever you want.

Wow.

Yo.

Like that might be if there were ever a horse who wanted to forfeit a match instead of being killed.

You could say you can forfeit, but you'll have to go inside.

You'll have to go in.

And you enter for digit code.

Right.

Make your piece with four scott.

Like 69.

69.

That's a good one.

You get in there and zap yourself.

Yeah.

I've never, I didn't bring this up there.

You guys are very short.

You guys are, how tall are you?

You're about four foot nine in lifts.

That's right.

Yeah.

And how, how big are the lifts?

Well, look, look at them.

Oh my.

Those are giant.

Yeah.

So you guys are about half a jockey apiece.

Yeah.

I was a jockey myself.

That's that, that was, I did, I performed in one race.

Mm hmm.

The horse.

Let me down.

I swear it.

I swear I'll kill you.

Yeah.

Wait.

So this is all been a revenge play?

In some ways.

No, that was just the racing horse.

Okay.

But it was the spark of an idea.

It was the spark, the spark to the flame.

Yeah.

You guys are so short in fact that you would have to get on each other's shoulders and put like a mini trench coat around each other just like, audition for the movie Willow.

We did.

Really?

Yeah.

You did?

Oh yeah.

I don't know why I thought of that.

Were you, were you, were you spying on us?

It was not a big, big party.

It was for vodka.

The warrior.

I don't know if you remember.

I don't remember.

Nate, they went ethnic.

I saw it opening night and then I've never seen it again.

Got it.

Yeah.

Vodka.

Well, you know, there weren't a ton of lines, but there was a great scene at the crossroads.

Oh, right.

When, when Matt Baudigan introduces himself and he's in the cage at the crossroads.

Okay.

Right.

And very, very, very tender scene where Willow and his best friend decide to stay behind and take care of the dakini baby.

Oh, I see.

So who would have gotten to perform the head parts of those scenes?

Chico.

Chico would have done it.

Yes.

You know, you seem to know so much about it.

Yeah.

I'm familiar with the movie in time.

I was the one who was off book, you know, reading, reading, reading.

You were whispering.

Yes.

You would say the lines right up my pooper.

Essentially, because that's where I went.

Willow, if you want, we'll stay behind.

One wonders why you didn't just switch if you knew the lines is because.

Camera shot.

Oh, okay.

And I got done.

I get all toned time.

I get all bashful.

All fumble jambly.

Start getting flushed like a bleed horse.

Like a blushing.

Or a one two combo punch to the horse mouth.

Oh, my gosh.

Well, well, this is fascinating, guys.

I mean, I got to go visit your stadium at somebody.

Are there luxury boxes?

Yes, there are.

We spent a billion dollars on luxury boxes.

Anyone ever sit in them?

Not one time.

Do you have to like stock up the food on the?

We haven't even had it.

There's been no need, really.

Yeah, I hope that fridge is still, that mini fridge is still working.

I don't know.

We haven't checked on it.

Why has it been a billion dollars and then only make a mini fridge?

Get a regular one.

Yeah.

No, you make some good boy.

Is this just because of you guys' stature?

We have a problem.

Yeah.

Maybe we would do it.

Yeah.

So to you, like mini-me is just me.

We call him me.

Right.

Verntroyer.

Is it?

Yeah.

So guys, it's confusing.

It's very confusing.

So if you're ever like, no, me.

You're talking about Verntroyer.

Always.

Okay, great.

Okay.

I'll keep that in mind for the rest of the episode.

For referring to ourselves, we always say, ah.

Okay.

But me and hand-a-that cookie.

Yeah.

So when you went to see the film Me, Myself and Irene.

Oh, we were very disappointed.

And disappointed.

We were so.

We were confused.

The ticket taker was baffled.

Right.

Because then you have Jim Carrey, who's one of the taller movie stars.

Yes.

Yeah.

He's a lanky fellow.

Yeah.

And there's no fun.

And then there was no us.

Right.

Yeah.

He expected to be in the film with Verntroyer.

That's right.

Yeah.

What about we did audition for it?

Actually, we did audition.

Yeah.

Did you get on top of each other?

Yes, we did.

We got a trench coat.

What are some of the audition lines that you used on that?

Were you off-book for that as well?

Certainly.

Yeah.

Well, we auditioned for the lead role.

That's right.

Really?

Of what was his name again?

Me?

Oh, right.

Yes.

So you were surprised.

You auditioned for it.

But when you saw it, you were surprised that Verntroyer did not get the role.

Oh, yeah.

You didn't make sense yet.

Again.

Yeah.

I get all caught up and the opportunity presents itself.

And I wasn't thinking straight, but.

I can imagine you left the audition just saying, well, I assume Verntroyer will get this role.

We've got it.

Do you audition a lot?

You've been on two auditions just in passing anecdotally.

Not as much as we used to.

Not too frequently.

Right.

Are you, how frequent is frequent?

Because I know you have your horse fights in the morning and in the evening.

Yeah, so we don't much get an opportunity.

We don't much have the time for it.

It's been a number of years actually since the audition.

Oh, right.

It sort of set time aside in the year.

Yeah.

A couple months around pilot season.

Okay.

Set up shop at the Oak Woods.

Don't go to department.

Right.

Did you, were you at the Oak Woods when they burned down Griffith Park?

Those kids set off the fireworks and burned down Griffith Park?

Yeah.

Those kids.

There's the kid.

Wait a minute.

Those kids.

I guess they just said they were kids because they were approximately three feet.

Yeah.

It's kids.

Only kids like fireworks.

We'll never know.

Okay.

This is very exciting because before the break we heard some amazing news which is that Bizbee St. Hancock himself has challenged the shameful boys here to a horse off.

When I take all.

I don't even know.

When I take the industry.

I don't know what this means.

But let's hear exactly what it means.

Because you guys have been, I have to say you turned as pale as a ghost or a white mous.

Mm hmm.

I guess.

You got, almost as if you were afraid of the very notion of a horse off.

Oh no, no, no.

We're not afraid of nothing.

We ain't afraid of a goddamn thing.

I think you're probably never heard language like this.

We ain't afraid of motherfucking nothing.

Chico.

Up in this piece.

Chico.

Please, please.

Can someone explain what a horse off is and what is the procedure for a horse off?

I think we can all do that.

Are you guys are going to do it in unison or?

That's right.

Or are you going to switch off sentences?

It doesn't make sense to switch off.

We should do it in unison.

We'll just going to do it at the same time.

A horse off is a competition between two or three horse fighting promoters.

When the industry is at risk because of hostile competition, each promoter will take three horses to church.

Church.

Have them baptized.

They hadn't.

Preak those horses to an open field at sunrise.

Now, don't forget about the sex.

The sex?

Sex.

But also don't forget about the sex.

Who's having sex?

Each of the promoters will bring one companion.

All female.

What?

So hopefully.

Female.

Okay.

You guys don't need to bring that.

It can be very, you know, let's not get into homophobic stuff in the rules of a horse off.

All right.

It's an old.

These are old.

These are old rules.

ended. Yes, they're a little bit less. Anyway, continue.

Now, as we were saying, one companion in the field will lie down under one horse for motor, for motor, okay, yeah, okay.

I feel like we're only halfway through this.

Oh, barely. Okay, we'll continue that. I don't need interrupt. The promoter and companion will consummate the event. Both must have reached climax before the bomb of the sun has pierced the horizon.

So both must have so you got to find someone who can have an orgasm on both sides. Male or female. Oh, but hopefully you guys don't need to reiterate it. If you disagree with it.

And basically it's sundown yet. It's sundown by the time so you get there at sunrise. Oh, with this ear control. They promoted and six horses sit inside for the remainder of the day. If anyone makes the sound, they lose.

Okay, let me see if I can get this right. It's very simple.

So you take two or three horse promoters. They then take a horse apiece to church where they baptize the horses. They take three horses. They take three horses.

Oh, three apiece. Okay, so with you three, it's nine horses.

Yes, you take them to church. Doesn't matter what type of church. Does it have to be a piss couple? Okay, a piss couple has to be a piss. Okay.

And they have to have, I guess, a tub or tank big enough for a hose is acceptable for a horse baptism. A hose is okay. We don't want to make this more complicated than it is.

Okay, so after the baptism around sun up, you guys go to an empty field. At sundown. At sundown up. At sunrise. At sunrise. So you have the full day. But you were about to say it's sundown. He calls himself a horse. I didn't even know the reason.

What I was trying to say. He doesn't even know. I said, no, I said that sundown would that be the wrong time. Okay, right. That would be the wrong time. He was bringing up what time would be the wrong time. I roll.

Thanks for that. This is an audio medium. So at sunrise, then one of the horse promoters, you all bring companions.

In one of the companions, ladies. Girls are possible.

So one of them lays underneath one of the promoters. They have to ejaculate before the sun goes down. And then you sit in silence with the horses. And if any of you speak, make a noise.

Including the horses. Including the horses you're disqualified. So and it's process of elimination. Meaning once one is done, it's hands on a hard body style. I don't know if you know anything about that. Bizbee.

Never heard of that. We auditioned for that. And then they told us it's a documentary. For the musical.

Let's hear some of the songs. I mean, my hand, my hand, my hand is on the truck. My hand down a hard body. Hot body gotta get my hand down a hot body.

But will my loved ones wait for me? Is this the best thing for me? Am I gonna win this car or lose my love?

Hamilton. And you didn't. Hamilton at the end of that song.

Very interesting. I feel like Baba could have gotten the job, but maybe Chico.

You're camera shy. You didn't get it? I'm too known. He's the real taste on screen. You both have just lovely singing voices.

Thank you. Yeah. So once one is eliminated, then the other two are in competition. And then once the second person is eliminated.

Actually giving them an advantage by letting them both do it. Yeah, because as long as you get out, then they probably don't care who wins.

I don't mean to speak for you. Do you care who wins? That's the problem with this challenge. Only one walks away with the business.

Right. And it's winner take all. When you say winner take all, what do you mean about it? You're an abomination.

You trying to drive a wedge between me and my dear great beloved best friend and brother. I would never.

It's not going to happen. Try a different strategy. Idiot.

Okay. Well, strong words from Chico hands.

AKA one of the shameful boys. No. Sorry. Sorry. You're not captain shameful though. I'm Joan Scalvin. Do you know who I am?

Well, you know what you're challenged. You have to take the challenge. You have to take the challenge.

The rule is the horse in industry. When you say winner takes all, what do you mean by take the money?

I mean, whoever loses will pack up and leave the horse industry forever.

Ah, and does so the winner then gets to take over in your case who would be a $7 billion. I'd get there. I'm assuming there's no debt.

Well, it's practically all debt actually. We're on a payment program. We've done an offer in compromise with the IRS.

This might be a good situation for you guys, by the way, to get out of a sticky situation.

I will never walk away from horse fight. Try. I'm never going to walk away. Okay. I'm just saying like like he's offered you a lifeline here like 50% of the horses who participate in the horse fight.

You're never going to walk away. Right. You'll end up in a horse microwave at some point. Gladly.

You can't push the buttons myself. 6969 right there. Well, I have one of those, by the way.

You do have a horse microwave. I built it myself. What? Wow.

That's possible. That's I did. I have it.

That's why I don't have to. I don't have the backup that you guys have. Another reason I could handle this industry more efficiently.

So when does this take place? I mean, and what field is it a field of both of your choosing or Christmas day?

Christmas day. Wow. Okay.

Christmas day field on October 31st. That's right.

Christmas day field on all Halloween.

All Halloween. Do you have to dress up for this in a costume? I probably will.

Appreciated. You don't have to. It'd be festive. But it's easier to go to your Halloween parties if you're dressed up.

Afterwards. Yeah. Previously. Are the losers really going to feel like going to Halloween parties afterwards?

There's no better way to. Lift your spirits up. Yeah. Lift your spirits up.

I'll literally. I'll literally. Well, so this is coming up.

Wow. This is incredible.

I still I still take Umbridge. Yeah. I figured. Umbridge is the name of one of our horses. Oh, really? So he's going to take Umbridge.

Sorry. Yeah. No, I was just taking Ross. Definitely take Umbridge.

I take offense. Okay. Wait, just offense so that the horses don't get away.

That's right. I'll take offense and I'll put it up. Well, I do appreciate the despite our differences.

I appreciate the consideration of the horses. I'm a gentleman.

Number one. One. Ah, yes. Very funny. That was Ryan Gaula's Bizbee St. Hancock.

Now, did these guys go back and re listen? I don't believe so. No. They as a matter of fact, none of us did, I believe.

And I actually forgot their catchphrase. You got to laugh.

Which is so important to the first episode because they're talking about how when you see that many horse deaths in your career, you got to laugh.

That can be your only reaction. You got to laugh. And that became their catchphrase. You got to laugh. So much so that we have t-shirts. We have Calvin's twins t-shirts in the store currently that are for their B Honey Horse Farm and their tagline is you got to laugh.

I hadn't listened to it. I forgot that. I normally would pimp someone into saying their catchphrase. I forgot it so much so that Taren said it as the very last line of the episode.

The whole episode went by without him saying it. And they are like, okay, thanks everyone. You got to go by. And he said, you got to laugh.

And we stopped and I said, I forgot. I've totally forgotten you got to laugh. We would have said it way more. That is of course Taren as Beaver Hopox and Paul as Chico Hands, the Calvin's twins.

And Ryan Gall as Bizbee St. Hancock. They were all in charge of their own names. In charge of their own names.

We need to take a break. When we come back, we're going to have one of the more classic comedy bang bang pairings. And we're going to crack the top 10. This is very exciting.

All right, let's come on back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Hey, welcome back to comedy bang bang. We're Paul and I were doing what we do every commercial break, which is saying, Sean, on us.

We sing, get a job in its entirety during every break.

Every break. And this one ended a little sooner than we expected. Sorry. Sorry about that.

Hey, you know what? Speaking of Sean on off, that brings us to our next episode on our countdown. We're cracking the top 10.

And I mentioned this is a classic comedy bang bang pairing.

This is it. I remember you saying that. And I mentioned Sean on. What could it possibly be? This is your episode 10.

All right, episode 10. This is episode 518, a mere four episodes after our previous episode. This is no from November 6th.

Again, very late in the serve. Very late in the year. Just a mere month and a half ago, or actually now at this point, almost two months.

This is an episode called corn dog, horn dog. And this is the classic comedy bang bang pairing of Jason Manzukas and Andy Daley.

There we go. And this was, you know, Jason loves to do the show.

He loves it. Is this the first Jason Manzukas episode that we've heard? Yes, it is.

The first appearance of Jason Manzukas on our countdown. He loves to do the show. He loves to do it with different people.

He quite often will text me and say, Hey, can I get an episode with Paul coming? That happened once.

More than once, my dear. I'm getting around. He'll say, Hey, I'd love to do an episode with such and such person.

But there's something about the me, Jason, Andy episodes that we've done quite a few of them.

We used to do them on the hundreds. We did them on episodes.

That's right.

200 and 300 and 400. That's right. And we tried to do it for episode 500. Couldn't do it.

And Andy was in Scotland doing the festival.

Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He was gone for a long time. We tried to squeeze it in. We couldn't get it done.

But Andy said, Hey, when I get back, I definitely want to do one. And Jason agreed to do it.

And it's always fun to do episodes with these two people.

We've been doing them since very early on in the run of comedy bang bang since the 70s or 80s.

I don't mean the 1970s or 1980s. You saw in my face that I was confused.

I saw in your face and I wanted to slap it.

Oh, I was just like, Oh, why? You deserve it. You fucking piece of shit.

How dare you.

Now, this episode, Andy sometimes throughout the early years of comedy bang bang, he would primarily come with a character that he had worked out on stage.

Yes. A lot. Yes.

So the Bill Carter trainer to the stars, the Danny Mahoney.

Danny Mahoney's all of these were ones that he had done live on stage quite frequently.

Yes.

At a certain point he ran out of those. And so he started doing new characters. And that's what we have on this episode.

This is someone that he had been thinking about doing ever since he had been in the previously aforementioned.

Do you have to say previously when you say aforementioned?

It's probably just aforementioned, right?

That's right.

That's like saying more unique, right?

You seem like all the light has gone out of your eyes.

This is, you know, when we get into the nuts and bolts, I just get bored.

You're not interested.

No, I'm back. I'm back.

You're back. All right. So he had been thinking of this character in the aforementioned Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

And this is him doing a Scottish accent. This is Andy playing Cameron McGonagall, who has a very interesting business that he does.

Oh, he's Scotland. So let's hear a little bit of it. This is your... Cracking the top 10. This is your episode 10.

Number 10.

You work in the tour. Do you work for a specific company?

No, I don't know. Yes. And I'm here to promote myself because I don't belong to the Jain, like Tourist company or anything like that.

I am an independent businessman. I've got my own small business.

Small business. That's right. How many employees do you have?

I've got it. It varies. But it's like I'm the only one that's always there.

And then I've got every one of us and people that helped me out and whatnot.

Sure. What I do is I'll give ghost chores a bit better.

Oh, wow.

Yeah, that's right. That's fun. That can be a lot of fun.

We have those here in the States as well.

Have you got ghost chores here?

We do. What do you know? You had them.

People, you go to places that are considered to be haunted.

Right.

Spooky ghost stories and sometimes the tour people tell stories about the beheadings and the lights.

Oh, that's brilliant. That's what we do as well.

Yeah. But our ghost chores, it's not places that are like, what did you say?

Supposed to be haunted. These places are haunted. I'm telling you, it's ghosts.

It's ghosts all over the city of Edna, but it's an old city.

It's fun. Yeah. Exactly.

No, I'm telling you that it's ghosts and there's people they are because people have been living there for a long time since like Roman times.

And so there's a lot of people who live there and a lot of people have died there and all of them are turned into ghosts.

There's nothing but ghosts.

Okay, that's not specific. All of them have turned into ghosts.

That's right. Every single person who's ever diagnosed in the city of Edna.

That might be a specific to Scotland. That's a ghost.

That would be an overwhelming amount of ghosts, I would think.

It's ridiculous. I mean, it's ridiculous.

Because what percentage of people turn into ghosts in other countries? Like in the United States?

I think a very small percent.

You think it's like 1%?

1 to 3% I would say.

And why do you think it is? It's because they have an unfinished business? That's what a lot of people think about ghosts.

I would assume, do you think that's the case that everything in Scotland has unfinished business?

I think that's probably right. Yeah. Because it's hard to get things done in Scotland, you know, the weather is always changing.

It's like a month and a half of vacation.

That's right. I would have done it if the sun was out in the South terrain. I couldn't get it done.

So you think a lot of ghosts are hanging around for sunny days to get stuff done.

Right.

They weren't able to get that in life.

I think that's about right. You know, you need to fix the shutters and you need to get up and refatch the roof and whatnot.

So you think a lot of ghosts are doing manual labor around the house?

It's not a little project.

Do you ever wake up and walk out to your house and go, oh my god, someone fixed the shutters in the night?

Yeah, well, that's what they do. And what it would be then is a former resident of your home who had died.

Right. And it's now a ghost and it's got sort of this light to do list.

Yep.

Things they've got to get to.

Are they trying, can they do it themselves? Can they perform the task themselves?

Or are they trying to influence humans to do well?

Yeah, you're asking the really good questions and because that's what they've got to do.

That's what we do on the show. When we talk to interesting people, we try to think of interesting questions.

Oh, that's a great one. Not because that's interesting.

Interesting people talking to interest.

Interested people talking to interesting people.

You guys are interested and I'm interested.

Yes.

But listen to this, I'm also interested.

Isn't that something?

Wow.

Right.

What are you? Interesting do you think?

No.

Oh, okay.

No, that's what's interesting.

I think that's why people probably fast forward.

Probably fast forward the first second.

Probably, right.

So answer the question.

I will.

So a ghost can certainly pick up a ghost hammer.

What is a ghost hammer?

A ghost hammer.

It's a ghostly hammer.

You know, if a ghost wanted to fix a ghost house or something like that.

Or if he wanted to hit another ghost, let's say God forbid.

So wait, wait, ghost house.

Do ghosts have houses of their own that are ethereal constructions?

Right.

They do.

And we can't see them.

If a ghost is, let me just very quickly.

If I was to be living in Scotland and in my house, which you can't do.

I mean, you're welcome to this.

But you got to get on your fucking bus.

It's a fucking bus.

For a sake of argument, let's say I'm Scottish.

All right.

And I live in Scotland, in Edinburgh, in my own home.

My home is haunted.

You're a ghost.

Yeah.

Now that ghost, when the workday is done hunting, my house goes to his own house.

A ghost house?

And is that basically on the same edifice as the real house?

Right.

If you were able to see ghostly forms, would you see the outline of a ghost house on top of a real house?

The answer is sometimes and sometimes.

Okay.

It's not one to one.

It's not one.

Sometimes you got a ghost who haunts your house for a job.

I mean, that's his job.

Oh.

Basically, it punches any punches out, right?

Usually they have ghost clocks.

Of course they do.

They do.

Yeah.

It goes time like how is he being paid?

Well, is it an hourly wage?

This is very, and I hear this.

Probably Bitcoin.

It's controversial because they know.

It's probably Bitcoin.

I mean, they're paid in ghost money, which I can't spend on things in the real world.

It's like Disney dollars.

It's like funny money at the strip club.

I don't know what that is.

Funny money at the strip club.

Yeah.

What is funny money at the strip club?

It's like a strip club that'll give you, you.

They'll give you fake dollars or something.

And you pay for that?

Yes, yes.

I don't like it when things are funny at the strip club.

I'm not there to fucking laugh.

Anyway, well, you got really dark there.

Sometimes it says a comedian up at the strip club.

They'll try that sometimes.

I know.

You're brows.

Furloughed and you are bleeding.

Sometimes my brow.

You know what I mean?

I'll furloughed so much that you can bleed.

You have that pimple right in the middle.

Just like a pop.

Sorry, guys.

I don't want to do that.

Why do you have a pimple right in between your eyebrows?

Just touched on something right there.

I've been to the dermatologist.

He says it's a perm a pimple.

Do you know those?

A purple.

It's a purple pimple.

It's not good anywhere.

It's been there 18 years already.

How do you just take a look and go?

That maybe is not going anywhere.

This is not going anywhere.

This is we could take out the whole forehead and graft on.

Oh, that's a new forehead.

Wow.

Forget it.

It's not worth it.

Yeah.

Anyway.

So some ghosts will haunt your house for a little while and then go back to their own house.

But a lot of the time you've got a ghost whose house is in your house.

Right.

And the best.

Right.

20% of it is in your house or something like that.

Yeah.

A lot of crossover.

Right.

So it happens.

But that doesn't count in the square footage of your house.

You can't count the square footage of the ghost houses.

Well, it certainly does amongst sort of like the ghost saiyan.

The ghost community.

The ghost saiyan.

We'll look at it.

Yeah.

So in your business, right, you are promoting people coming in and going to places where these ghosts live.

Are you going to the ghost houses or are you going to?

I mean, it's obviously true that there's ghosts everywhere.

And for the first, like for a while, when I did the tour, I said to people like, you don't need to go to specific places because there's ghosts everywhere, everywhere around us.

And a lot of people say, well, I feel ripped off, you know.

So you would take their money.

Right.

And then punish them that they don't need to go anywhere.

That wasn't like that money.

But I take their money.

Of course.

You take the first thing you do at the ghost tour.

We all meet right at sunset at the wee statue.

Sunset.

The wee statue, the gray friars, Bobby there.

You know the story of the gray friars, Bobby.

I don't.

Oh, don't see.

We bet.

Don't the gray friars, Bobby.

Let's hear it.

They made a movie about him Walt Disney did, but none of that is fucking true at all.

Which movie did it do?

What was that?

No, it wasn't record round.

It was a film called gray friars, Bobby.

All about record round.

We record round.

What's about a video game guy who's going around from game to game, right?

Oh, cool.

Oh, he's falling in love or he's getting back at a bad guy going from game to game and rec things or something.

All right.

Oh, OK.

Yeah, I was wondering about that.

Thank you.

But that's not like an area of my expertise.

Sure.

Have you ever played video game?

Not a single one.

I've got time.

No, that's fine.

That's understandable.

How old are you?

That's a good question.

I'm 30.

Oh, OK.

That's fine.

So you're of that generation, but maybe it just didn't connect with you.

Yeah, no, we didn't have a lot of money.

I had a question that I hope you don't mind me kind of side tracking a little bit.

No, what's the movie Zootopia about?

Oh, yeah.

Well, again, I'll do what I've seen the cover.

This is not my area of expertise.

But you do know.

Well, I'm somewhat familiar with it.

I mean, I've seen the posters and I did see a thing like.

You've never seen the film.

I've not seen the film.

Neither of us seen Ralph.

I've seen them.

I've seen posters as well.

OK.

I can only suppose.

I've seen it on my Apple TV and I wonder like, oh, should I get this or not?

But I wish I knew what it was about.

I don't think the poster does a good job communicating what the actual movie is.

So what do you think is going to be about?

It's about animals, right?

Certainly.

And they live in a city that's like a zoo, right?

Sure.

But what's it about?

Well, one of them is a rabbit.

That's world building.

Right.

What's the actual plot?

I think it's just about like, can these animals like get along and adventures and so all the sad pieces are just putting animals together and seeing if they eat each other.

Well, look, I think one of them is going from video game to video game and trying to fall in love and trying to get like a bad guy.

Maybe, maybe.

Cameron, I want to get to your tour.

What else happens on these tours because you start there at the statue of the Bobby.

That's right.

And then are there other scary things that happen?

Oh, so many scary things.

Well, look, it depends on if the what kind of a moon we've got.

If we've got a full moon and it's bright outside, well, it's a little bit different because people can see well.

But on a night when people can't see anything, then the guy that does the dog, he'll come out of the crypt and he'll get down in his hands and knees and he'll bite a few people on the ankles.

Oh, wow.

That's right.

Is he dressed as a dog?

He's just covered all in black.

I've covered it.

It just hits him black.

He's a theater station.

That's right.

You can't see him at all.

And he sneaks up and he bites and I mean, he really bites.

Yeah.

You know, is that really a friend of mine named Stuart?

And he just comes up and he just gets right in your ankles and he's got sharp teeth.

He sharpens his teeth.

Really?

That's right.

But it would like a nail finally sharpens his teeth.

To be more like a dog because you know, a dog's teeth are sharp.

Quite sharp.

Great fact.

That's right.

So he'll come up and he'll bite a few people on the ankles.

Is that the case in Milo and Otis?

Milo knows the Disney movie.

Their teeth are sharper than people's.

Yeah.

Is that how you got that fact?

I don't see that.

But I mean, from the poster I can tell.

The only film that I've seen.

You've only seen one film?

Has been Grafirous Bobby.

Oh.

Oh, okay.

Because it's connected, obviously.

Right.

You've not seen any other Scottish set movie.

What happened was they had a screening of that film and a sort and everybody there was so mad because it's total bullshit.

Not a fucking thing that happens in that movie.

What happened to what happened in the movie?

Well, in that movie it's like it's a guy, he's a shepherd, he's got a dog and he comes into town and he dies and the dog won't leave his side and he doesn't dig up anything and everybody's impressed with him and everybody loves him and he becomes a hero of the tone.

Well, a shepherd, this is the part of this movie.

A shepherd comes to town who has a dog.

Right.

And everyone's impressed with him.

I don't like it.

Right.

It's bullshit.

That's got third act problems and first and second act problems.

Yeah.

It's not a good film and it's not what happened with the real Grafirous Bobby.

We should pitch a reboot.

Pitch a reboot of Grafirous Bobby, that's the real story.

Right.

And maybe Stuart could be in it.

Stuart would love to be in.

He's filed his teeth down.

Wow.

I can't believe he filed it.

So how does the rest of his life work?

The rest of his life?

Yeah.

And when he's not being in it.

Yeah.

How many hours does he work in a week or a day?

The tour is like it's a seven hour tour.

Oh.

From sundown to sun.

That's for seven hours.

It's a seven hour tour.

Spooky.

Yeah.

Because we cover a lot of ground.

It's like a meal break.

Is there?

No, this is the middle of the night.

So people aren't traditionally eating, although they're sleeping usually then.

Which is why they're not eating.

Right.

Well, we do.

We stop in at a few different places, a few different pubs and whatnot.

You know, and so you can get a drink and maybe a ton of meat.

Maybe a Scottish egg or a Scottish egg.

I suppose, but it's no time really.

We're in a hurry.

Really?

Just time do you spend in the pubs?

In the pub, we stop it.

We stop in you a bunch of it.

And I'll tell you quite honestly the way it works is it friends.

It's a mine who won't pub see what you bring your tourists around.

Oh, right.

And make a buy.

Do you get a little kickback?

Getting a little bit of a kickback.

And we make them buy drinks, you know.

You really?

We make them buy drinks.

How do you do?

How do you make people buy drinks?

Well, I tell them you don't want to get bitten again.

Do you?

Or shoved?

Are people just bandaging their ankles at this point?

Wait, so you have other people that shove?

I've got a few guys.

How many people are you employing?

Am I employed?

Well, it's a to do.

It's different every night.

So it's like five or six guys who come along during the course of the night.

Studebite.

Does he have any other duties?

Studebite is biting.

And then they're at Gray Fryer's Courtyard.

He's also Bloody George McKenzie is buried there.

Oh, well.

Bloody George McKenzie.

I don't know his story.

Well, Bloody George McKenzie was a barrister and he was responsible for the death of like thousands and thousands of Presbyterians.

And so they buried him there.

And it is said that if you go and you visit his crypts, you might get shoved real hard into a wall.

Whoa.

No, that's right.

That's why he's going to buy the ghost of Bloody George McKenzie.

And so now do you have a friend who is steward?

Stewart does that to Stewart the guy for the Gray Fryer's Courtyard.

He does the bites and he does the shops.

Does he live nearby?

He doesn't go travel.

He lives there.

He lives right there.

He lives to be honest with he lives in the crypt in the bloody.

This is your last case.

This is your homeless guy?

Are these all homeless people that you employ?

Well, I don't really ask him too many questions.

But I don't know that none of them is ever invited me to their house.

Let's say that.

Right.

This is sort of a just trademark of a homeless person.

No house invitations.

When you could be.

When you found all these people that you employ in the different locations, right?

At which they scare people.

Did you find them living in those locations?

Usually, yeah.

Okay.

You know, those are homeless.

You go there in the daytime and they're there, they're asleep.

And you say, hey, later on at night, will you be here?

That's the other thing about homeless people always sleeping during the day.

Oh, isn't that terrible?

That's why they can't hold down jobs.

Well, that's what I think.

Yeah, that's right.

Did you get a job?

You think they are?

I think they are.

We probably have chronic fatigue syndrome or something.

Anyway, yes.

That's right.

So I'm going to take the black outfit and I take it on with me to the next stop, which is Brody's Close.

We go to Brody's Close.

I don't know.

Brody's Close.

You don't know Brody's Close.

William Brody.

He was an upstanding member of the community, except he was great.

I can't see how he's going bad.

What did you say except?

He accepts.

He had a secret.

He had a job making fixing locks and making keys for locks.

That's not much of a secret.

I mean, I would probably feel comfortable telling.

He was a locksmith.

That's right.

But that's not the secret part, Lance.

What he did with these locks is he made reproductions of locks and keys that he had no business having the locks to.

Some of them were banks and he'd sneak in and he'd steal the money.

And some of them were private houses and he'd break in and murder people.

What?

He murdered people all over town.

No.

That's right.

Wow.

And they figured it out and they hanged him.

To this day.

Oh, God.

Yes.

The ghost of William Brody is seen walking around Brody's Close on a flaming horse.

What?

That wasn't part of it.

Yeah.

What?

No, that wasn't part of what he did in life.

But that's part of the legend.

It goes around there, a flaming horse.

Did you start this part?

No, that's just part of the story.

Because flames have nothing to do with locks or any.

It's weird.

I'll admit that.

But that's part of the story.

And you can hear him jingling his keys from atop the flaming horse.

So do you have a guy jingling keys or do you have a flaming horse?

We've got both.

What?

That's right.

How do you get the...

Listen, I understand the jingling keys.

Yeah.

Are you lighting horses on fire?

Well, I mean, it's part of the story, right?

So what we do is we go down to Brody's Clos and we get a horse and we get like the oldest horse we can bring the clothes to your first.

Yes.

I bring the black outfit to the guy that plays Brody and that's a friend of my name, Doggy.

And I say, Doggy, put on the black suit.

You have to tell him to do this each time.

Every fucking night when he's got a head problem.

I suspect a lot of people probably don't even remember what's going on.

That's funny you should say that.

A few of these guys, every night I've got to explain it to them all over again.

This is a ghost chore and it's meant to be scary.

I do report on this outfit.

You got jingle some keys.

Jingle some keys and get to this horse and then...

Wait, the guy's on the horse when you light it on fire?

Of course he is.

He's right on the horse.

Cameron, is there any possibility that every night you lose a Doggy?

Well, that's interesting.

I never thought of that.

Are you just calling this person?

You're just calling...

Is each in each location?

Right.

You're calling whatever homeless person you come up on, Stewart or Doggy.

And maybe that's a...

No wonder they don't know what they're closer for.

I don't have to ever fall on that, but it would explain that they're never familiar with what they did last night.

I mean, it would explain it.

Number 10.

Oh, so good.

Classic.

So nice.

So good?

So nice.

You good?

What?

What were you gonna...

You look like you're saying don't say anything or you're saying please say something.

What's his name?

Victor actor?

What was it?

Victor!

What was it?

I think it was Justin actor.

Justin actor.

I forgot that it came out of a pun.

Justin actor.

Victor actor.

That was Andy Daley.

Always great to have.

I wish you would do the show more.

He's very, very busy.

And in demand actor.

I think he's doing it the right amount.

Do you really...

You prefer him to do it one maybe two times a year.

Yeah, I think even two times a year is like, ooh, it's a little much.

Why?

It's really?

Great episode.

Great episode, of course.

Now, when we come back, we are deep in the throes of the top 10.

We are going to have the debut of another character.

Shit.

Coming up.

This is exciting.

And the debut of a character on episode nine, wow, this is good.

All right, when we come back, we're going to have your episode nine coming back right after this.

Comedy Bang Bang.

And boy, we've been going now.

Comedy Bang Bang.

And boy.

You've been listening to it for a long time.

We've been doing this for a long time.

How do you think we feel?

Here's Scott, I sometimes wish the audience would put themselves in our shoes and socks.

And please don't let me honest.

If you're going to get my shoes, please wear some socks.

Please don't stink them up.

Let's be honest, get in our pants.

Are you trying to get in our pants?

Because you're succeeding.

Because you're in there.

Just and you know what?

Where are shirts?

Get out of our dreams and into our cars.

Please.

Into our cars?

Our cardigans.

Let me see our cardigans.

Cardigans.

All right, we're so close to the end of this particular episode and after that we're going to take a break and then come back and do our next week's episodes.

That's right.

And we'll get some of that nutrition in our body.

Does card be where cardigans?

She should.

She should wear a black and yellow striped cardigan.

Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow.

Because of B-movie.

And as a tribute to Sting.

Mm-hmm.

That's his yellow hair.

The legged black eyes.

Well, you know the story of how he became Sting.

How did he become Sting?

Tell me the story.

I love to hear the story during the holidays.

I tell this every Christmas.

A little late this year.

And Sting was a young man.

Oh, daddy.

And he was playing the jazz clubs in Newcastle.

He wore a black and yellow striped jumpback.

Black and yellow, black and yellow.

And so everyone called him Sting.

Oh.

That can't be true.

Why does he wear that?

Was that the real punk rock look?

He might have been called out.

Wearing a jumper.

Well, he was playing jazz clubs.

I don't think he was concerned with punk rock.

That, let's imagine that scenario.

Yes.

Gordon Sumner shows up.

That's right.

He's wearing a yellow and black striped thing.

That's right.

Do you go up to him and go, hey, Sting.

No, you don't.

No.

You call him Bumblebee.

You don't call him Sting.

And that's how the Transformers movies came to be.

Yes.

The story of Sting is the story of the Transformers.

Of course.

They are inexplicably intertwined.

They are intertwined and they shall never be separated.

I meant inextricably.

But I also can't explain it.

I'm like, who?

Look, you tried to.

I tried to, I tried my best.

You tried to be a star.

I tried my best.

But you failed.

I'm a failure.

Speaking of failure, let's hear an episode that is not a failure and in fact made our countdown.

Great segment.

I really, I saved it.

Oh, you're back.

This is your episode nine.

Number nine.

All right.

Episode nine, a lot of these episodes came from the same period of time.

This is from September, September 25.

This is episode 510.

That's very curious.

This is an episode called Pound Foolish.

You may remember this episode, Paul.

Oh, I do.

Because this is your third appearance on our countdown.

That's right.

Pound Foolish, this is Andy Samberg, whom people know from Saturday Night Live and the Lonely Island in Brooklyn, nine, nine.

He has a very, very busy schedule and you're the lead on a network sitcom.

You're there all the time.

That's right.

And he's a producer on it.

He's very kind enough to every year make time to be on an episode.

And this year was no exception.

He is here.

We also have Drew Tarver from Bajillion Dollar Properties.

He is playing his character Derek Contreira, who is from his own podcast.

What is the title of that podcast?

He has a podcast on engineer Cody Ryan.

What are you doing?

When I ask a question, I sit in a staring space.

There's no wonder you're fired.

Jesus fucking Christ.

Get it together, man.

What is the name of his show as Derek Contreira?

He has his own show.

Make it.

Fiddle-in with shit.

What do you do?

Strictly business with Derek Contreira.

So he was promoting that and we have the debut of a Paul F.

Tomkins original character.

That's right.

Who am I talking about?

You're talking about Mayor Junius Bobaldunary.

Mayor Junius Bobaldunary.

That's right.

Whom we recently heard from on last week's holiday episode.

That's correct.

He returned.

The debut of this character, am I right?

You are correct.

Tell us a little bit about Mayor Junius.

He is a tiny little guy.

He's from a race of people that live inside the walls.

Not the littles, not the borrowers.

Not the littles, not the borrowers, but they are a race like that and they live inside the walls of human buildings.

And how, why did you come up with this character?

What was the impetus of it?

What spurred your thinking on it?

Do you know what I will tell you that...

Don't lie.

This is the truth.

Now look, you have your hand on the Bible.

I'm the guy, one of me, one of me always lies and one of me always tells the truth.

Okay, so I'm the me that always tells the truth.

God, I can't figure this out.

There's no way of knowing.

So I was on tour with Amy Mann.

This years ago, oh years ago.

Oh years ago.

Okay.

And we were going to...

Or were you like a roadie or...

Yeah.

I loaded your equipment.

I also dumped drugs.

Of course, that's what it is.

Just hauling cases.

Hauling cases.

Every night she would sing a special song for me, The Loadout by Jackson Brown.

Of course.

And then at the end of her performance she would take off her guitar strap and drop her guitar and if you weren't there to catch it, underneath her.

I had to pay for the guitar.

Right.

Yeah.

For therapy for the guitar.

Yeah, I had to send the guitar to a guitar therapist.

Which first of all to find one is a pain in the ass.

We were losing it so much earlier than normal.

I know.

Anyway.

Amy.

We were on our way to Tarrytown, New York.

Ah yes, we've played Tarrytown.

Yes.

I've never been there by sleepy hollow.

That's right, exactly.

And so, so quaint and everything that we started talking about Tarrytown and the idea that Tarrytown currency was cookies.

I think that's when I started saying, that's first time I started doing that voice.

I am the mayor of Tarrytown.

Our currency is cookies.

And that was said a lot on the tour.

And like every day since then or?

Yeah, every day since then.

Every hour on the tower.

That's right.

That's how people know, oh, it's three o'clock.

Yeah, you know, I live in a clock.

I live in a clock and I come out and I say every hour on the hour, I have no idea that you live in a clock.

You live in a clock.

And that wall is missing.

You lost the wall.

That's where the wall is.

Oh wow.

Oh.

Yes?

Yeah.

So that was always, that was a joke with Amy and the other people on the tour for a long time and would be referenced every once in a while just amongst ourselves.

And I wanted to do a new character and I don't know why that occurred to me to do, but I thought it would be fun to do.

And it was fun.

And it was fun and so much fun that it made number nine on our countdown.

I'm thrilled.

That was a fun episode.

This is a great episode.

We all had fun during it.

So why don't you have fun listening to a selection from it?

We did our part.

So now you.

Everyone's got a job here.

By the way, I was, I was looking at Joe Walsh albums for some reason.

Sure.

Oh, because your anniversary is coming up.

But this made me laugh and I've seen it a few times, but the title of one of his albums is you bought it, you name it.

It made me laugh though, like, like he's sitting around going, God, I got to come over the title of this fucking album.

You bought it, you name it.

It's terrible.

I thought it was funny.

Well, you know what's not terrible and is funny is this episode.

This is your episode number nine pound foolish comedy bang bang.

Number nine.

All right, let's get to our next guest.

He is the, he's a politician.

That's wonderful to hear.

I think more people should be should be out there trying to make a difference in their own communities.

And we'll certainly hear about his.

I don't have your name, sir.

All I have is politician.

Well, first of all, down here, look down here.

I'm looking at empty air.

You certainly you couldn't be lower than that.

Very small.

At eye level.

I'm looking at empty air eye level.

That's about where a human being should be.

That's not where I am.

So you're saying to look downward?

Look downward and you shall see me.

Certainly I'll look two inches lower.

Nope.

No, that's me anything.

All right, three inches.

Go as far as three inches.

Nope.

Nothing.

Please I pray you look a little tidy bit lower.

I'll add three feet to it, but no more.

Whoa.

There you are.

Hello, me to introduce myself.

I am Mayor Junius Bobboudary.

Come on.

What?

Spell it.

J-U-N-I-U-S-B-O-B-B-L-E-D-O-O-N-A-R-Y Junius Bobboudary.

My apologies.

Junius Bobboudary.

Yes, I'm the mayor of the people that live inside the walls.

Oh, wait a minute.

I've heard of these people.

Yeah.

Wait a minute.

No, I haven't.

This is ridiculous.

You haven't heard of us.

People live inside the walls.

Andy, have you heard about these people?

Yeah, the littles.

Oh, no.

No, not the littles.

We're not the borrowers.

Okay.

Yeah.

Oh, I didn't think I was going to come up against this.

Wait, are you mice?

What's that?

Are you mice?

No, I'm a...

I'm clearly a little guy.

I don't know.

I mean, it's just as weird to have a little human being as it is an anthropomorphic mouse.

Yeah, that may be.

I'm a guy.

You're wearing a hat.

I can't see if you have mouse ears.

Okay, let me take my hat off.

I'm a person.

And also, I can't tell if you have a tail because you're wearing pants.

I don't have a tail.

Well, take your pants off.

Here we go.

Whoa.

Yeah.

Happy?

No, tail.

That's right.

Oh, butthole.

Okay.

Look, I hold elected office.

This is humiliating.

This looks bad to my constituents that I take my pants off for this guy.

I beg your pardon.

We're not taking photos, though.

This is it.

Oh, thanks.

In the oral media.

I appreciate it.

And I'm so happy when I got here to be interviewed.

Now, this is what a drag this is.

This is an oral medium like that Dors movie, I guess.

Oh, boy.

You're sexist.

You're a piece of dog shit, human.

So Mayor Junius.

Please call me Mayor Bobbalduttery.

Thank you.

Sorry, Junius.

All right.

There are a race of human beings living inside the walls?

I mean, we're not technically human beings.

We're our own species.

Are you magical creatures?

No, I wish we were.

We're just little.

And you choose to live inside of the walls?

Well, it's safer that way because we're out of the way of cats, dogs, and so forth.

Ah, I see.

Yes, I see.

So, we've always lived inside the dwellings of human beings.

I see how ancient.

Oh, well, how ancient are human beings?

And they're dwellings.

Okay.

Well, the earth is approximately 2,000 years old.

I beg your pardon.

So what are these guys?

So dwellings probably were in the first hundred years.

From the days of the cavemen, we lived inside the walls of the caves.

Really?

We would burrow in there in our little holes, our little hidey holes.

Did your ancestors look like cavemen then?

Of course.

Yeah.

But we totally mimicked human evolution.

We were little guys with big crazy fow heads and like big clubs and like of course, cheetah underwear.

Of course, cheetah underwear, the whole dine.

Right.

And then you mimicked human beings as they progressed.

We evolved alongside it.

The powdered wigs.

Yes, Susan powder.

What?

Pouted wigs during the 1700s.

Yes, that's right.

Susan powder?

She mentioned Susan powder.

What is your relation to Susan powder?

Susan powder was one of us at one point.

What?

She got big.

She was enlarged?

Yes, she made a wish.

What about Daniel powder?

Daniel powder?

He's just a regular...

Who's that?

Who's Daniel powder again?

Is that a guy whose things had a bad day?

Oh, is it?

Probably.

What about powder?

The guy on the movie powder?

Yeah, he's bald and white.

Well, he's a different kind of guy.

He's a different guy.

I feel like he's probably had a couple of bad days.

Yeah, that's true.

Daniel powder, he probably is the guy.

Certainly the director of that film caused them bad days for some people.

He certainly did.

Anyway, look it up gang.

Look it up gang.

So, what are you doing here?

I want everyone to know that we exist and I want everyone to embrace us as a sort of cousin of the human race.

We don't want to hide anymore.

We want to come out of the walls and be friends with mankind because we consider ourselves related to you in some way.

We look just like you.

We act like you in many ways.

We have a society.

We were all over the world.

Some of us are in space.

We had to go up in the international space shuttle.

That's right.

Do you have your own space shuttles, tiny ones, or do you go up in the regular size?

We board holes into the regular size.

Oh, okay.

You guys made anything or do you just bore holes into all of our shit?

Well, here's the thing.

We make do with what is around.

And so, sometimes we consider human beings nice enough to lend us things without their consent.

So you've never made anything of your own?

We've made things out of existing things.

Like we'll take a thimble and we'll make it into a table.

Like that kind of stuff.

But what do you make chairs out of as thimbles or tables?

Well, you know those discarded champagne cages?

Sure.

We make those into chairs all the time.

Wow, okay.

That was a nice thought.

Mm-hmm.

Well, I'm sorry.

I was very impressed.

You pulled that.

Oh, well.

I mean, it's just what happened.

It's just what happened.

I know.

I'm just...

That's like me saying George Washington was our first president and you going, wow, I'm impressed.

I am impressed with that knowledge.

Oh, thank you.

I don't know the names of the presidents.

But I do know that Jim Morrison's girlfriend's name was Pamela Corson.

Oh!

Did you know that?

You're bubble.

Bubble dinner!

How dare you?

Look at your whiteboard.

I remember I turned the doors off pretty early.

I wasn't into it.

I wasn't a big doors fan anyway.

Were you seeing it in a normal size theater?

Yes.

That must be like IMAX to you.

Every movie is like IMAX to us.

I'm like an iPhone.

It's IMAX.

No, an Iphone is like regular size movie screen.

And then an iPad is IMAX.

iPad is probably like Stidorama.

And then...

A television, a normal size television screen would be like...

What's a normal size TV screen these days though?

That's true.

They're getting smaller or sometimes.

It's crazy.

No, they're getting bigger.

What are you talking about?

I don't know.

Why would TV screens get smaller?

Because people...

I don't know.

I mean, we would want that, but that's not happening, Jack.

Yeah.

Are things ever too big for you?

Most times?

Yes.

You're in about the thimble, right?

I did.

Take a thimble, we put a coat button on there.

That's a table.

Got it.

And then you're fashioning like ironworks out of this campaign.

Yes.

And it's hard to do because our, you know, we're little.

Sure.

You don't have the proportional strength of a regular size human being.

No, why would we?

Well, Ray Palmer, the atom has that.

So I just wondered if you shared those qualities.

No, I don't share those qualities with your weird comic book people.

Well, guess what?

I don't have a weird race of little people that I did not know exist until now.

And you may as well be as mythical as a comic book.

Let me tell you something.

Yeah.

I am a duly appointed representative of my people.

I come from a place where everyone is very adorable.

You are adorable.

I have to say.

Yes, you know that I am.

You're cute as a button, which I guess is you're cute as a table.

Cookies are a currency.

Really?

Yes.

Like regular size cookies or giant cookies?

Little cookies.

Cookie crisps.

Wait, why would it be regular size cookies?

Well, the killer else is giant cookies.

Regular size cookies.

But what?

Are they giant cookies to us or to you?

What do you consider the regular size, like regular size cookies, like regular to us?

Perforged it to us?

Yeah.

I'm saying like, do you have, do you use currency as tiny, tiny cookies to us, not to you, to us or to use our regular size cookies?

You're a prospective Scott.

See, this is a quarter next to this thing.

So I can get some respect.

You say regular size.

I guess I'm a sizes.

Yeah, that is.

It's prejudice.

And a racist.

And you're a racist.

That's just me.

That's me, Andy speaking, just on the record.

Thank you, Andy.

You're a racist.

I've known Scott a long time.

See, you can confirm this.

Yes.

Then he is a racist.

And a sexist.

You're not supposed to let anyone know.

And a sizes.

Do you, what size just then give me accurate measurements?

What size are these cookies you're using as cookies?

Let me open up my wallet.

Here.

That wallet, it looks like it's in the shape of a cookie.

Yeah, it makes things easier.

Right.

What, your wallet is shaped like money, right?

Well, I mean, it's not shaped like quarters.

But it is shaped like dollar bills.

You're right.

Folded over.

Can I ask the mayor a question?

Yes.

The upcoming Alexander Payne documentary downsizing about how people are good.

Oh, there's more.

Yeah.

That wasn't a question.

Yeah, it didn't go out the end.

Sorry.

I think these have you done?

I'm kidding.

500 and something.

So are you, is your community worried about the our size human race being downsizing sort of flooding your population?

Yeah, that's a great question.

Oh, well, would there be a housing shortage?

Yeah.

Oh, so you're, hold on a second.

I think we're talking about two different things.

Are you thinking that we're concerned that the human race is going to be made smaller?

Yeah.

Yeah, we're not.

I mean, because that's not what that word means.

Down, you mean downsizing, but that's what happens in the movie downsizing is the documentary.

It's yeah, Matt Damon becomes smaller in it.

Yeah.

Matt Damon's in the documentary.

Yeah.

Okay, guys, what's going on here?

He's getting made smaller guys in real life guys.

Look at look at me.

His character's name is Matt Damon.

Is that a look?

This is a great question.

Our websites, the same title, even though they're bigger, like, would it be like really big?

I am our websites, webs that can see what are we doing?

Guys, I came all the way from out of the wall for this.

It's your fault.

You don't know the plot of downsizing.

The plot, the trailer came out two days ago.

Have you not seen it?

I'm, look, I'm sorry.

I got stuff to do.

Matt Damon gets shrunk down in it.

And so are you concerned that what happens in the movie?

A whole lot of second.

Is this?

I got to ask.

Let's step out of whatever ironic detachment right now.

Is this movie actually called downsizing?

Yes.

It is actually about a guy who should be.

Yes.

Okay.

That's not good.

I'm not arguing with that.

Should we watch the trailer while we sit here?

Well, it's a little product placement for downsizing.

Why?

Coming out soon.

It makes me wonder what Pamela Corson might do.

Probably blow the guy who gets shrunk down.

Hey, come on.

We don't know what her family's up to now.

So in this movie, Matt Damon gets shrunk down.

Are you concerned this is going to happen to the rest of the human rights?

No.

Susan Powder got enlarged.

Yeah, that was a weird day.

How did that happen?

As I said, she made a wish.

To whom?

To the universe or to a specific being?

It's overpopulation.

We're proud to unveil.

Okay, shut up for a second.

That sounds like Terran Stamps.

Does it?

It does sound like Terran Stamps.

Yes, I'm ready.

Where's the Brian Cox?

I bet those guys can stand like end up.

And Cox.

Yeah.

Those are two words you don't want to hear next to each other.

Boy, oh boy.

Wow.

That's Matt Damon.

That is wild, isn't it?

That is wild stuff.

I just pare them out.

That's Dave Damon Johnson.

That's wild stuff.

That's you too, Johnny Garza.

I do.

That's what I'm saying.

Do you have tiny celebrities?

Like do you have a tiny Dana Carvey?

Well, we don't.

We don't let him rap about saving the planet.

Yeah.

Down sizing is about saving yourself.

We have a Dana Carvey equivalent, a guy who does impressions of, you know, other people of like a rich little rich, really little.

Is that what he's called?

He actually is called rich, really little.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

I put this on for the mayor to understand.

Oh, well, you get it.

Oh, I, I, maybe I didn't make it clear.

Not interested.

Number nine.

Ah, good stuff.

Good stuff.

That was fun.

That was a fun fun.

Also, but you know, calling back to a topic we discussed a couple episodes ago, Andy, between during the breaks, was talking about my appearance on Brooklyn nine nine.

Yes.

And, yeah, we wasted you.

Like there's no way to have that character on again.

Yeah.

Like, why, why did we do that?

Well, you find, you find that with shows, you know, early on in the runs, they're like, you know, they want to get their friends on.

So, you know what I mean?

So they're like, in case the show is canceled, we got to get our friends on and got to put them in parts.

So they'll give good actors like you.

And I know, Neil Campbell, I know that they had him on because they love him there.

He's a Neil Campbell who's on the show quite a lot.

He's a producer on that show.

I think he's a producer.

Yeah, he is on that show.

And they were, I think for weeks, they're like, we got to find something for Neil.

He's so funny.

And then, you know, he too was like in a role that would never come back.

He also worked there.

He's taking someone else's job.

Right.

That's true.

But I mean, yeah, sort of in a little Steven on Sopranos way.

Yeah, like a Sean Clemence.

Right.

Yeah.

They established the Sean Clemence rule at Fox.

I mean, that was another one where he's like, yeah, man, we should have had you in a bigger part.

He said that on the day.

Yeah.

Like on the set.

He said, right.

Right.

He said, you're doing this?

Right.

Wow.

Okay.

And I believe I, and I texted you this, he had so much fun on that episode.

He texted me to say, man, those guys are funny.

I love Paul F.

Tompkins.

That's very nice.

And I passed that on.

You do not have to say that on the mic.

That's embarrassing now.

But I mean, you know, that's just a testament to how, what a wonderful, I don't know where I'm going with this.

Fuck this.

Okay.

Oh, it's in the middle of saying something nice about me.

How the fuck this?

Like, yeah, fuck this.

It's a testament to your kids.

You're like, kids of this guy's ass.

What am I doing this for?

Fuck this.

Okay.

We're just about done.

But I do want to play something.

Oh.

These, at the end of these episodes, last episode we play, we, we sang.

Yeah.

Our new recording knows that only one ago.

Yeah, please don't joke about itonya this Christmas, which by the way, a lot of people, I have to say this as a, as a disclaimer.

Yeah.

A lot of people after I already had said to you, hey, we should sing, please don't joke about itonya this Christmas.

A lot of people sent me on Twitter, hey, what if you did please don't joke about itonya this Christmas.

So I'm not stealing your idea.

Right.

This was, this has been in the mo, it's been in the works and in motion for a long time.

But each of these episodes, I want to do a little something like that.

So this episode, I want to play a little something that someone made.

This is Ben Plum, aka at bin plum, B E E E N plum.

P U.

Fuck.

Here is not bean plum.

Bean plum with a B at the end, but it's Ben plum.

Bean plum.

Yeah, bean plum.

We do these episodes every once in a while called solo bolo episodes, me and Ben Schwartz.

And Ben and I do episodes just the two of us and we sing a lot on them and...

Castles in the sky.

And in this episode, the one that was on this year that we did the solo bolo syncholo, we did a little rap, Ben did a freestyle rap with me beatboxing in the back.

And this person did a remix of it that was so good I wanted to play it.

So we're going to play this as we go out.

This is Ben Plum's remix of Benny Schwoz freestyle rap on solo, the Google burger remix.

Let's hear this right now.

Something I don't know, but look, this is a solo bolo syncholo.

We...

We're gonna take a break when we come back.

Solo bolo syncholo.

We're gonna be doing the Olympic song shout.

Solo bolo syncholo.

Everybody's talking solo.

Solo bolo syncholo.

Call the ladies in the back, J. solo.

Solo bolo syncholo.

All the muffins always wanna say solo.

Solo bolo syncholo.

I'm a baby listening to solo bolo.

Get out my way, you'll get a close because of the stable ass knees.

I come when you're facing and I take your balls of fucking place in history like MJ2.

Everybody knows you don't have to be a jute to rap and see you right through all the raps that God he says is to.

Scott off, come in, Scott a sweet dick, he likes to fuck around.

Hold on a second.

How do you know my dick is so sweet?

Bring the beat back.

Try to get a big dick, got a small two.

Got two sticks for me and you.

We won the big ones, the small ones.

The medium to all your dance.

We didn't, I don't know what to do with.

Scott liked the fuck three girls at the same time.

Make you wanna go, make you wanna run through.

Make you see yourself in the different ways.

Scott, awkward.

Scott makes you wanna say, hey, what's the deal with all these drinks?

The people wanna see you and get a little twigs.

Twigs bars make you feel real good.

Do you wanna snap a go?

I know that too.

If you, no Scott and you know that, I'm gonna miss the girls go.

Ooh, I'm Volleyana.

Miss the guys say, ooh, see you, do.

And the body that's a do is beat that too.

Eat that too, Scott.

Eat that, eat that too, Scott.

Eat that too, Scott.

Eat that.

What a fucking do, Scott.

Whoa.

We'll be right back.

That is pretty impressive, Ben Trump.

That's great.

Really good.

I was surprised when I heard it that we were able to keep a pretty consistent beat going.

I didn't know the fruits had first names.

I always love when people send us stuff like that.

Love when the listeners send us artwork and remixes and stuff like that.

It's great.

So this brings us to the end of this episode, Paul.

So sad.

You and I are gonna take a break just like Ross and Rachel.

And we were on a break.

You know?

Yeah, I know.

We're gonna come back on New Year's Day and we're gonna be counting down episodes eight through five on New Year's Day and then the following Thursday we're gonna be doing your top four.

This is very exciting.

They get better and better as we go along.

Prepare your mind and body for what is to happen.

Sorry, how are people gonna prepare their bodies?

Well, they should eat food every day.

Okay, that's just regular maintenance.

Shower.

That's all you're talking about.

Yeah.

Okay, yeah.

So just, you know, do what you normally do.

You're crazy.

Now you're acting like I'm crazy and I don't appreciate that.

I don't appreciate the things that you do appreciate.

Remember where I talked about how we're gonna be shouting all the time?

Can I see you with a kitchen for a second?

Give me.

Okay, what do you need?

Please don't do this.

I don't like embarrassing.

You're embarrassing me.

Okay, I'm sorry.

I apologize.

I love you.

You love you.

I love you.

You know, I mean, all right, we'll see you next time.

Thanks bye.

Bye.

I love you.
