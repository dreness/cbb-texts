four years?

you're going to say 40 years five years?

for 40 years four or five years you both share a love of comedy and boxing I know you both box, right?

we love boxing do you like boxing?

I probably love comedy more than you do yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true but when you do a thing, you got to hate on it a little bit you like seeing comedy more than I do and I like let's not fight, girls, come on oh, we weren't fighting first time I have two girls on the show, all of a sudden the claws are out oh, is this a theme show?

this is the mildest cat fight ever I wasn't even aware that we were disagreeing but we'll take our tops off anyway oh, wait a minute Amy, stop, no, put it on things got very sexy here in the studio Morgan, you're away from people so did you have a boyfriend before you went?

do you have a long distance relationship going on?

I'm single, I'm about as single as you can get and I don't have a boyfriend, but I'm not gay you're about as single as a one dollar bill I'm a single as a one dollar bill I feel like people are going to think I'm gay because I feel like they think I'm gay when I'm on stage but I also think I have kind of a man-ish voice and I'm worried about the radio sure, people, until this moment, no one knew you were a girl because of your voice, I have to say until we mentioned that I had two girls on the show somebody did come up to me at a bar in New York and said and she was European, so I think she was very legit she said, she was a photographer I don't really do accents, but she said I am a photographer and I look at you and I would like to photograph you and I was mildly flattered she goes, because I photograph androgynous women I wasn't going for that I was like, jokes on you lady, I'm a man but no, I'm single, I'm dabbling I tried the phone, not phone, sex what do you call that?

texting, sexting?

sexting, I guess sexted, a sex message why are you laughing?

isn't that what the kids do now?

sure they sext I learned it on Law and Order what can't you learn on Law and Order these days?

it's so ripped from the headlines that I do use it as a news source now like if it's a thing, I'm like, oh that must be happening right now so wait, hold on, back up you said that you actually have been sexting things got very sexy in the studio again yeah, I was on my couch in New York Friday night watching Battlestar Galactica season 4 on DVD it was very sexy I'm peeling the onion right now, you know what I mean?

slowly let's see those layers I want to just titillate the crowd what's inside that onion?

inside the onion was, I got a text from a fella from a gentleman caller gentleman caller, gentleman texter literally a gentleman caller at this point and he's like, what are you doing?

and I was like, I'm just lying here I didn't talk about the Battlestar Galactica part and then it just kind of started he was like, I'm 27, I've never done this before I'm a little bit prude, but I discovered eyeliner this year I figure I'm on the path to something just let's follow it and he said he just started he's like, hey, I'm so hard right now is what he said, right?

so then I'm like, my area is also ready or whatever you're supposed to say your area, yes my area, I'm reserved sure, as technical as you can be I'm classy I'm a classy lady and it goes back and forth about sex and whatnot you know, boobs and things I got them, you want to touch them and then at the end I guess it was wrap up time because he said, I would can I say this?

he said, I would like to come in you oh, in you, wait a minute, in you?

yeah, in me okay, alright like to come in you and it was nice of him to state his objective sure you know, I think and then I first of all, I have the iPhone it was very difficult to text with sometimes no keyboard, sure no keyboard an auto-correct function usually takes care of it I can't yeah, but they don't know a lot of words especially the words that you'd be using in this particular setting but I made a very simple mistake I meant to write because I thought I meant to write oh God because that's a good start meat and potatoes sexting oh God come in me, yes okay that's good that's very good that would make you come that would get the job done yes instead, I write it's a very simple mistake it's one letter a big difference I write oh God come in me eyes what?

come in me eyes like a pirate you added an E come in me eyes I added an E to the beginning of yes accidentally and I sent the completely wrong message now I'm like come in me eyes matey next time you see him you're going to have a strange encounter I can never have real sex with him now because it will only be it'll be just right in your eyes and I'm like that was a typo I didn't want it nobody that's not a thing that people want I have an iPhone no, come on alright, well we'll have more of Morgan coming up let's do another song this is Sarah Silverman from the Jesus's Magic soundtrack this is Nobody's Perfect on Indie103.1 Comedy Death Ray because I wear sandals you know, he wore sandals but mostly we have the same hair oh, Indie103.1 that's an unexpected ending to that song this is Comedy Death Ray this is Scott Aukerman my co-host Amy Mann special guest Morgan Murphy I do want to say we have Doug Benson coming up and the world debut this is exciting, is it not?

please, confirm the excitement that's in the studio Amy, if you would are you referring to the world debut of your single?

my new single which I have not even shared the details of with you my co-host you had no idea coming in I've kept it on lockdown that keeps it more exciting yeah, it really does because now all of a sudden no one has these preconceived notions what are you wearing, Morgan?

are those 3D glasses?

yeah they are 3D glasses I stole them from when I went to see Up I didn't put them back in the glasses recycling bin because I wanted to remember my experience those look a little bigger than the normal 3D glasses those are like Joan Crawford yeah, they're new they went all out this time if you didn't want me to keep them you should have made them out of paper like in olden times that's true paper and cellophane olden times, four years ago we do have one other special guest in the studio this guy I met down at the Grove I find his business and him to be fascinating this is the owner of Bakery for Dogs Richard Leslie in the studio hi, how are you, Scott?

hello, Richard it's great to see you again obviously we've met before thank you for having me on your show this is so exciting now, you run the Bakery for Dogs we should explain the Grove to non-LA residents the Grove is a large shopping center downtown it's got a choo-choo train and magic water and art galleries and the best Jamba Juice in Los Angeles oh, yeah, that is a great Jamba Juice especially if Carol's working now, but the store that you own Bakery for Dogs is a little unique, yeah Bakery expressly for dogs yes, and I started a trend it's a trend now there's a lot of them in LA and kind of around the states but Bakery for Dogs started it a lot of imitators pretenders to the throne Three Dog Barkery Barkingham Palace they stole my idea Scones and Bones sure, sure Dog House of Pies oh, there's more, okay more? Are there any more?

no, well, Raise the Woof Raise the Roo Woof?

no, Raise the Woof I said it wrong I'm still upset about it that girl worked for me for two and a half months and she was stealing my business plan really? Just a business plan?

Puppy Muffins oh, okay there's one place I really am upset they cater to dogs without homes it's called a Strakery now, does anyone know what that means when they drive by?

it's a big sign they explain underneath oh, they explain, okay footnotes so, your shop is beautiful yours is just called Bakery for Dogs Bakery for Dogs there's no pun in the title do you think that if you had added a pun maybe there wouldn't be all these other shops well, I was originally called the Bakery for Dogs but the R fell off and I have not been able to find another R it's a beautiful shop if people are out there today at the Grove come on in thank you for bringing that up because my aesthetic is I want the place to sort of say what I think so when you walk into the Bakery for Dogs what you see is you're basically visually greeted by a burst of I like to think what's going on in people's heads when they come in is they hear me say, through my shop they hear me say, hey, welcome to Bakery for Dogs we've got every kind of bake treat your dog could ever want or need we've got lobster opsa scones we've got we've got Bichon freeze muffins we've got Saint Bernard lattes but that's not all we've got plenty of other things a dog should never have yeah, we've got dog briefcases dog skateboards dog parachutes dog eyeglasses dog computers dog boots dog cell phones and one day with the help of science we'll have teeny tiny dogs so the dogs can have dogs for pets that's what I think that they say huh, that's interesting I studied scene design in junior college didn't you have a theme song at one point for ain't nothing but a bakery for dogs at the Grove that's good that's my favorite theme song thank you Amy, what do you think of that theme song as a songwriter I think it's concise it tells you what you need to know it's catchy it provides the information and it does it quick I don't think I've heard those lyrics in any other song no, because that's what it is and that's where it is and it takes away it demystifies the whole dog bakery process like, look, ain't nothing but a bakery for dogs it makes you feel like anyone can go there you don't have to have a dog or know anything about baking now, did you mention ain't is a great levelizer did you mention lattes yeah, I heard that as well yeah, well, a lot of people like coffee a lot of dogs like coffee with their muffins just like us but do you drink the latte out of a doggy bowl yeah does the doggy dish no, it's for dogs coffee for dogs so it's shaped like a little doggy dish does it have a protective plastic thing on the top that they can sip out of a little hole travel just so they don't burn their mouths no, no we do have dog commuter mugs okay how did you get this idea?

I mean, it's pretty interesting not a lot of people are doing it you know, it's interesting a lot of people ask me that and there's always one of two things that I tell people usually the first thing I say is I was baking muffins for my nephew's bar mitzvah and then my great Bernard my St. Bernard zipper came in saw the muffin mix, ate it all up and a light bulb went off over my head and I thought dogs like baked goods too wait, now that's what you usually tell people what is the real reason?

I eat dog food okay, well it's just easier the first one's easier I don't tell the other one until people get to know me and I feel like I know you, Scott thank you, I appreciate that alright, well, Richard anything else you want to say about the store?

well, I guess if you come on by tomorrow I'll be there all day we're celebrating our Bark Appendance Day now, do you think that if you just put bark in any word it kind of is a pun?

yes because as far as I know, bark does not rhyme within the first part of independence right maybe like rin tin tin dependence that's not bad I don't think dogs should be actors I don't like that I think it's exploitive I am selling special dog bandanas dog bandanas?

yes, because I think it's really offensive that people let their dogs walk around naked so you think a bandana takes care of that?

sure you see Porky Pig with just a shirt you don't think he's naked oh, I do have to go, but I did want to say one thing I have very tasteful Michael Jackson funeral shirts for sale for dogs?

or just for humans?

for dogs for dogs okay, so if you want your dog to also be in mourning like many Angelenos and people across the world are they knew before anybody else really?

most likely an earthquake the dogs were going off I thought, I bet you celebrity's dead I went on to TMZ and there it was wow, I had no idea are the really serious Michael Jackson dog fans are they weird too?

like the serious people fans are they just weirder dogs?

I don't know what you mean by weird as well are they quirky?

are they a little off?

I'm not sure Richard exactly knows what that word means, weird because he has nothing really to gauge it against I mean, here's the thing a lot of Michael Jackson dog fans dogs that are fans of Michael Jackson yes, okay we're on board with the premise, yes, go on a lot of them actually don't look ridiculous in giant sunglasses I don't know why that is but for a lot of dogs it just seems like a kind of a kind of a Sambo move but they pull it off alright Richard, I want to thank you so much for coming thanks Scott, say hi to Rocky that is my dog, thank you very much he's in all the time oh, what does that mean, translated?

oh, he'll know I'll just play him the recording of you doing that if you don't mind Richard Leslie, we're going to be right back on the other side of this this is R.O.Mance on Indie 103.1, this is Comedy Death Ray It's stuck in this rock bottom on its own pitch I don't know if I'll ever rise above this tone What could possibly change the timbre of my voice If she walked in in a party dress She walked in and made me sing like this She walked in and she raised my voice She walked in and I had no choice If she left me, I fell into a deep depression Would my low voice ever rise back up again Then I met a new girl, her cashier and her chip shop And she made my voice rise wide back up to the top But I left her, she snored in her sleep My voice went back to sounding deep And the first girl came back She said she was sorry that she'd never leave me She'd be with me forever So I killed her, stabbed her with a butcher's knife Her singing in this low voice tied round alike Singing this high takes a lot of debut It's really difficult to do it all at once Then after a protracted call battle I was cleared of murder charges and did some soul searching I discovered that I have a high voice in me A high voice that resides in me naturally I don't need to find love to sing this high anymore No no no no Hi hi hi hi Murder murder murder Why why why why Post post post Treble treble treble Deep deep deep Shallow shallow shallow Boy boy boy Girl girl girl Hate hate hate Love love love La la la Oh oh oh La la la Ya ya ya ya ya The best of our romance That song is on it as well as some of the songs he did live last week That's on AST Records Which you can get to at ASTRecords.com It's really really funny It's basically him doing that character of an 80's Synth new wave act For the entire record It's really funny What do you think about that Amy?

It sounds more like documentary to me You started the 80's with Till Tuesday That's pretty much the kind of thing we did Except I think my fake English accent Wasn't as strong Were you actually doing a faking?

No but then it was pretty prevalent And there was probably little things that would creep in I think I was a little less English accent-y than some of them Were you a fan of new wave music And that's why you started that?

I was totally into that So what types of groups were you into?

The Human League?

I thought they stunk Really?

I thought they stunk and I still do What about ABC?

The Cutting Crew I think I liked ABC at the time And then Adamant And I can't believe I'm in many of those And Thompson Twins Oh they were great Howard Jones What is love?

He posed the big questions Who's the one you blinded me with science?

Thomas Dolby Actually his first record was awesome I actually loved number two His second record with Hyperactive on it I was probably over it by then So you got into new wave Because you actually like new wave music And then when did you make the switch into Your new style Which is more singer-songwriter AM Gold type arrangements I think Probably Towards the end of Till Tuesday put out We put out three records And about the third one That's when I started writing songs Like on my own and kind of Kicking over the traces of the new wave thing And was it because you Got turned on to music That you previously hadn't heard Or just you got back in touch with I think it's more I got back in touch with stuff That I really actually liked I started in a punk band Oh really? What were they called?

The Young Snakes The scariest snakes It wasn't even It was more like Punk-y, art rock Very atonal Really Inspired by sort of magazine or Yeah that kind of thing Throbbing Gristle The Slits I was a big fan of Oh they're back together putting out a new record Do you remember Nina Hagen way back in the day Thomas Dolby produced her records I was almost exclusively Influenced vocally by her I was trying to do this sort of Faux, punk-y, operatic thing That was unbelievable Do you like listening to your old records?

No, no, no But what about your old solo records?

Do you like listening to those?

It's not like I do listen to them I've recently been listening to them because You're going on tour Yeah I'm going on tour You have to relearn the lyrics Well I had this idea That I would do an all requests Or mostly request show So I thought I'll just brush up On my old songs but there's like 90 songs and there's no Brushing up, I don't remember any of that stuff How do you take the requests For the tour? Is it Like people text in when they're at the tour We're going to leave We print it up like a little Flyer thing, we're going to leave on people's seats That says do you have a request for Amy Or do you have a song for Amy Or a question And then instructions To fold it into a paper airplane And then try to hit you with it So whatever gets on stage You're just going to be picking up random trash during the show That sounds fun I might have like a volunteer sort of like Pick them up and write them on a big dry erase board So everybody can see the possibilities May I be that volunteer?

Can I go on tour with you?

I get one of the bunks in the tour bus We don't have a bus Do you take the private jet everywhere?

The U2 jet?

The paper airplane jet The vertigo jet you just take from city to city Where are you kicking off that tour?

In Vermont Really? Yeah Why Vermont? I don't know I have nothing to do with booking the tour How long is the tour going on?

I'm surprised I even know what the first show is Because I don't pay attention to it at all How long is the tour?

That's three weeks Is that long for tours or is that short for tours?

Well for me I don't like to go out more than three weeks Because you sort of lose your mind Right Have you ever done a Metallica style tour Which lasts a year and a half for two years?

It's insane I wouldn't be able to handle it So no new material for this tour No new record?

Are you putting out an EP, a concert EP Anything like that? No You put out records so infrequently You gotta get more every six months Like back in the 60s Not much I put out a record, then I tour for about a year And then I'm exhausted And I say never again So that's to the point where I am About now Where I've had a few months off And have started writing songs But now I'm going back out for the summer And I'll probably start recording In the fall But you record, then you make the record Then six months from that It takes six months to set it up I know it, I have my single coming out We're going to debut it So I'm going to get into the routine Now is the perfect time We've perfectly segwayed into No, I'm not going to be doing it now The Scott Ackerman musical debut No, it's coming up more towards the end of the show Wait, I have an idea Only because Scott, you seem to have a lot of free time Amy, do you have an opening act For this kind of this tour?

I have one song And I can perform it as many times as you want Yes, over and over Let me ask you this Are people only supposed to Request your songs or can they request any songs?

I don't know other people's songs I'm not one of those musical geniuses Can I request Batdance?

I don't even know what that is Prince's song from Batman, Batdance Which uses Snippets of conversation from the movie Batman I never see the Blockbuster movie And it uses It's retarded Alright, we're going to have more with Amy We're going to have more with Morgan Plus some special guests, Doug Benson coming up after this Comedy Death Ray!

The Wiz You were in a movie with Michael Jackson A lot of people don't know that Well, a lot of people know it now Because I was yapping about it on my podcast That started playing People were listening to it right before And on the day Michael Jackson died It was kind of weird timing on that Doug has a podcast called I Love Movies You can get on iTunes But you were in Captain EO with Michael Jackson You were a dancer in that Which is always a fascinating fact About Doug is that he has actually Been in a lot of movies as an extra And you were You were saying that you were dancing as poorly as you could Just so people would notice you Well, I just thought that I would Help myself out I knew it was going to be an attraction at Disneyland So I was psyched about that But they had us in these ridiculous costumes And basically filling in for professional dancers Because Coppola went way over budget On the epic that is Captain EO Yeah, so the final scene When Angelina I mean, Angelica Houston turns into a beautiful Angelica Houston All of us dance and celebrate And I'm dancing Horribly Ridiculously, I kind of look like Looks like if Jay Leno put the costume on I wouldn't put it past him Yeah, but people keep asking me Where I am when they're watching it on YouTube And it's so tiny that I don't know If it would be possible But on the big screen, I remember when we went to Disneyland together You pointed yourself out and it's very apparent Yeah, that's right. I pointed out with one hand While I was giving you a hand job with the other Well, come on now, Doug So much fun that day That's Doug Benson from Las Vegas Thank you so much for calling in, Doug

You can do anything If you believe You can do anything Unless you're a girl It really does make up for Michael Jackson's death that you were going to debut your song I'm trying to fill the void My feeling is that Maybe overfill it My feeling is that Michael Jackson held every celebrity's life essence in his body So now that he died every celebrity is slowly and much more rapidly now going to pass away as well Celebrity itself died Yes it did So like we saw about three or four deaths this week And it's just going to like almost like a plague It's just going to you know so I mean look for it I give you about three weeks honestly Because Michael Jackson was keeping you alive So that as soon as my tour is done Yeah you're just going to Hopefully you'll drop dead on stage like Dick Gregory did Oh wait no did he I don't know I may have my facts wrong That may be someone else I'm thinking of Let me welcome my next special guest into the theater Well I won't exactly say special guest But this is a guy Every day I go into this cafe in Toluca Lake where I live And I see a certain guy there every week And ever since I started the show he's really begged me to come on And I don't know I gave in this week And he needs money I told him I'd lend him money But he said no he wants to earn an honest living So let me introduce him this is Todd Wiki Hello Todd Hey man thank you so much for having me here Now you're going to tell us how to make an honest living Is that what you wanted to say Okay so here's what I need money Yeah what do you need money for Now Yeah now would be good So I need money to go or a ride But money mostly To go to the softball the fast pitch Softball semi finals in Shasta Okay I don't want to beg I don't believe in that And I was thinking how I could generate money And so I audited a class at the learning annex you know Okay And Now what do you mean by auditing a class I listened at the door And this class was talking about you should earn money About what you know in your life experience And so that's how I came up with the idea Okay now first of all you need to get to a fast pitch softball game Are you competing in the game Yeah Okay so you need to get there so What is your plan what did you learn I was going to take my sit down bike but the tires flat And I don't have any money for it Do you usually travel by stand up bike No it's bad for your legs Okay so what is your plan what did you learn Okay so I figure what I know about is how to tell people How to teach people to get workers comp for whatever job they're doing Okay how many jobs have you had over the years Oh okay I'm 46 and I've been working since I was 16 I have had 1009 jobs 1000 that seems like a lot It's a lot of jobs Even for 30 years of being in the workplace 1009 some more for a day some of them for less than a day How many of those did you get workers comp at I got workers comp at 980 jobs 980 so a little over half Yeah so it's what I know man I mean I It's a good gig you know I found something that works for me And that's getting hurt on the job and then not having to work anymore But still getting paid You alright there Yeah Okay I ate a day old scone on the way here I'm trying to lose weight so I'm not drinking any water Usually it's the opposite How did you come up with this idea Okay this is a good one okay so one time I was on a picnic with my step grandmother And she wanted to take a picture of me And so she had me sit on this fire fence And we had been eating brie so the fire fence was really slippery And I was sitting on it and I fell and I cracked my tailbone And I got out of school for two weeks And school was like work And I was like oh I got hurt So that I don't have to go to work That's where the idea came from Interesting so then you translated that as an adult into the workplace Yeah yeah yeah I also like I purposely One of my first jobs I was a pot washer And there was a show I wanted to go to And they were going to have me work And I didn't I don't like to work Do you remember what the show was Huh Do you remember what the show was Rat dog Rat dog The Grateful Dead spinoff group Yeah Yeah okay good I was going to go to the string cheese incident But those guys don't like me You know the Asian fiddler player from the string cheese incident Yeah I do very well he's a good friend of mine That guy beat the shit out of me at the Oregon Country Fair Okay But anyway so my first I was at this pot washing job And I spilled some hot potato water on my foot Okay And it looked a lot worse than it was Because I was wearing remember those Converse that used to go up to your knees No I don't but I'll take your word for it I used to have those and the hot water got in there And the but the acids in the potato water kind of negated the burn pain But it looked real peely So I got the weekend off I got some oh Some Vicodin and I got to go see Rat Dog And Bobby was on fire man he gets it He gets it he's like He really does He really does man Yeah He really found he really found his groove then That's a great story so so what do you do You usually start a job and then within three days you hurt yourself I suss it out Right Kind of figure out what the situation is Yeah between three to five days I'm usually pretty hurt Has word gotten around about you yet where people don't want to hire you or Oh no no no Because most of the businesses that I work at don't have phones Hmm okay so It's a fascinating story So what else do you do for money I mean you can't make just a living off of that No I uh I uh I come up with tattoo ideas for people Uh huh I don't draw but I talk about the ideas But you told me one other idea that you uh that you also do didn't you Dog bandanas Yeah now you share that with another friend of mine Oh yeah That gay guy that wears the safari shirt Yeah my friend who runs the bakery for dogs Oh I don't like that guy But you have the same idea Hey you know what about that stuff though Yeah Tastes just as good as regular food Alright well it's not we have to get out of this segment But I want to thank you so much for coming down Okay Hey um do you have a bus pass Not on me no usually I travel by car Alright Or stand up bike Oh it's really bad for your knees man Okay right Okay I gotta get out of here Alright well thank you This guy's working on my roller blades out in Venice I gotta go and check how he's doing Just keep track of him Alright Todd Wiki thank you so much for well thank you I guess for coming down Alright I'll see you at the cafe Alright this is uh Indie 103.1 comedy death ray We'll come back with the world debut of my song This is Neil Hamburger on Indie 103.1 Well it just ain't right at the end of the night When his personal life is

Hamburger from his country album Alright this is it the moment has arrived Amy I can't wait Okay this is the world premiere of my single Here let me explain a little bit we had Weird Al on the show two weeks ago And I got very inspired by what he was talking about About the immediacy of thinking up a song and then recording it and then putting it on the internet And so I got very excited yesterday as some of you know was my birthday And I went through something and I thought that it had to be told The story had to be told so I recorded the song last night And I'm releasing it to the internet and what he talked about was he recorded a version of Whatever You Like Which was number one on the charts at the time I'm doing something very similar So here it is this is the world premiere of Birthday Checks by Scott Aukerman Alright let's play it It's my birthday so you're all coming to my house Opening presents from my friends and my spouse Tear the wrapping paper then I start to cry out Bunch of things that I could have done without I said I want cash and don't think I got none These pants ain't my fashion someone pulled a fast one This sweater is itching I hate

It's a lot like the bakery for dogs theme You know my wife as I started to come to the studio right before I left She said you know you don't have to do that But so there we go you know I'm basically you know I was inspired by weird Al Weird Al is the best at what he does and I have to say that I'm the best at what I do Which is what he does You're the best weird Al imitator that there is So that's out there, it's out there now It's out there, there's no taking it back as it were I expect that it's going to be out there on the blogs, on the music blogs now There will be links to it now and you know Trending topic, I predict a trending topic I'm okay if people download it for free you know I'm alright with that That's a generous move on your part I know Amy you're against that I'm against it for me For you sure But for you For me it works I would say yes So feel free to disseminate that, feel free to spread it around But you know I just hope you enjoy it I enjoyed it thoroughly Thank you very much And I never, everyone else in this room felt exactly the way I did Alright well let's go to one more song and we'll have more with Amy Mann and Morgan Murphy After this, this is Don't Stop or We'll Die on Indie1031 Walking through Central Park In the rain In the rain Thinking about my baby Wishing things were still the same Do do do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do do Do do do do do do Do wah Do do do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do do do Do do do do do Do wah Went to your apartment But you moved The key Looked for you on the east side On the west side Statue of Liberty Sing it for me Do do do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do Do do do do do do Do do wah Do do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do Do do do do do do Do do wah Want to check my machine But I ain't got a dime to call All these problems so hard to ignore I wish I didn't live in 1984 Do, do do do, do, do, do, do, dodo, do, do...

there's more. Indie 1031, that's a beautiful song by Don't Stop or We'll Die, the comedy connection being that Paul Rust is the lead singer of that. His movie opens a week from today on the 10th. I Love You, Beth Cooper, he's the star of that movie, but the drummer is Harris Whittles, who writes for the Sarah Silverman program, and the keyboardist is Mike Cassidy, a very talented actor in his own right. This is Scott Ackerman, it's Comedy Death Right. I'm here with my co-host Amy Mann. What do you think of all of what's been going on?

I'm enjoying myself thoroughly. I'm still processing your musical debut.

I would assume that it's out there like wildfire by now. I mean, it's been three minutes since we debuted it, I assume that it's everywhere. It's probably been downloaded. Yeah. Hey Scott.

Sorry, I couldn't find my way out, man. Oh, hey, you're back. Hey man, Todd Wiki is back.

Is it cool if I stay? I missed my bus, so I got another 40 minutes. Oh yeah, just hang out. We're talking with comedian Morgan Murphy's here. He could carpool with us if that's...

Oh, that is so kind of you. No, he cannot. Why would you want for that? I'll put a blanket down. I brought in my own blanket in case I got a ride. Morgan, what are you doing on your hiatus? You're back here in LA. What do you do with all the time off? I mean, other than stand up, I'm trying to catch up on just really trashy daytime television. I realize that that's probably the thing I'm most about not having a job is just being able to...

Just being able to catch up. It's ridiculous. I mean, I don't know why I can't stop. I love...

You watched Tyra? You like Tyra? Sure. Like her? She doesn't have a forehead. She has a five head. That's why I like her. I don't know who somewhat ordained her, like My Generation's Oprah or something. No, I didn't do that, but apparently... No, you just have to do that on the internet. Oh really? They ordain you. Yeah. But she's great because she's just doesn't... She's like a very sort of bipolar kind of show. It's like Monday, brawn panties, Tuesday Darfur. She covers the whole... I'm going to watch Monday. Yeah. But no, I still...

I watch Maury. I feel like it's almost hackity to watch. Oh, Maury. I love the You're Not the Father episodes. They're great, whatever. But that's 90% of the show. Yeah. There was one episode and it was one of those like, oh, my kid's out of control. Help, television.

Help you, television genius. Can you help me? I have a parent and I don't know what to do.

Oh, TV. That seems like a good move. Turn to TV. Turn to TV. So this is all true. I swear this woman brings her kid... It's always by the way, it's always one woman. It's always a mom. It's never like a set of parents who are just like, God, we just did our darnedist.

It's one woman, she's in a methadone haze. She's like, I don't know what I did wrong.

You're like, you did everything wrong. Everything you've ever done, you did wrong, wrong, wrong.

I blame the absent father, but go ahead. Well, yeah, sure. I mean, but he's not there, so we can't talk to him. We can talk to the woman in the other room with the needle dangling out of her arm, wondering why her kid's coming home at 2 a.m. when she's 14. So they interview this 14 year old backstage for those out to commercial bumpers and she's against her brick wall so she looks real tough or like a comedian. Either or. Either or. And she's bragging about everything. They might as well have said, name the three things you're most proud of in your life. So she's like, I had sex with 100 guys. She can count to 100. This is good.

Off to a good start. And she goes, I had sex and my grandma walked in. Then she tops it off like knows the rule of threes. Don't know. Topps it off. Goes, I had sex for a cheeseburger.

Swear to God. Right. So Maury brings her out front to an audience of aggressive adults and and says, I think what we would all say in that situation, right, which is, oh, you had sex for a cheeseburger. We all would say that. That's exactly what we'd say. Did I hear what I just heard? Yeah. And she just says, she goes, yeah, cheeseburgers taste good. That is it. That is her ass. She's like 14 dead. I'm in my room pacing like, oh, this is the end of society. Our youth culture is spiraling out of control. I got to go volunteer in Africa. I'm not going to because I don't really mean it, but I'm thinking about it.

And then all of a sudden I had this like epiphany is it took me like 20 seconds, this realization of like, oh my God, I wish I had a reason as good as a cheeseburger for like half the guys I fucked. If only. She got something out of it, you know? Usually, you just get a good cry and a lifetime of regret. Yeah, a call to a BFF. Amy calling it back, an eye full of cum. And on that note, our show is over. I apologize on behalf of myself. I know a good out when I hear one. That's our show. It's been an extra supersized edition, but it's a holiday. Hey Todd, you all right, man? I'm okay, man. All right. Can you sign something for me saying I got hurt? I was working for you. You were not working for us, Todd. No.

That's been our show. It's been another great Friday. I want to thank my guests. Todd, what was your name? Wiki, Morgan Murphy, Doug Benson. I want to thank him and my cohost, Amy Mann.

Thank you so much. You can catch her on tour. Can you hear me? Cause I can't hear myself right now. We can hear you. Yes. Thank you. Next week, we have a Doug Benson will actually be here live in the studio. He's going to do the whole hour with us and my first repeat guest Rob Hubel will be here. Um, thanks very much. We'll see you next week. And this is a track eight, Amy from the Tim and Eric show. This is hearts. We'll see you next week.
