♫♫♫♫ ♫♫♫ Happy, I was gonna say New Year, but it's not even the new year for any of these episodes, but happy best ofs to you and many hamburgers to you.

Many hamburgers to you and to all of you out there.

Good night.

Good night. I'm saying goodbye to all my children.

Like it's an orchard.

And goodbye.

When you're on an orchard.

It was like goodbye. I'm never going to see you again.

Dear children.

You know what? I don't hate it.

It's not a bad bit.

I feel bad for the kids of course, but it would be really good.

People would talk about it forever.

Goodbye. I'm leaving your mother.

And then he never, never saw his kids again.

It's pretty funny.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

My name is Scott Ockermann and this is the best ofs 2022 edition.

Part one.

Can I tell you, and this is embarrassing, I thought your name was Don Ockermann until you just said Scott Ockermann.

So we've known each other for 28 years or so.

Yeah.

You thought it was Don this entire time.

Yeah, once your wedding?

Yeah.

Well, they were calling me Don at the wedding.

We fair.

I mean, we...

Yeah, why? Okay.

Now why was that?

Well, I'm not crazy.

Well, we got married on Christmas and they were saying Don, we now are gay, apparently.

They ever thought my name was Don.

Right, right, right.

And that I was gay and had a parallel.

Yes.

I remember and they were trying to stop the wedding.

Yeah, please stop the wedding.

Dustin Hoffman style.

These are references that men of our age may have.

That's the thing.

We are going to fuck around during these episodes.

Let me introduce my partner in crime here.

He's a criminal.

Yeah.

We can be crimes together.

Manslauter?

Yes.

We can be Manslauter together.

Yes.

Why do we kill?

What do we kill?

He is a stand up comedian.

He is a raccoon tour.

He is a writer.

He is a an improviser.

He is a writer.

He is a husband.

True.

And that's the list in order of what he likes.

That's my Twitter bio.

Yep.

Please welcome, he does this every year with me, Paul F.

Tompkins.

Hi, I do this every year with Scott and that's not alive.

No, we have lied several times so far.

Oh, how so far?

Look, here's the thing.

Scott can only tell lies.

I can also only tell lies.

So everything you're going to hear is the only truth.

Neither.

So when we said that that was true, it was a lie.

Yeah.

Everything is a lie so far.

We're lying.

Do you get it?

God damn.

Filthy liars.

You don't have to be filthy to be a liar.

That's true.

But in hell, he's a squeaky clean liar.

We have a good time when we do these.

If you've never heard these before, this is Paul F.

Ha-ha-ha-ha.

Paul F.

Tompkins is what happened there?

I found a little step stool under the table.

Oh, how cute.

I got some.

Someone, is there an exceptionally short host?

Is that for one of the office ladies?

Dereen Steinstamik?

Ahh, it's for one of the office ladies.

It's a red velvet stool.

That is Steve Carell's face.

Embroider done it.

But it's his character from Morning Show.

That's true.

Um, committing sexual harassment.

Yeah.

But then we liked him.

I guess.

And we felt bad when he drove off a cliff.

I felt bad for him.

I mean, look, all he did was sexually resume.

Maybe commit a rape.

And then, um...

Then he drove off a cliff.

Then he exiled himself to a beautiful Italian villa.

I felt bad for the guy.

Um, we are speaking of the step stool.

We are in the Earwolf Studios.

And we have some surprising news about our location.

We'll do in a future episode.

But, um, Paul, it is, of course, about a week before Christmas.

So approximately six days before Christmas.

And, uh...

Which is a holiday here in America.

That goose, guess what?

I mean...

Oof.

Getting a little large for my taste.

Oh, well, well, well, I...

Goose, go to see your doctor.

Take some, uh, Mozambic.

What is it?

What are they?

Mozambic?

I don't know.

A zempic?

Mozambic?

They're taking, like, diet pills?

It's like a Star Wars name.

But, let me...

It's not diet pills.

It's a...

It's a shot that you get.

But what?

Okay.

If you're fucking obscenely wealthy...

Yeah.

You can afford...

The best food.

Exercise.

Eat great food.

You can afford to hire an assassin to force you to exercise at a gunpoint.

Yes.

They make their own...

Which is what the only way I would do it.

Yeah.

They make their own fucking schedule.

There's zero excuse.

Yes.

And then a shot on top of that.

I know.

Well, it's, uh, it's also for something else.

Because I know it has a medical reason.

I think the added benefits is that people are losing weight on it.

But I can't remember what it's called.

It's like, well, butruin made people quit smoking.

So they also call it Chantix.

Really?

Same fucking thing.

Chantix and butruin?

Well butruin.

Yeah.

We've just run out of names for these drugs.

Butruin didn't work on people.

And then they were like, we gotta make this better.

And it became well butruin.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

I've been noticing, by the way, I see a lot of these drug commercials.

Oh, yeah.

And you know how every drug commercial, the template is, you see someone living the time of their life, living their best life.

And that is supposed to mean if you take this drug, you'll be able to do these things.

I've noticed a startling new trend in these.

This is exciting.

That the people who are supposedly having the best times of their lives are doing food service industry jobs.

There's one.

There's one where you see this woman and she's walking along the beach and you know in slow motion and she's gorgeous and she's having the time of her life.

And she walks right into a beachside restaurant and then starts host-a-sing.

Do you think it's aimed at Hallmark Channel viewers where the woman always has like a bakery?

Yeah.

It seemed like that although they did do one with a mail where like he's sad at the beginning of the commercial, he looks down at his phone and someone texts him, we miss you at the restaurant and he gets even sadder.

And then he takes this drug and then you see him like in the kitchen at the restaurant like frying up fish and stuff.

How did he not lose his job?

Was he the head chef?

He must own the restaurant.

Yeah.

I think what they're trying to do with these is like you can live your best life owning a restaurant.

But the poor woman who owns this restaurant, she's like delivering food.

She's like basically a food runner.

And then at one point you see her slightly picking at a big plate of food.

Food?

She's packing up a big plate of food.

I've had to say fruit and then I got confused with food.

I came out of fruit if not food.

I have fruit.

I have food.

Can you milk me?

I have food.

So she's like, oh, I'm not going to eat it.

So she's like, she's like fucking around with a pile of fruit, getting it exactly right aesthetically.

And then she just delivers it to a table.

It's not even like she's the person who creates the fruit and then then hires someone to take it to the table, which would be the dream, I would think.

She's a control freak.

Oh, so this is what it is.

This is her place, right?

Somebody else prepares the fruit and then she goes over and like they did it wrong again.

And then she hostesses because she can't trust anyone else to greet the people.

This is what it is.

So actually a drug's not helping her.

Maybe this is all the before, which is walking to the beach.

That's what she has.

She probably texted the drug and then zones out on the couch watching Netflix.

I really like the ones that I think are effective are the ones for psoriasis medication.

Oh, yeah.

Where it's people that are all bundled up like Eskimos, which is the season.

And then they take the drug and then they're like, I have no sleeves anymore.

I burned them.

You just see them, the whole Cogan style ripping them up.

I can't wait to get the pool.

I don't care if it's February.

Let me in there.

Is that whole Cogan who rips off his sleeves or is that because I saw a commercial the other day with the Gronk and he was ripping off the sleeves of his shirt.

I thought, I'll tour his t-shirt.

He tore it open.

You're right.

Yeah.

Did he?

I'm getting ready to see some racial epithets.

And I'm sick, so everyone's going to watch.

Sue someone.

Do you think that I would like to see the whole Cogan documentary or a biopic, I think?

You see the scenes of him like cutting slight little slits and he was scoring it with a razor blade so that he can dare to open more easily.

What if he couldn't do it?

If he was like pulling at it like, God damn, this is a strong suit.

Well made shirts.

I need to buy cheaper shirts.

Who would play him in the biopic?

This is a good question.

I mean, you know, normally you would go with a wrestler like a John Cena type, but can you imagine John Cena like with the handle bar mustache in the wig?

I can't actually.

I think it was funny.

It's very easy to imagine.

Who played him in the Weird Al movie?

There was a, he was a former wrestler or maybe a current wrestler.

Oh, the Weird Al movie starring both of us.

Yes.

Starring.

Yes.

I agreed to do the movie.

You know I'm off for only.

Yes.

Absolutely.

I, no, I did, I was offered the role after someone else got sick.

Oh, that's right.

But I did it on the, I'm off for only on the provision of health.

I did it on the condition that I, for that day, I beat number one on the call sheet and I refused to learn lines and I said, I'm just going to riff.

Wait, you were both of those lines?

Yeah.

And they were very plot forward.

Strangely enough, I just, I was so locked in.

I knew what the character was.

That was the first day of shooting and they'd rewrite a lot of the movie.

Yeah.

Wow.

Just for my riffs.

You really boomed him.

If you're listening to this, is this comedy bang bang?

Well, no, this is the best of comedy.

Is this what you'll hear when you listen to comedy bang bang?

Not really.

Absolutely not.

Never.

No, you're not listening to it now.

No, turn it off.

You can't hear this.

Normally the show is.

And normally for Garfield fans.

Normally, yes.

Normally it is a comedy program where I am the host Scott Ockerman.

We have celebrities usually on, although a lot of times we did not this year because we'll talk about the two distinct eras of the show this year.

Yes.

But celebrities due to health restrictions were not appearing on the show all that much this year until the back half of the year.

But normally in a normal episode you'll hear me talk to a celebrity for a little bit and then we will bring on other guests.

And the other guests are, and this is the big secret we only talk about on the best ofs.

And don't talk about this for the rest of the year.

Yeah, please only talk about it on the days we do the best ofs.

Yes.

On the days we release that.

That's when we acknowledge it.

I don't care when you're listening to this.

No.

If you're listening to it after it's released, you can't talk about it.

Yeah.

You're a traveler and you've taken it back in time, time cop style and you're listening to it on your Walkman in the 20s.

And then a time cop versus 20s.

That was the trailer to time cop I believe was like.

So we had a Walkman in the 20s.

And like someone like a big rich and powerful guy goes up a newfangled elevator into his office and it's all black and white and then he takes out a Walkman and starts playing metal.

And you can't do that.

You can't.

That's why the time cops stop you.

Time cops.

Yeah.

He can't play metal.

Yeah.

What if somebody hears it?

They lose their minds.

Exactly.

He'd be like, what is this slightly louder music?

Do you think that triggered the Great Depression?

Hearing metal.

Somebody heard metal and stopped the window.

He got confused.

Someone said it's metal music.

The economy was fine.

A guy jumped out the window and was like, must be the economy.

We're in a depression.

It's the economy stupid.

You said that first.

James Carvel.

Did he?

Yeah.

Carvel.

James Carvel did he.

Carvel did he.

The road used puff Carvel.

Carvel and Carvel.

Very similar.

One makes ice cream.

That's right.

And the other presumably eats it.

I bet he does.

Do you think if you made ice cream you would no longer eat it because he'd be like, oh that.

No.

I think I needed all the fucking time.

Yeah.

I think so too.

I think I'd learn how to make it very, very fast.

Yeah.

I'm hungry for ice cream.

It's like this.

I love this but it took too long.

I got to figure out a way to talk about time cop.

That's now I am.

I'm making ice cream.

Then I'm going back and I'm going forward in time to the ice cream.

How do I do my game?

I think that would be a marketing hook.

This is the ice like you see it on the shelves.

This is the fastest made ice cream possible.

Yes.

You're like, I don't care how it takes.

No, we made it really fast.

I just, but honestly the worst ice cream you've ever had still pretty good.

It's like pizza.

I know.

Did you ever make it when you were growing up?

No.

I never did.

We had an ice cream maker so.

I ate snow.

Is that count?

Yellow snow.

Scott.

Of course.

Of course you did.

It's flavored.

It's like a nice slushy.

You're in flavored slushy of course.

So what we do is we have celebrities on first and then we have comedians on and they are playing fake people that we interview.

That's the formula of the show.

Some call them characters.

A lot of people call them characters I refuse to.

Yeah, you always say fake people.

Right.

But yet I call them fake people.

They're fake people to me.

They're not characters.

They're fake people.

That is the format of the show.

We have usually a real person and then a bunch of fake people.

That's if you're listening to this.

That's what it is.

And Paul, because he is on the show so often, he does these best ofs with me.

And he sits there hoping that his clips get onto the best ofs.

Hoping and praying.

And you know, I turned my back on God a long time ago, but when we started doing these shows, I rediscovered prayer.

Yeah.

The power of prayer.

My prayer is about answered.

They have many times.

Do you think they'll be answered this year?

Did you want to be on the best ofs?

This is God's hands.

I did want to be on the best ofs this year, but if I'm not, that's God sending me a message.

What message is I'm done with you.

And so I will turn my back on him again.

Okay.

So we'll see.

Yeah.

This is a big tease for the episode.

We'll see if Paul turns his back on.

My prayers are all conditional.

Yes.

It's like, please God, let this happen or I will turn my back on you.

How do you think you did this year?

Do you think?

How do you think you'll be rising?

I think it's been a very good year.

It's been a lot of fun shows.

And I hope I'm in there at least once.

Yeah.

A lot of people are saying, Paul, I don't know how you feel about this because I know you're a listener.

You're not just a participant.

You also listen.

Yes.

That this is the best year in comedy, bang, bang history.

Really?

Herstory, sorry.

Themstory.

Okay.

They, themstory.

Are people really saying that?

A lot of people are saying it is, I mean, you know, a lot of people have fondness for the year that they first started listening.

That's what I've noticed.

Yes, sure.

The year they got into the show, they're like, that was the best year.

Yes.

But a lot of people are saying that somehow, I don't know what happened, but the show has catapulted into another stratosphere this year.

I mean, look, a lot of great guests.

It's been a lot of fun.

It's been very silly.

Some new blood coming in and reinvigorating the franchise.

Re-invigorating the saggy, bloated franchise.

This tired old workhorse has just had a fresh bag of oats.

Well, we said we would talk about it.

There were two distinct eras this year.

But actually, it's a little more like three because we, when we say it's the best of 2022 because of when we need to get all the votes in, we start post-Thanksgiving of the previous year.

That's right.

So there, we started in the last Monday of November, rather, of 2021 and we go through the, I think the third week of November of 2022.

So the three distinct eras were in 2021, we were still in the studio because mid-2021, the vaccines came out and everyone was kind of comfortable being in the studio again.

Then cut to 2022, come the new year, the COVID started kind of getting a resurgence.

It was like- Flash vouchy.

And it seemed cool again.

And so people were like, Hey, I kind of like this.

This thing.

So we had a good probably four months, I think, where we were taping all of the shows in the backyard.

Now, I had been taping them over Zoom during the first part of COVID because no one knew if it was even good to be in the backyard.

If you'll recall Paul, we were doing three of them episodes in the backyard.

Yes.

And we were doing them so far apart.

We were about 20, 25 feet away from each other using really long microphone cords and headphone cords.

Really funny.

We were super far away from each other.

And then the science got a little more locked down and people were like, Oh, no, if you're outside, even if you're close, there's very little chance of getting it, receiving it or giving it.

So we did a bunch of shows in the backyard for a good four months or so that where we were a little bit closer, we were kind of, but it was outside.

Yeah.

Now celebrities would not come to those shows usually because it's a little strange to say, Hey, come to my backyard and do a show.

It doesn't seem professional.

Now these would be people I would, I would imagine by and large people that have never done the show before.

Yeah.

And so they hear about this and they're like, what?

No, we did have some good celebrity.

We had David Cross and I'm trying to think of any other celebrity who came to this home.

Anders home.

Yeah.

This story.

Anders home came the wrong day he came the day before the show was supposed to tape and he was all excited and I said, you got the wrong day and he said, someone's getting fired for this.

And I said, well, I hope it's not me.

And turned out it was me.

Oh no.

I was fired for like two days.

Shit.

And then I called up Anders and I apologized.

Pronunciation.

Yes.

And he was like, all right, we'll hire you back.

So he get that power.

I don't know.

How did one man get all that power?

No, one man should have all that power.

Exactly.

So keep attributing that to Kanye, but it comes from Malcolm X.

Yeah, exactly.

But people think it's a qua, like he invented that.

He got it from Noah.

I remember Noah saying that.

And that's why he got rid of all the men.

After like when he was building the arc, he's like, this fucking sucks.

No one man should have all that power to make me do this.

And it was God.

He's got, yeah.

Yeah.

But yeah, Anders came one day.

It was the wrong day.

He came back the very next day when the show actually was scheduled.

So we had a few celebrities, but by and large, we did a few just all character episodes where people were just being characters.

And something about the energy of those was very relaxed.

I got to do a couple of those.

It was really fun.

It was nice.

It was fun.

So that was the backyard era.

And then come probably May around when the 13th anniversary episode came out, then we came back into the studio because things calmed down a bit.

Now maybe we go to the backyard again?

I don't know.

We'll talk about it a little later in the show.

We don't know.

Mm-hmm.

Whereas this is also has been the oh-no, the year of oh-no.

Right.

Where a lot of our guests said the phrase oh-no.

And what started that?

Well, we'll talk about that in the countdown.

I think I know.

A particular episode where it started.

I think that I know and I am going to, before when we get to it, I won't just say this is the one.

Okay.

And you'll say what it is.

Or you'll reveal any other information.

That there were two weeks in a row where everyone said oh-no.

And that's how it went on.

Yeah, every single person was on the show.

Ended up just saying oh-no.

In any case, so when we get to the first example of it, I will say this is the one.

Okay.

Paul, are you ready to get to it?

This is exciting.

One, very quickly, right before we dive in.

Yeah.

Earlier you said the phrase post-Thanksgiving.

And all I could think about was saying to you, what if I started a music career as post-Thanks giving and it was me singing but I have tattoos of turkeys all over my face.

And it was all I could think about while you were talking and I didn't hear anything you saw.

Okay, great.

And were you happy when you were thinking about this?

I was so happy.

To me, it's like if the Matrix were real, that's where I would be.

Yeah, instead of who you are right now.

Not even being post-Thanksgiving.

It is real and you're who you are.

But thinking about, yes, exactly.

Unfortunately.

Let me red pill you, by the way.

Who, please?

During the break.

I'm sorry, I remittisoned.

Okay, this is very exciting.

We're about to get to it.

Paul, are you ready?

Yeah, man.

We're doing a lot of episodes this year.

More, how many?

It was a very strong year.

We're going to do a top 17 this year.

Top 17, can you imagine?

I can't.

And I wish you told me that before.

I would not have agreed to do this.

Oh, really?

How many would you, can we, top 16?

You pushed it to 15.

And I was like, that's a lot.

If you had done top 16, I would have said, okay, but this is the last time.

Okay, but it's now at a top 17 without warning.

Yeah.

Well, I'm giving you the warning now.

So set your expectations.

Okay, goodbye.

Okay.

When you said post-Thanksgiving, I was thinking about post-Thanksgiving cereal.

What I said it to you.

Yeah.

Talking about when you said it to me.

Yeah, and that's all I was thinking about while you were talking about having a turkey tattoo.

This is a real O Henry.

So post- I mean, post-cereals are essentially raisin brand is the famous one, right?

Yes.

So if they did a Thanksgiving cereal, it would be cranberries with turkey flavored cereal.

Yeah, it would be cranberries with turkey flavored cereal.

Sounds good.

That sounds good to me.

And they have the cranberries on the box.

That's right.

Anthropomorphic cranberries?

Yeah, the band.

Oh, got it.

Yes.

Rest in peace.

That's right.

Delores O'Reardon.

Yes.

Zohombe.

All right, let's do it.

Here we go.

Wait, is Shirley Manson still alive?

Yeah.

From garbage, yeah.

Okay.

All right.

That was the name I was thinking of when I was trying to come up with Delores O'Reardon.

Yeah.

Well, there were contemporaries.

Stay alive, Shirley.

Please.

I don't want to curse.

We need you.

I will find you.

I have not seen that move.

Nor have I.

Oh, we should do it.

All right, here we go.

Let's do it.

Breaking into the comedy bang bang best of 22.

This is your choice for episode number 17.

Number one, seven.

All right, let's address the elephant in the room.

I thank you, Scott, because we have to talk about it.

We have to talk about it.

We have to teach the controversy.

Teach the controversy.

Okay, so we didn't rerecord the best of numbers.

No, as we have said, we were going to do it for the past four or five years?

10.

Probably.

Every year.

Okay, so I think the first year, 14 years ago, when we did the best ofs, I was looking for those cheesy little AM radio number countdowns.

I don't think they're cheesy.

They're elegant.

They are.

But I mean, they're from the 70s.

And so I found them online.

And I'm a 90s bitch.

I found them online.

And there were, it was only one through 10.

And we do more clips than that.

So we've had to say number one, seven, like you just heard.

And so every year we're like, we should rerecord these ourselves.

And then we asked people to remind us to do it this year.

This is the best part.

Yes.

And we said, we definitely will do this this year.

Yeah.

And to prove it, you need to remind us on this day.

And we set a day.

I think it was like, yeah, like in June or something.

I feel like it was in the middle of the tour or something because I just, we were looking at it in August, we looked down and this and were like, we're not going to do this.

And I had a baby on the way in a month as just like there's in fact, a lot of people on tour, I do recall this because Paul and I talked to fans in the pre show Q and A's.

A lot of people said, Hey, we just want to remind you to record the best of.

And I said, we definitely are going to do this in October, barring any sort of like huge life event happening to me.

But you knew this was happening in October.

So you had the tracking info on that, baby.

It was it was past label created.

This baby was on the way into shipping center in a woman's stomach.

So that was a little cheeky on my part, but we were sort of playing it off like a huge life event, like one of us dying or something.

But yeah, there was no way we were going to record this.

No, no, and we never will, except we will do it next year.

If you remind us every single day, every single day for the month of July, July, what do you want to say?

Yeah, July.

If if, if, and I'm not saying like one person, like, you know, Hey, Jim, Jim reminds us on July one and Andrea reminds, no, I'm saying like all of you have to remind us every day in July.

I don't know if anyone named Jim and Andrea has to do this.

Yes.

Thank you.

Jim's, Andrea's your task has been set.

So we will do it next year, definitely.

100% no lie.

This is a promise and a swear.

We will do it next year.

I kind of like the old numbers though.

They sound good.

I mean, you we can keep one to 10.

That's sure we could keep saying one to 10.

Who should we get involved in this?

Everybody you can sing that we know that we know.

Okay.

So who's this?

Connie?

Yeah.

Amy man.

Oh, oh, okay.

Beyond this comment bank.

Absolutely.

Bring them all in.

Nick Lowe.

All right.

Let's get to it.

This is number 17 and this is episode 774.

Can you imagine doing that many episodes of something?

No, it's too many.

We did even more than that.

Fuck.

Episode 774 from September 12, 2022.

My birthday.

Yes.

My birthday.

September what?

12th.

Oh, oh, oh, why?

It is it was your birthday that day.

That's right.

And we celebrated by putting out this episode.

They want a gift to me.

Yes.

What a gift.

This is an episode titled Inflection.

Mm.

Inflection.

I'm pronouncing that correctly, not inflection.

Inflection.

And this the participants are.

Can I say one?

Yeah.

Hammy.

It's Hammy time.

You can't touch this.

He should.

John Ham should as a commercial for one of his many commercials.

Yes.

He should definitely dress up in hammer pants and do the hammer dance.

What?

The fact that he hasn't done this is in a front door to us.

It's absurd.

I mean, if you were Amazon or Progressive or Apple or Mercedes or one of his companies, what are you sitting on your hands here?

He does Santa Claus for the World Cup before he does Hammy.

Hammy?

M.C.

Hammy?

Come on, man.

He does all these various campaigns.

So there's the one where he's in love with flow.

Yeah.

They should have spun him off and it was owned Progressive campaign.

He's doing his own thing.

There's M.C.

Hammy.

Yes.

He dress up.

Okay.

And this is you can't touch this deal on insurance.

He dresses up like M.C.

Hammy with flow just so we have the continuity.

Yes.

The torch is passed.

At the end flow says, I'm just not interested.

He walks off camera right.

Yes.

And cut to he walks on camera left and says, I'm going to be my own commercials from now on.

Yes.

So stay tuned.

We get like a little scenes from a marriage where he walks off the set.

And why did they do that?

I don't understand why they did that.

But he says stay tuned and then you have to leave your TV on.

Stay tuned.

Yeah.

You have to leave a tuned to the channel that you were just watching.

I don't think people say still they still say stay tuned.

Even though you don't tune your TV.

So you know what's funny is that people still address podcast listeners as viewers.

I had trouble with that because I was used to saying it on TV and I had to every I would go view.

I mean, listeners.

Yeah.

It's very, very difficult.

I'm talking about people who have never been on TV are saying viewers.

Yeah.

Our viewers will want to know this.

Like, what are you fucking talking about?

Although maybe you're listening to something that occasionally has a video feed.

I'm talking about like the news.

You're listening to the news.

I'm listening to the news.

What news?

The Northeast West and South news, my dear boy.

Oh, that news.

Yes.

All right.

So John Ham is an old friend of ours.

I've known him.

Gosh, probably for two years before he was on Mad Men, we used to play poker together over at his place and he was always the very talented actor who could never get a break could never catch a break.

That's right.

Was always.

I poker at poker.

Worst actor.

He was a guy who he would get cast in pilots and they would never go.

And he would have like bit parts in shows like the unit.

I don't know if you remember the unit.

David Mamet, I believe co-created that as well as Sean Ryan from The Shield.

Oh, no, thank you.

It was pretty good.

He would be on like three episodes and we go, hey, you were great, John.

And we go, oh, when is he ever going to get a show?

And then one day he said, oh, I'm on this show on AMC and we went the movie channel.

Get the fuck out of here.

Fool.

You fuck it, idiot.

And we kicked him out of his his own apartment.

Wow.

What the fudge?

Can you imagine?

That's rude.

And then I remember we were playing poker at his place and I was like, I hear your show is pretty good.

And he's like, oh, let me give you some videotapes.

It was still videotapes.

Boy, you're yoying.

What?

No, maybe it was DVDs.

He wouldn't.

Yeah.

And then he would be videotapes because I remember it being very chunked in probably DVDs.

Yeah, of course.

Yeah.

And then she was on the 2000s.

I had requested they give me VHSes.

I just remember it being a clunky package and him like giving me season one and it just took up a lot of space.

But maybe it was DVDs.

Maybe I think it probably was.

Yeah.

Anyway, he gave me the DVDs and.

He gave you a hard drive.

He gave me a computer.

That's nice.

That's very nice.

He must have been doing very well.

But the rest is history, of course.

I watched those DVDs and the show became famous.

Don't want to make a connection, but you're free to do so.

In any case, he's been doing this show Comedy Bae Meg since the beginning, since the very first year.

Always a great friend of the show.

He had a movie come out in September called Fletch, which is why the title of the show is In Fletchian.

I believe we even say it in this clip that we're going to listen to.

Oh, OK.

The other participants are we're not going to hear from him in this clip, a Devin Field, the very funny Devin Field, who has started doing the show this year ever since the Speed Force skanksgiving special.

Skanksgiving?

Skanksgiving.

Is that what it was called?

Yes.

Of last year, I hadn't met him and Sean Diston cast him as someone who is going to be important to the show in the future, which then made me say, well, we needed to come true.

So I started using him.

He's very funny.

We're not going to hear from him, but we are going to hear from Lily Sullivan.

Can I just take this moment to give a shout out to Lily Sullivan?

Paul, it is time to do that.

She's so funny.

You've done it too early in previous best of us.

I know right on time at this point.

I know.

I'm so glad.

Lily Sullivan, she's very, very funny.

She's been doing the show for, I don't know, three, four years at this point, something like that.

My wife and I recently had not really an argument, but we were each claiming.

Throwing pots and pans at each other.

Well, that's just the thing we do because we hit our neighbors.

So we take as much noise as possible, trying to scare them away.

Every time we see them on the stream, we're like, our house is haunted.

Pretty haunted.

I think they talked about hunting other houses in the neighborhood.

But we had a little disagreement about who was the bigger fan.

I was saying I was.

She was saying she was.

On the Rock'n'roll Hall of Fame, I believe Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, one of them, the one who talks more, said, we've never had an argument because I don't want to win anything that he would lose.

We've had disagreements.

Wow.

Yeah.

I thought that was love.

Yeah.

I thought it was an interesting thing to say.

Are they still married?

I believe they are.

I don't think I remember when Morris Day officiated on stage at a time show.

They didn't know they were getting married.

And after it was like, hi, I married you.

Okay.

So Lily Sullivan, a very funny comedian, she does a ton of characters on this show.

And the one you're going to hear is Bridget Jones.

Now, she started doing Bridget Jones when we were on tour.

Gave you.

We did a lot of dates in August of this year.

And Lily did approximately four or five of the dates.

And she did Bridget Jones on tour.

And this is the first episode she did in the studio with Bridget Jones.

And this is, of course, her doing the real Bridget Jones that the movies are based on.

And may I say, this is the most recent time, but it's also, as of now, the last time that she's ever, she will do Bridget Jones.

Yes, that's right.

Yes, she will never do.

She may do it again.

I don't know.

But as of right now, it's the last time she'll ever do it.

That's true.

We may change our minds.

But yeah.

So we're going to hear this clip.

This is John Hamm and Lily Sullivan as Bridget Jones.

This is your number 17.

Number one, seven.

She's a famous diarist.

Please welcome to the show, Bridget Jones.

What's up?

How are you doing?

I'm good.

Hey, Bridget, this is John.

Hi.

Nice to meet you.

How are you doing?

Listen, you guys got it.

Mad wrong.

It's not a diarist.

It's diarrhea.

Oh, it is diarrhea.

That is what you call me, OK?

So let's get straight straight out the gate.

Wait, is everyone?

It's weirdly as how diarrhea comes.

Straight out the gate.

Has everyone been mispronouncing the movie titles?

Is it Bridget Jones Diarrhea?

Bridget Jones is Diarrhea.

OK.

Wow.

To be fair, I never saw any of the movies, nor did I read the diarrhea.

I saw that first one.

I don't remember any of these scenes where Bridget Jones had, excuse me, had to go.

But listen, you got it mad wrong.

Hollywood took that story.

My Diarrhea from way back when.

And they changed the shit a lot.

So they messed up.

OK.

That's right.

Now, you and I met on tour.

We met on tour.

This is in Boston, is that right?

No, we met in New York.

You were in New York?

Oh, OK.

Yeah.

The city of lights.

City of.

The city that doesn't sleep.

The city with the trash everywhere.

The city is so nice they named it twice.

They did.

New York.

That city, that's so nice they named it twice.

They named it twice.

New York.

We met there, and you, we talked a little bit there about what did we talk about?

Well, so basically, like 23 years ago or whatever, as they bought me Diarrhea off me, the Hollywood people, no offense or whatever.

Oh, no, it's not a taken.

Is this Weinstein?

I don't remember who was, whatever, but I know.

You'd remember who was Weinstein, for sure.

And your plants would remember.

I'll tell you that.

That's right.

Really say.

So you know who he is.

That's today.

Talking about Anne Frank and now this.

Right when I get on.

It's Woody Allen.

Don't forget it.

Should we talk about Michael Jackson?

Hold it.

I mean, it's right there.

So listen, baby, buy my Diarrhea off me for nothing.

Like 35 quid or something.

Like that.

Whoa.

Nothing.

I'm like, yeah, should I take this?

How much is a quid?

I don't know.

Because I know you can get one for every quo.

Yeah.

It sounds like it's $4.

Because of quads.

Quid quads.

I don't know.

Yeah, I don't know.

I don't know what the exchange rate is.

Regardless, it's relatively low.

It was super low.

It was like $4.

Like $4.

35 cents.

So it's like a quarter, yeah.

Like a quarter quads.

Absolutely nothing.

Quads.

And I'd be like, OK, well, yeah.

Like, go ahead and take it.

Then they go make this big movies with Zalwiggas Reneez and Cullen and Hug and Grunk.

Hugh Grant, I believe, is that right?

Yeah, yeah.

You don't really hit that first G.

Hug and Grunt.

Famous lover of blowjobs.

Hugh Grant.

He's so good.

He's on record as loving him.

Really?

Don't always say.

He's like, I love it.

It's like my favorite thing in the world.

I believe that's his quote.

That sounds like that.

That's the fruits in the pudding.

I mean, if I can bring it back to diarrhea, the fruits in the pudding.

Look, we all love blowjobs, probably.

Probably.

You never have one.

You don't know.

Bridget.

What?

You want me to keep talking?

Yeah, what do you do?

OK.

Yeah, so they buy me diarrhea for me for literally nothing.

Then they go, they make this big movie.

They make all this money.

I'm like, what the shit?

So I didn't get any of that.

I'm so sorry.

I'm like, I'm going to go back to a drawing board, work on me diarrhea, then sell it, make lots of money.

Yeah, because they bought the old diarrhea.

Yeah, they can't die.

They can die every day, right?

Right.

Yeah, I'm like, so I'll work on me diarrhea.

And then now, 23 years later, I'm basically done with the shit.

So I'm ready to make a new movie.

Right.

Took me that long, but I got some entries.

I got like six or sevens entries, like, Mac entries.

Will this be starring you?

Will you actually get to star in your own story?

Well, this is what the thing is.

Like, I'm like 55.

Like, but I want to tell like a young story.

So I'm fine with like a young hot bitch playing me, you know what I mean?

Yeah, I mean, Bridget, here, you're 55.

You're kind of, I mean, like a butter face.

And so, you know, it's not like you have.

Don't give me style with this shit again.

It's not like looking at you.

I forget your face immediately.

It's like, you know what you look like?

What's that?

You remind me of like a gyoza.

A gyoza?

A dumpling?

Yeah, you're like fried and like full of meat.

Interesting.

And like, you're super not hot, like a cold one.

Hmm, interesting.

OK.

What?

That's what you look like.

What's that?

So don't call me a butter face.

Like, I know I'm mad hot.

Is it, what do you call a butter face in England?

Does it call something different?

Smear.

Just a smear.

Smear like a smear.

So you want someone who's a little bit younger to start in the movie?

Yeah, like, I want the movie to sell or whatever.

I want to make mad money.

Like, I'm not stupid.

Like, put the fucking hot bitch in.

Right.

Like, who?

Like, today's Renee Zellweger.

Yeah, who would that be?

I don't even know.

Well, so like, I got an entry about it.

Action culture?

Yeah, action culture.

Probably.

Action culture.

You have an entry, though, you say?

Yeah, I have entry I can share with you.

Because I want to try and get a word out.

A taste of what the story might be.

And then maybe we can cast it.

Well, because Johnny here.

I know some people.

You can do an English accent, can't you?

Oh, yeah, certainly.

Wait, is that it?

I can certainly try to do one.

Yeah, right.

That's mad good.

That's waffle.

Yeah.

That's mental.

You sound exactly like me, dad.

That's how great.

Bridge.

Let's read it.

It's a mental.

That's absolutely mental.

OK, let me read my diary entry.

OK, OK, here we go.

This is Bridget Jones.

A recent diary entry or something from the past 20 seconds?

Reset.

I'm in LA.

Like, I'm taking in the city, like going to Target, going to like Home Depot.

All the other other spots.

All the places right off Sunset.

I'm going to Yolgudland.

I'm going to GameStop.

Things you just saw.

I'm going to.

Wow.

What's that burrito place?

I'm going to Netflix offices.

OK.

Yeah, so like I'm taking in the city.

You know what I mean?

So here we go.

OK.

Did I write?

It's me, Bridget Jones from Bridget Jones' diary.

It was a typical Hollywood morning.

Woke up to the sounds of people's assholes being bleached.

Put on me stompers and headed out for a bit of brachy.

Ordered myself a cup of jiggy jeans and a plate of squally squog.

When all of a sudden, Inwok's famous Hollywood girl, Alison Williams.

I knew this would be my moment.

So I got him.

So I told him.

I told her all about me diary idea and insisted that she play me since I know that everybody wanted Tiggy her wiggy and poppy her dog.

But then out of nowhere, she'd be yelling at me to get away.

Something about me asking too many questions about her not.

But then it hit me.

Clearly, she was intimidated by me and me diary and scared I was coming for all of her quid and quill.

But then again, who wouldn't be?

Love Bridge.

OK.

A lot of potential there.

I mean, so this is going to be a movie about your character going up to Alison Williams.

No.

You didn't do a fight?

I think I was listening.

No, you've been like mid-centering modern furniture right now.

You're a pointy.

You don't make sense.

OK.

All right.

I accept that criticism.

No sense.

Right.

But I mean, that's one of the set pieces in the movie.

Is it big?

No.

Listen, I'm trying to approach her, have her play me.

She's hard to shit.

You know?

Sure.

She's a good singing voice.

Yeah.

She played Peter Pan.

Pretty thing.

Peter Pan.

Yeah.

Like, that's me.

Yeah.

Like, I look like the event.

Like, she could mad nail me.

You know what I mean?

But didn't you say that the movie was going to be based on these diary entries?

Just don't do anything to us.

So Alison Williams would then in this scene.

He'd play you.

And then who would be playing Alison Williams?

Brian Williams.

I think she goes up to her dad and then a real alter-case.

Can I put this wig on?

I'd be honored to get Brian Williams.

Do you think we can get him?

Beatups?

Do you think he retired just for this, maybe?

He might.

He would do it.

He likes.

He loves.

He loves nothing more than a challenge.

He loves a camera on him.

He would play young me.

Alison would play old me.

Right.

We'd have this conversation in the Lily Gones circles.

But I'd love to hear more of your entries.

Do you have more?

I've got more entries for you.

You're like begging for him.

You're like fucking horny for him.

I'll give him to you, I guess.

I'm horny for you.

Literally like freaking out.

He wanted him so bad.

OK.

Did I, yeah.

It's me, Bridget Jones from Bridget Jones's Diary Out, which is going to be a script someday.

It was a typical Hollywood afternoon.

Walked down the street to the sounds of plastic surgeons, breaking people's noses, popped in a shopper, bit of lunch, and ordered me self a massive slimy, blind me, topped with stinky snappies.

When all of a sudden, in Mark's famous Hollywood person, Billy Ray Cyrus.

Whoa, wow.

I knew this was going to be my moment.

So I tell him all about me diary movie and ask if he want to play me love interest, because I know everyone wants to arm teeth.

Arm teeth is pretty good.

Pog.

Then, out of nowhere, he says he's going to throw me out on me cheeky donka.

Something about all the pictures I drew on the iPad have been exposing his fruit basket to Miley.

Then it hit me.

Clearly, this man was intimidated by me and my diary.

And scared I was coming for all of his luck.

It's filled with pictures of dead people in him.

What?

Is that how he keeps his riches?

Then again, who wouldn't love Bridge?

OK.

Interesting.

What's that face?

So this whole movie is just you accosting, like, F-list celebrities?

It's me making my movie.

Like, think about all the movies about making movies.

Like the recent Downton Abbey movie.

No, like, literally.

Which is just insane.

That they're making a movie, a talking in Downton Abbey.

And the butler starts writing the script.

I didn't know any of this.

This is my case.

Yeah, make sure you don't have too much crossover with that.

17.

I was wondering though, Bridget, very big news out of the empire today.

I don't know if you can't talk.

Oh, yeah.

We may be covering that on a future show.

Oh, really?

We can certainly not talk about it if you don't want to.

Yeah, but are you gutted?

On that gut.

Like, I can't believe it.

She was so young.

For a very old woman.

She was so young.

She was a young 96.

I couldn't believe it when they said she was sick.

I was like, you can't be kidding me.

That's insane.

That couldn't be true.

I'm so sorry.

Here, let's take your mind off this.

Let's read another interview.

Oh, I know you're mad horny about it.

I don't know about you, horny.

OK, here we go.

Dead eye-round.

It's me, Bridget Jones from Bridget Jones' diary, the movie, to be.

It was a typical Hollywood night.

Called me an Uber to the sounds of actors crying.

Snuck the bevy and ordered me self a happy baby.

We decided to me younger.

We knock them aside in Inwog's a famous Hollywood robot, Liam Michelle.

What?

I knew this was my moment.

So I tell her that there's some outlets over there so she can charge herself to 100%.

Get back to not reading.

We're all of a sudden, Inwog's Ellen from Ellen.

I ask her if she wants to play me mom and me diary movie, since I know everyone wants to dunk in donuts or guinea pigs.

And then, out of nowhere, she'd be saying she's going to slice me noggy with a DVD, the da Vinci code, because I looked at her in the eyeballs.

Then it hit me.

Clearly, this woman was intimidated by me and thinks that I'm coming for a princess Diana and the Beanie Babies.

Then again, who wouldn't love Bridge?

OK.

So there's a lot happening in that one.

Yeah, this is a double celeb.

That was a big one.

Liam Michelle and Ellen.

Liam Michelle was like the misdirect.

And Ellen comes in and cleans up.

Yeah, see, Ellen, she knew Liam Michelle was there.

They're friends.

Well, Bridget, this is, I don't know if this, any of this makes a good movie, but.

Wait, no, I'm into it.

Here's what I'm thinking.

I'm thinking seven episodes right to streaming and keep it as almost a reality show.

Yes.

Because I want to see these interactions between these.

Let's call them marginally famous people.

Yeah.

And Bridget Jones.

And then I want to see how they interact.

Oh, up and down Sunset Boulevard.

I feel like I'm open to it.

If you can get me mad meetings, I'm down for whatever.

I don't want to be stuck here looking like Scott, you know?

I don't want to be like a plate of empty Tupperware.

Like, oh, stinky.

Wait, I got to write me another entry.

You're writing one right now?

I'm writing one right now.

You're inspiring me, Scott.

All right.

I'm like, oh, gosh, this is coming out of me.

It's pouring out of me.

You want me to read it?

Oh, yeah.

Well, you're writing it.

That's your right, please.

Yeah, please.

Dear Daira, it's me, Bridget Jones from Comedy Bang Bang.

It was you can say that you're from comedy.

Well, she's here right now.

So I was on one episode of the Jimmy Kimmel show.

I wouldn't say Scott, I'm from the Jimmy Kimmel show.

I wouldn't correct you.

From my podcast, Comedy Bang Bang.

It was a typical ear wolf afternoon, dragged me off a massive bottle of water, and then wrote me name on the table with a drying sharpie.

When all of a sudden, in what a not famous, tiny, angry baby man, Scott Ockerman.

I knew this was going to be my moment.

So I called me manager to tell him that if I die here today because Scott kills me, to give me ashes, to Tom Cruise, can so he can spread him over the mountains in his tiny plane.

But then it hit me.

Clearly Scott Ockerman was intimidated by me and thinks I'm coming for his hand tie.

Hey, now this hand tie thing.

Not pretty.

I don't know how this got started.

What are you talking about?

I don't know how this rumor got started that I'm into hand tie.

You love hand tie.

I don't know.

I saw all your likes on Twitter, like every single like hand tie hand tie hand tie hand tie hand.

And then once sure, I accidentally just tweeted hand tie gifts.

Yeah.

Because I was searching for it.

I do it in a good pace.

Exactly.

Yeah, like in my success.

What?

I don't know, Bridget.

I'm not going.

I don't think this would make a good movie as my main.

Yes, I'm personally insulted by that last entry, but I just don't know that this is.

Are you not entertained?

Aren't you mad horny for every entry?

Yes, but John, you want to be attached to this movie?

I don't want to be attached to it at all.

I don't want to be in the same room with it, really.

But I would say that there is a place on like a, like not peacock, but like peacock minus.

Yeah.

See so like something like that.

See so, if you see so things, say so things.

Yeah.

Like negative paramount.

Yeah, pegative.

Did you hear?

Fair paramount minus.

In Mad Men, did you ever call peg pegative?

Pecative.

Accidentally.

Hey, pegative.

Yeah, that's what the money is for.

You're being pegative.

Number one, seven.

Mm-mm.

Oh, what a clip.

That kind of clip to me is what clips are all about.

Yeah, it's like a portion of the show instead of the whole show.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's what clips are all about to me.

It really gets to the heart of what clips should be.

Man, if I was listening to a clip show and they just played the entire episode.

I'd say you got this is not a clip show.

This is not a clip show, my man.

My brother in Christ.

Let's talk about a few things.

Hentai is mentioned.

This is.

Let's talk about why this started.

That started on tour, right?

It started on tour in North Carolina.

Is that where we were?

Maybe.

Where Kono and Brian showed up.

I just remember for all the tour, I remember we were in city.

I had to keep track of them because I would say absolutely whatever city it is.

Yes!

No, I believe we were in North Carolina and Tim Balts was there.

Mm-hmm.

Lily's husband Tim Balts, who people would know from the righteous gemstones.

You would also know Lily from the righteous gemstone.

She plays Tim's sister, I believe.

That's right.

And he was there doing the one episode that he could get away from the righteous.

He was filming at this time in North Carolina was relatively close to where he was filming.

Yes.

So he was able to drive in.

He was there and I said Hentai is a reference not knowing what it was and praying that because a lot of times when I throw out a reference, I'm like, am I getting this right?

Sure.

And 50% of the time, I'm not.

Well.

I like those hot.

Yeah, Nate.

But I threw it out and I forget what I was referencing, but I was sitting there going, I hope this is like an anime porn thing.

And from what I understand, it's also a tentacle porn thing.

Is that right?

That's what I understand it to be.

And of course, I think we even got into this on the tour, not maybe not on stage, but backstage.

There was a journalist who posted a screen, he posted a picture and you could see his computer tabs.

And it was all one that was like Hentai.

And he's like, Oh yeah, I was researching my wife had never, she never, she didn't know what that was.

And I was showing her what it was.

So great.

Yeah.

And of course, there's the classic porn gifts, which is one of the best tweets of all time.

And somebody said he never took it down.

He never deleted it.

Hey, I wouldn't.

I respect that.

I wouldn't, I wouldn't.

I'm proud to start for porn gifts.

Well, so I mentioned it as a reference, just hoping I was making a funny reference to something Lily and Tim capitalized on it.

And now Lily cannot be on an episode where she doesn't mention it.

I suppose it anti it.

Very true.

Yeah.

She also, I was eating a salad backstage and she got on stage and talked about how I was eating something that looked like shit.

Yes.

And it was, and people are like, well, he must have been eating something disgusting.

It was a salad.

She just, she made all that up and said I was.

Wait, did people were questioning like, what could he have been eating?

What could he have been eating that was so disgusting that Lily's making his weird character to say that?

No, just eating his salad.

Just eating a salad.

Let the man live.

Let me be.

I just want to be my salad.

What do you mean, God damn salad?

Paul, here's a tease.

Fuck.

Here's a tease for a future episode.

Okay.

Now that episode that we just listened to, that clip clip, there was a certain comedy bang bang fan listening to that episode at home that had a very particular reaction to it.

And we will be talking to them in the new year.

Very particular.

Liam Neeson.

Yes.

Yeah.

He was taken.

But he's like, okay, this is happening.

Take it to the rapture.

Yeah.

His keys and shoes are there.

It's keys of shoes.

Don't need no shoes in heaven.

Boy, that's true.

Yeah.

I like that there are people in the rapture who, people who believe in the rapture who are, there's two different camps.

They're the people who think that all of your earthly possessions will stay, but your body just leaves.

Right.

So there's like a pile of clothes.

A pile of clothes and you're watching everything.

And then there are people who are like, no, everything disappears.

Everything is stupid.

Exactly.

It should just be like, no, your dead body stays and your soul goes.

Yes, of course.

Anyway.

So what are they nude?

Everyone's nude in heaven?

I guess so.

That sounds like heaven to me.

Oh, boy.

Well, that was, that's exciting to hear that a tease for a future episode, isn't it?

So all of you comedy, bang, bang, detectives get out, get out your magnifying glasses, and podcast magnifying glasses.

One might say greeting, greetings, gumshoes.

That's true.

All right.

We're going to take a break, Paul.

Okay.

And it's your show.

Yep.

And when we come back, we're going to be still counting down these episodes.

You believe we're still going to be doing it.

We're going to still be doing it.

All right.

We'll be right back with more comedy, bang, bang after this.

Yay.

Jimmy.

We're back.

Coming back back.

That's 2022.

That's true.

That's a good point.

Did that make you mad that I brought us back from the break?

I did.

Because that's my bailiwick.

Did you feel cucked?

I did.

Well, also you were having sex with my wife while you did.

Yeah.

Welcome back, Scott Ockerman here.

We're here with Paul F. Tompkins.

And we're counting down your choices for the top 17 this year.

And we're happy to do it.

We're happy.

I mean, I'm happy to do it.

I'm happy to do it.

Paul's a little annoyed.

We're doing 17.

No, I was joking.

He was joking.

He loved it.

I love it.

Why don't we get to, you know what comes after 17, right?

18.

Yeah, but instead we're going to go the other way.

What?

We started at 17 and went all the way up to 52 and never got to the best episodes.

All right.

Let's do it.

This is your choice for episode 16.

Number one, six.

All right.

Episode 16, Paul.

Last number 17, we had 774.

So we're in the latter part of the 700s.

So this is episode 707D.

Okay.

So this is before.

Four weeks before.

And that last one you said was September 12th.

So this is subtract four from that.

So September 8th.

Good math.

This is August 15 of 2020.

Wow.

The Ides of August.

We were on tour while this was released.

We were out there entertaining America.

So we must have taped it before.

Anything could have happened.

Like we weren't here to monitor the situation.

That's true.

And this is what happened.

Yeah, it's a good episode.

It's like, we shouldn't be here more often.

We shouldn't be here.

Yeah.

It checks out.

I'd love to meet you here less often.

Come here never.

What were you going to say about Gremlins?

I don't know, but I was going to say something.

You were going to say something.

The idea that we were that the episode was we were away from the episode.

So anything could have happened.

Yes.

The Gremlins went nuts.

Oh my God.

That was the thing about Gremlins though.

I noticed in those two movies they didn't give a shit of people were around or not.

They were just really gremlins going to be gremlins.

They weren't they worried that they would be hunted to extinction?

I know you would think so.

And they were in both movies.

They died in both movies.

I don't remember gremlins too.

I don't remember it, but I don't remember it.

It is a good subplot.

I think it's in Grem.

We just watched it for my sister show, Scott SNC.

Which I listened to.

It's just a crazy movie.

It's crazy.

It's good though.

It is a good subplot of like, hey, all of the bad gremlins come from this really nice one, Gizmo.

We need to execute Gizmo.

It's a good subplot.

All right.

This is episode 770.

The title of this poll is called She Garbage People.

Oh, this is vaguely.

I mean, I recognize that title.

I could not tell you what happened and I'm pretty sure I was there.

I believe you were there.

Who do you think was the based on the title?

Who do you think the celebrity was?

Who was in this?

I think it was Tatiana Maslini.

It truly was.

That's right.

She Hulk herself.

Tatiana Maslani.

She is in this episode.

This is another studio episode, two studio episodes.

The celebrities were back indeed.

That's right.

Tatiana is another friend of ours.

She graduated from fan to friend.

She graduated.

She was promoted.

She used to be a fan of the show.

She used to, when she was filming Orphan Black, she used to listen to the show while biking to and from set.

She and Christian Bruin, her co-star on Orphan Black, they both bonded over their enjoyment of the show.

And then she, I forget how, oh yeah, that's right.

She reached out because I knew her publicist and wanted to come to a live show when she was at Comic Con for Orphan Black.

And so she- Well, we met her.

That's the first time, right?

Yes.

I don't know if you were there, though.

I met her at Comic Con, at a Comic Con event.

You know what?

It was for- Are you sure?

It was Derek Waters, Taryn and- JW Stillwater?

Yes, I was there.

You were there?

Yes, I was.

Holy shit.

You were really late.

You were coming from another show.

I was coming from another show.

Oh, coming from another show.

Okay, yeah, you were super late.

And by the way, you know who opened for that show?

Aquafina.

Doing her rap.

What?

Doing her raps.

For your show?

Yeah.

How many bang bang?

Yeah.

This is, I mean, quite a few years ago, this is seven years ago, eight years ago?

It was Aquafina.

Wait, do you mean Nora from Queens?

Yes, Nora.

I- Yes, that show, I think I was doing a thrilling adventure hour show.

Ah.

And I was coming from that.

That's right.

Okay, so Derek and Taryn were coming from the dinner.

That's right.

And they were kind of late.

They were texting me kind of going like, hey, we're late, we're trying to leave, we're trying to leave.

Anyway, so that- But in any case- Wait, I think I got there before them.

Yeah.

So, not only was I there, I was also on time.

You're always there though.

Always on time.

Shanti.

Did Shanti have a song about punctuality?

What if you didn't know who Shanti was?

You thought it was just like my catchphrase.

Shanti.

Like my chazam.

Are you turning into a creature?

Shanti is just as stupid as shazam, the name.

All names are stupid.

Yes.

Okay, so in any way, in any way, Tatiana and Christian came to the comedy bang bang live show in San Diego dressed as Ninja Turtles.

Yes.

Thinking they had to be disguised, otherwise they would be mobbed by fans.

They were told by the real closest.

Because when they would walk around Comic Con, yes, they were mobbed by fans.

But this was a show that was approximately four or five miles away from Comic Con.

Yeah, this was an off site.

And no one cared that they were Ninja Turtles.

But we have very funny pictures of them.

If anything, people, I think, avoided them like the play.

Yes.

We have very funny pictures of them dressed as Ninja Turtles posing in Ninja Turtles poses backstage in an alley when we met them.

So that was where we met.

And they've both have done the show over the years and they're great people, great friends.

They're absolutely lovely people.

I have a picture on my office wall of me with them when we met for the first time.

I mean, it makes me very happy when I see it.

Yeah.

You know, we should, as humans, take more pictures of when we meet someone for the first time.

Because they could be our great friends.

Could be your greatest enemy and what a picture to have.

I'm sure.

I was like, see this guy, I hate him.

This reminds me, I meant to bring this up earlier.

You were singing How Bazaar, How Bazaar.

How Bazaar.

By OMC.

And I was like, man, whatever happened to OMC.

Orchestral maneuvers in the car.

But shouldn't I was like, damn, it sucks that they were a one hit wonder.

I think all one hit wonders, one hit wonder song should be done by one band.

The same band.

Okay.

What?

You know, it's so bad that like these, these poor bands, they only get to have one hit.

Yeah.

Let's make all the one hit wonder songs done by one band.

So they have a lot of hits.

So is this new band, are they covering all of these songs?

They're not covering.

They just, they write them all.

Okay.

And then various people record them?

No, they record them so that they get to have all these hits instead of these poor bands that only get to them.

So this is, you're saying going forward.

Yes.

This is what we should do.

Is anoint a band to be our one hit wonder band.

To have nothing but hits.

Yes.

This is a great idea.

Look, I, this man doesn't even exist yet.

I mean, huge fan.

They have so many hits.

Hit after hit after hit.

It's undeniable.

They're great.

They're so good.

They have a lot of one hit wonders.

Yeah.

Okay.

So, if so many one hit wonders.

Aren't there, I feel like there's concerts, right?

Where they get all those bands together.

Yeah.

Like one hit wonder bands and they all do their, they get to do their shit.

I think it was, I think it was.

Yeah, I like it.

I've been to a few of those.

I enjoy them.

Okay.

So Tatiana is here.

Can I be like Elmo and Patsy should be there?

Yeah.

Elmo from Sesame Street with Patsy Klein.

Crazy.

Elmo go crazy.

Okay.

So Tatiana is here.

Elmo go walking after me.

He sounds like Jack the Ripper.

He's crazy.

He's going walking after me.

Wait, what was going on with Patsy?

Patsy Klein with she was Jack the Ripper.

She was giving us clues.

Oh, Mr. Bleezeman.

She gave us all the clues.

Hit her songs.

Okay.

Climb was Jack the Ripper.

This makes sense.

So Tatiana, she, she's done two episodes I believe since she was announced as she-hulk.

She did one to- This was the one where it was coming up this week.

And she did one earlier just for fun where we talked about, oh, you were just cast as she-hulk.

And each time she is on the show, we are just doing dumb bits like you've heard Paul and I doing.

And we say fake things that are going to happen on she-hulk this season.

And it always makes news.

People take it seriously.

That's right.

So before this, she mentioned that she was going to be singing in the show.

It's not easy being green by Kermit the Frog as well as Fever.

Fever makes me laugh so much.

It's so out of nowhere.

And it made a headline, comic book and nerd culture headlines.

You made nerd headlines.

That she-hulk was going to be a musical with these two songs in it.

And people believed it until the entire season was up and she never did it.

And people were like, where were those songs?

No, people believed it all the way even after she said it was just a fucking joke.

Yes.

Come on, guys.

So I think that happened on this one as well.

She said some fake things and people believed it.

I don't know.

But the other thing about this episode is that there's a certain person that Paul F.

Tompkins plays named Obi-Ron Kenobi.

Tell us about Obi-Ron Kenobi.

Obi-Ron Kenobi was a-I can't remember if I just had a name in my phone that made me laugh.

Wait, just a friend of yours that was in your phone?

No, no, no.

I keep a note in my notes app of character names.

If I think of a name and it makes me laugh, I write it down.

And I think I just wanted to do something new and I didn't want to have anything prepared.

And I thought that was as good as any jumping off point to have that very specific name and then not know anything about Star Wars.

And where did you do Obi-Ron for the first time?

It must have been on this episode.

On that episode.

Okay, so had you done him yet on the tour?

No, because you were waiting for this to drop.

And I think I even said in this episode, I'll join you on the tour.

I'll be there.

At the end, yeah.

Oh, I'll be there.

I'm trying to do Obi-Ron Kenobi.

It's pretty good.

So Obi-Ron, is anything you want to say about him or we're just going to hear the clip of it and talk about it?

I mean, it was, I really did not put a ton of preparation into this on purpose.

I wanted to just see where it went.

And we found it in the moment.

Yeah.

A lot of his characteristics that had become classic.

Exactly.

But it was really, yeah, it was really, it was really fun.

I, I, well, let's listen to it.

Let's listen to it.

Let's hear it.

This is your choice for episode number 16.

Number one, six.

This is all I know about him.

He's an American citizen citizen.

Oh, please welcome Obi-Ron Kenobi.

Hey there, Scott.

Thanks for having me.

Hey, great to meet you.

Yeah, it's nice.

It's nice to be here.

Hi there.

She's playing.

How are you doing?

She hulking the MCU.

Okay, if you say so.

And not, not MCU.

That's not a rapper like MC Hammer.

It's the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Oh, it's like movies.

Movies.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay, exactly.

Good, congratulations.

Good for you.

As well.

She's in a television show.

The cinema, does TV count at cinema?

I mean, it's an, it's a brand extension.

Yeah.

I'm not real up on pop culture.

Oh, really?

Why is that?

I don't know.

Your name is Obi-Ron Kenobi.

Yeah.

Oh, I get it.

Star Wars, right?

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

People bring that up a lot.

I've never seen them.

You didn't name yourself after.

This is in a stage name.

No, my name is Obi-Ron Kenobi.

It's not a stage name.

I'm not a stage actor.

Were your parents in, in the Star Wars or?

I don't think so.

Okay.

We never talked about it around the house.

Really?

Do they have a poster up or anything like that?

No, they were, I mean, they were parents.

So we didn't have a lot of posters hanging up.

I mean, I had a...

Parents aren't allowed to have posters.

No, parents are.

But I don't think parents.

A lot of parents are.

Once you have a baby, all the posters come down.

Well, you know, when you become a man, you put away childish things.

Oh, okay.

But yeah, they had like framed artwork and stuff.

Oh, like prints or like actual...

They didn't have any pictures of prints.

No, I guess what I mean to say is did they have the originals for today?

Well, I mean they were like, no, they didn't have like, you know, original.

Like, matheses or anything like that?

No, they had the art that they liked that they would put up some prints.

Yeah, sure.

Okay, great.

Yeah, when I was a kid, I didn't have a lot of posters because of you as a kid.

I wasn't really into pop culture that much.

If you're not into pop culture, un-pop culture?

What does that mean?

Unpopular culture.

I mean...

Well, I don't seek out things that are not popular to make them things that I'm into.

But I'm into like nature and a mid to...

I was supposed to nurture this.

Okay.

I've been to like nature, as I said.

And then also like the sun.

Or sometimes the moon.

Sometimes like half the day.

Yeah, when it's out.

When it's not out.

Stuff like that.

I'm less interested when it's not out.

It's true.

I don't look for it.

So wait, nature, the sun and the moon.

The moon?

Are you three primary interests?

I mean, mostly that's a bet.

Rocks?

Yeah.

You know, Tatiana over here had a rock o'clock alarm clock.

What is it?

It was like a alarm clock shaped like a rock?

That's not school.

It was Duane the Rock Johnson.

Are you familiar with him?

With his work?

No, Steve Fredafier's.

He is not, but I would love him to be.

Have you ever seen Get Smart?

Is that a movie?

It's not only a movie, but a movie based upon a television show.

Oh, I haven't seen either.

Yeah, I haven't seen either, though.

Do you know who Don Adams is?

No.

There would probably be no reason for you to know who he was without knowing Get Smart.

I'm trying to remember any other Don Adams role.

But the rock was he was he was in the movie adaptation.

Okay.

Starting with Steve Carell from the office.

What off American workplace?

I don't know.

Okay.

I'm going to say one word time.

I'm not bad at you because I've run into this a lot.

Okay.

I'm not real big of pop culture.

Okay.

You like nature.

I like nature.

The Sud.

The mood.

Rocks.

Words.

Really?

Absolutely.

Coming up at number five.

Words.

I mean, these are not in order.

Oh, really?

So what if you were to put those five in order?

What would the what would the ranking be?

Nature number one.

Sure.

Then number two, the sun.

Okay.

Number three.

The mood I'd have to say before rocks number five.

I guess it is.

It is the exact order.

Yeah.

The exact order.

Yeah.

Why are we so low?

I mean, they're the only living thing out of the things you've all though nature, I guess.

There's so but I mean, I should I should fold words into the rocks.

Yeah, you're right.

And probably the sun and the moon.

Yeah, I guess.

But I don't know.

I consider those because they're the sky.

They're different.

True.

But I don't consider birds different the nature.

They're the sky as well.

Yeah, maybe they're not as high in the sky.

Maybe as long as it's it's not past.

How about this?

Here's the because here's the thing.

I'm not that interested in space.

Okay.

I am interest like stars who cares.

I am interested in the wars therein.

Oh, right.

Yeah.

Star Wars.

Yeah.

So Obi-Wan Kenobi is who we're talking to.

Yes.

My name is O'Rocadobe.

Right.

You go abroad.

Rod Rod for short.

But but your name is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Yeah.

And you want me to call you Rod Rod?

Rod?

Yeah.

Oh, sorry.

Sorry.

Do you have a cold?

Yeah, always.

Why do you like nature so much?

Because you spend too much time out in nature.

It might be and I never wear a jacket.

Okay.

Do you camp without it?

Are you like a Wim Hof kind of dude?

Oh, what is Wim Hof part of pop culture?

Is that from Star Wars?

Yeah.

It sounds like it.

How do you know first of all?

Because people believe me.

I get grilled about the whole Star Wars universe.

And I don't even know what it's about Star Wars.

Here's what I here's what I've survived.

What do you think?

Yeah.

From just like absorbing, you know, what people have said.

It's like an alternate future where the Russians have already.

No, it's the past.

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away.

But there's it's space, right?

Space ships?

Yeah, but they're pretty new.

But human history didn't begin here on earth is what they're trying to say.

It's a no, it did.

Oh, okay.

So wait, what they're trying to say that human history started in the past and spaceship world and not all human.

Well, that's the thing is like we don't even know like some of them who look human are like all Iranian, I guess, or Tatooine and some of them are like aliens that play like clarinets and stuff like that.

Yeah.

I've heard of Jia's music.

Hey, man, it's what George Lucas.

I'm not here for this.

I believe it for a lot of people.

I'm not here for this kind of talk.

When were you when were you born?

Do you mind me asking?

I was born in 1972.

And okay, so that's five years before Star Wars was a thing.

Okay.

So are you the expert?

Did your parents not allow you to watch TV?

No, they begged me to.

Why?

Because you're always out in nature.

I was always outside getting dirty.

Yeah.

Always I never wore shoes, never wore a jacket, barely wore a shirt.

Bear.

What do you mean by barely?

Like you were wearing it.

Oh, yeah.

Like my parents put a polo shirt off me that I get out there like it's what I feel like I turn out and take it off.

Polo shirts were popular back then.

They sure were.

I remember them being popular in 82 or so.

You don't have to like about a polo shirt is the color is very soft.

The color is very soft.

Color.

Yeah, yeah, although sometimes they're made of muted colors as well.

That's true.

So we're both right.

You seem like a really interesting guy, Ron.

If I.

Hey, thank you.

If I can call you Ron.

Literally no one has ever said that to me.

What are you here for?

I mean, it's I have an important message.

Oh, okay.

Great.

Should we should we tease that we'll do it after the break?

Touch down to your television.

I don't know if we should.

No, really?

Yeah, we should get it out right now.

Okay.

All right.

Okay.

You have a step.

Yeah.

Heavily established.

And so the prices are right at the end of the prices right.

The host of the prices right says this is something I've been told and I maybe angry.

I just learned this today and I was like, book me on a podcast because I got to tell people he goes and he apparently says at the end of every episode.

He goes first of all, I would think he would say what the price is.

Oh, that's the big mystery at the end of the show.

They've said that right before just previous to this.

Okay.

All right.

Yeah.

And he goes, spay and doodle your pets.

Yeah.

And here's what I want to say.

Only doodle your pets because then you don't have to spay the rest of them.

I guess that's a good point.

Why are we spaying these animals?

If we just neuter the ones that need to be neutered, then the spade ones can go about their business.

Here's I would I would differ with you in one respect.

Let's spay them all because that takes care of the problem right there.

Like if you don't space some, then the ones who are unneutered are going to get in there.

I don't think that's fair because I think I think the first sterilization of all the females is what I'm trying to say.

Yeah, I know what you're trying to say.

I'm saying the opposite.

That's what you're all about.

That's what I was been about for the best.

Wow.

Weird coincidence that I came on to talk about this.

And you've been saying the exact opposite of the thing.

I mean, I would say that's the issue is is that we're not going to get to all the dogs that we need to neuter.

So let's spay them.

No, we have to is the message.

We have to.

And it's not just dogs.

There's also cats, guinea pigs, parrots.

You got to you got to do to everything that is in nature that is a male chop them off.

Get about it there.

But you're in nature.

Ron.

Ron or Ron?

Ron.

It's never Rod.

It sounds like Rod, but it is Ron.

Okay, but that's I understand because of my voice.

Right.

Yeah.

You have to come and do that to you.

No, Ron.

You're putting this on top of it.

You're part of nature.

Are you not?

Are you part of nature?

Yes.

Then off with your balls.

You fell to my trap.

Is it the ball?

I always thought it was the penis.

No.

It's so it's so you can't get anything pregnant.

Right, right.

But you do have fun.

But shouldn't you just shouldn't you take care of the penis as well while you're down there?

Always take care of it.

You got to clean it.

It's usually the opposite.

It's like while you're down there, take care of the boss.

If you got a foreskin.

Oh, boy, boy.

Oh, man.

That's a lot of work.

Okay.

So I shouldn't have waited for the for the break for that.

Nope.

I think we made the right call.

Okay.

All right.

Number one, six.

There it was.

He loves nature.

Told you.

Told you we would play it.

Yeah.

It was really, you know, to to get to be in a place of I'm going to take what comes.

Logan, you know, why?

What is that?

That's a very specific dick.

And it's very strange.

I know.

We've talked about it on freedom, but anytime you hear a place you go to Logan.

Yeah.

Well, it started as I was in a bad place and then you go.

Oh, okay.

Which is a shitty little town in California.

If people don't know, made famous by Creed and Clearwater Revival.

Oh, what did they say about it?

They they're stuck in low die again.

Oh, okay.

Oh, Lord.

Stuck in low die again.

Hmm.

Can't tell if this is a joke or not.

It is the lyrics.

Oh, hey, I did not know that.

I did not know that.

I believe there's a prison up there.

Wouldn't be surprised.

Well, that's lompoc.

Lompoc is the, but it's over by there.

Lompoc, of course, I remember from the movie, Autocyte.

That's right.

Sexy movie.

You would be stuck in a trunk with J.Lo and that big ass.

Ooh, that trunk.

Two trunks.

That's what they were going to call the movie.

There's two trunks.

You like Ocean's 8?

This is two trunks.

Ocean's 8, remember who's out on the bus?

That's right.

On tour.

I forgot.

We had to, we were, we bought what we thought were train tickets turned out to be a bus.

To be fair, they were mostly train tickets and then they turned into bus tickets at one point.

Yep.

And the train was like a, a transformer and it turned into a bus.

Yeah.

And it was terrible transform.

It was sentient and it talked to us the whole way.

About Optimus Prime.

His buddy.

The most boring stories about Optimus Prime.

What can we, at some point we have to re-litigate the Transformers and how stupid that was.

It's so dumb.

It's so, you know, I, I, as a, as a screenwriter since the 90s, occasionally my agent will bring me projects and say, hey, they're interested in making a Transformers movie.

And this happened to me in 2002, maybe.

This is no matter what the project is, that's how he puts it.

Anyway, here's Get Smart.

I did, I did pitch on that.

I did pitch on that.

But I remember they, they brought, they said, hey, are you interested in pitching on Transformers movie?

And I said, well, it's so stupid.

It would have to be a comedy, right?

And instead they made the most deadly serious version possible and made a ton of money.

Life or death stakes, huge explosions.

So crazy.

And anytime the lore comes in of like, I am Optimus Prime.

It's the all spark.

It's so funny to me because it's so dumb.

I could turn into a truck.

Broom, broom.

My people are a truck like people.

Well, that was Obi-Ron Kenobi later, by the way, on the episode Caitlyn Riley came on.

That was her first episode.

She was very funny.

We're going to take a break, Paul.

I think we should.

And when we come back, we're still going to be counting this down if you can believe it.

Somehow I can.

Yep.

All right.

We'll be right back with more comedy, bang, bang.

Somehow counting down feels inevitable in a place like this.

Nicole Kidman.

Oh, Kidman.

We're back.

Yep.

We are back.

We, you know, my wife, Janie and I, we watch all the country award.

Don't try to push it off with somebody else.

Yeah, you're the guy.

This is like, it follows.

We watch all the country award shows.

My wife is a country music guy.

And but I, I enjoy watching these shows, but it is like, it's like a weird little TV show unto itself where there's artists that I only know from country award shows.

Right.

That's the only place I see them and hear their music.

Well, it's a lot like watching the challenge on the one chip on Paramount Plus where it's like, what's the challenge?

The challenge is, well, it started as the real real world road rules challenge.

This is a warm up by the way.

40 years.

They were like, nobody can say this.

By the way, the real world.

Yeah.

I didn't mention this on the episode we did about don't tell mom the babysitter's dead, but that was the title of the movie originally and the title that the screenwriter really wanted was the real world.

And unfortunately for him, the MTV show came out and they couldn't go.

And what a bad title.

It was a bad title.

No bummed that they changed it to don't tell mom the babysitter's dead.

Let me tell you this.

I don't think don't tell mom the babysitter's dead is a great title, but it's definitely catchy.

Yes, you're definitely like what?

What?

I'm not supposed to wait.

What did you say?

Why am I not?

Don't tell who the what's dead.

Don't what the who the wow how the wind.

So it's a good title.

It's a good title.

Why were we talking about?

Oh, yeah.

What world road rules challenge?

It was originally that and then it got turned into the challenge all stars.

Also all this kind of stuff.

They just did a version of it where it took stars from your favorite CBS reality shows.

Big brother, survivor.

And the price is right.

Yep.

Let's make a deal.

But it's like celebrities that you only see on those shows.

It's very funny.

You're like, I know who they are because but you never see them anywhere else.

But is Ken Jennings the most famous game show contestant?

Has anyone else become?

Not maybe a show guy.

They may have been a movie about him.

Charles Van Doren.

Yeah.

But I mean nobody else.

There's has to be someone who was on a game show because nobody else then became famous.

You can't get up for being on a game show, but you can't get a run going on any other game show like it will fortune.

You're not going to be on for multiple episodes.

You can only be on one.

Yeah.

I guess prices right.

You can only be on one.

Yeah.

I would love to see a price.

Like somebody has a run on prices, right?

Or they're like, you know what?

Stick around.

We're going to bring back tomorrow.

Who wants to be a millionaire?

They made that mini series starting this succession guy with his actual accent.

The husband of one of who is the daughter.

Oh Tom Wamsgans.

Yes.

Matthew McFadden.

Yeah.

Yes.

He's great.

He's always great.

I mean, this is all original.

And so now anytime I watch succession, I'm like, I heard you speak for real.

I was not strategic a million.

Why did you mention the country music awards?

Because of Keith Urban and Nicole Kidman.

Yes.

They're all of them.

They're in the front row.

They know the words to every song.

They love it.

And we always remember at some point, oh yeah, they're Australian, both of them.

Yeah.

It's weird that they're there.

So when they sing country music, the country of Australia, that's the, that's the, when you sing country music, you have to picture your country, you have to visualize your country.

And for them, it is Australia.

Yeah.

They picture the movie Australia, which she was in.

In.

Yes, she was.

Okay.

Good.

A Bazzlerman movie.

Bazzlerman movie.

She was in and someone else must have been in it.

Or was it just her?

She, Jackman, both Australians.

Huge, huge man.

Like gigantic Australian stars.

I saw he got a Golden Globe nomination.

And I was sitting there going for what?

I just saw his name for best actor.

I was like, for what?

Yeah, he's been doing Broadway.

Yeah.

What could he have possibly been in?

I don't know.

We don't know.

Also, I thought they weren't doing the Golden Globe anymore.

They should.

I honestly thought they went away.

They did for a year.

And then they came back this year under a provisional basis.

And the, the funny thing is, is no celebrity could comment on, you know, how you always reach out to the publics of like, are you excited?

Did you get the award?

Yeah.

No, dead silence.

No one felt like they could comment on being excited.

Wow.

For the Golden Globes.

It's very funny.

Because then it's like, and are you aware that they were corrupt before?

And you were participating in that system?

So I wonder if any would even ghost.

Oh my God.

What's Ricky Gervais going to say?

I don't think he, who's hosting it?

I can't recall.

But I hope it's somebody who speaks truth to power.

Yeah.

Did you hear, by the way, that the, the balance of power in the DC universe has been?

It's shifted.

What?

Who's in charge?

No.

Is it dark seed or dark side?

Dark side because I think that is the pun is the dark side.

Bad.

Yeah.

Bad, bad work guys.

Yep.

Jack Kirby blame him.

Jerby.

Jack Kirby, your enthusiasm for that name.

Jack Kirby, your enthusiasm.

There's a show.

Um, all right.

Let's get to it.

Sounding down your, uh, this, this episode we're doing 17 through 13.

Let's get to, this is your choice for episode 15.

Number one five.

All right.

Episode 15.

This is episode 785.

So we're still in the latter part of the 700.

Yeah, we still are.

And I'm going to put this one.

This is, this takes place in November.

It does.

October 21st of 2022.

And in fact, is the final episode that is eligible for the countdown.

It made it onto the countdown.

Nice work.

And this is an episode called buzz year headlines.

Mm.

Buzz year headlines.

Title does not ring a bell.

Paul, you were not in this one.

Maybe that's why.

That's probably why.

Um, I will tell you that, uh, Jason man, Zukas, our friend from the league.

Zukas.

And how did this get made?

Still from the league.

He'll never not be from the league.

From the dictator.

From infinite on Paramount plus.

And a fucking, uh, prodigy, Star Trek prodigy.

Yeah, he's great on prodigy.

Yeah.

Um, he's also, I believe the muse next not bubble or something.

Yes, he is.

Yeah.

Um, our good friends, he's on the show quite often.

This was his, uh, first of two episodes back in the studio in the same week, I believe.

We taped this episode and then, uh, we got a call that something happened in the news.

And so he came back the following week and did another episode.

But Jason, uh, if you know Jason and he talks about this, I believe on how did this get made.

He, when the pandemic started, he was the, um, the person I had, I had built up a backlog of I think five or six comedy bang bang episodes.

I was really ahead at that point.

I was like, and then everything got shut down and I was on a zoom with him, um, the first week of the pandemic.

And I said, so I have five or six episodes, like I should be good.

This will be done.

Right?

And he goes, Oh no, this is going to be two years.

And I was like, what?

That can't be false.

He goes, Oh no.

Yeah.

We're going to be in our houses for two years.

And prosecute slash men's hookups.

And so it actually set my expectations accordingly where I was like, Oh, he might be right.

And, and we did weekly zooms over the pandemic.

And then we, uh, we'd get together in our backyard with him, uh, when it was safe to be with people just outside.

And so, um, good, good friend.

And he's been on the show ever since the beginning.

This is the point he had just on tour, uh, with how did this get made?

He, he was stepping out and taking a chance and going on tour with them three days into it.

He caught COVID and canceled the tour.

So this was the week or so after he had recuperated from COVID and he was like, felt safe going into studios.

So he did two episodes with us, uh, within a week's time.

And this one came out second, but it was the first one that we did.

Um, and, uh, so he is there.

And then, um, we have, uh, Seth Morris comes and, uh, this was by request from Jason, uh, does his character of Bob Duka by request.

You can request characters.

I don't know if you know that Jason never requested any.

Anyone can, by the way, any fan can just request a character and we'll do it.

What?

Yeah, including me, including you.

Including just anyone who listens to the show.

Jay, did you happen to be Jason this episode?

It happened to be Jadakiss.

I thought you were going to happen to be Jadakiss.

Jadakiss, if you're out there, please release an album called, Hey Scott.

It's me, Jadakiss.

Listen.

A shanty.

By the power of a shanty.

What is it?

You know how she's am staying.

Hey Achilles, Solomon, H Hercules, Hercules, Hercules.

Hey, hey, Atlas and Nero.

Yeah.

Neptune.

T.

The, the Grinch.

Grumpy.

This, I mean, he was pretty strong.

He was probably a dog was strong, but I mean, he was the planner.

He was the planner.

He's very shrewd.

And then of course.

I, I, um, Isis.

Isis.

Oh, my.

Isis.

Not, not the goddess Isis.

The, or is it.

Yes.

Percussation.

Again, I want to, I want to reiterate this because, um, it, it, people need to know it's not how the Grinch stole Christmas.

That's not the interesting part.

No, we don't care.

The interesting part is why, why do you do this motivation?

Yes.

How he stole stuff.

Yeah.

Easy.

And he took things.

Yes.

And when that's the other interesting part and when Christmas.

Yeah.

Christmas Eve, right?

Yeah.

The Grinch cartoon starts with the Grinch crossing, Xing off days in the calendar.

Yeah.

And he does the entire year, all nine months or all 12 11 and a half months until finally, I'm confused on how many months.

Sure are.

All that.

I'm saying, I'm saying nine months because that's been on the brain for years.

Of course, because of baby.

No, because I love that movie.

What the hell were you thinking?

Hugh Grant.

Hugh Grant's in Julian Moore and he was promoting that on the Tonight Show when he got that Hugh Grant famous lover of blowjobs.

And, uh, hey, if he's guilty, then so are we all.

But, um, uh, and Robin Williams was a doctor who kept fainting.

I don't know.

I've never seen it.

I just seen the commercial.

That's all I remember.

Yeah, that's pretty good.

Um, I've never seen that movie.

I just saw it two years ago.

Um, okay.

So Jason requested that our good friend, Seth Morris, has done this character Bob Dooka ever since the beginning long running character long running character.

I happened to see him do this on stage 14 years or so ago.

And, um, Seth is a brilliant comedian, um, who with an incredible mind.

And when I say what I love about his mind is he has, he has life experience and references which are not what comedians are normally interested in, in things that comedians don't pull from.

Um, he has done a lot of stuff like Burning Man and healing and all sorts of things.

He has a lot of varied interests.

And so he's got an incredible mind and Bob Dooka is, is one of his greatest creations.

And, um, so this is his return.

Yeah.

I don't think he'd done an episode for three years maybe since the 10th anniversary as Bob Dooka.

So this was his, his return.

Uh, let's hear it.

This is your choice for episode 15.

Number one, five.

Um, well, Jason, it's good to see you.

I, uh, of course, uh, love having you here.

And it's, uh, always a pleasure to have you.

And, uh, I really want you to be more excited to spend the rest of the night.

Oh, we're.

Scott.

I'm sorry.

We're doing a show.

Oh, well, I need your help.

Sorry.

We're doing a show.

Whoever this is.

We know this person.

This is.

Yeah.

Who are you?

Sir, step out of the shadows.

Why are you?

Also, why are there slow to shadow right now?

Why are the studios lit like a, a noir movie?

Yeah.

Why is happening right now?

Are you the Phantom of the Opera's or I can only see half of your face.

The Phantom of the sky.

It's Bob.

Bob who Bob.

Oh, Bob.

Do Bob Dooka.

How dare you.

You young man get over my knee, right?

Oh, do it Scott.

All right.

Here we go.

Oh, yes.

Ow.

You nasty naughty little boy.

You will have respect for me.

This is the, this is the maybe the only time I've seen Scott jump to yes and any initiation from anyone ever and do so with a degree of enthusiasm that was frankly terrifying.

I am having a horrible, horrible day.

I came in here for just a little bit of respite.

The last thing I expected was for my dear, dear, very close ex-step son to not recognize me.

I'm so sorry, Bob.

I just didn't expect to see you.

We're doing, we're in the middle of a show.

Do you know Jason and Zuko?

Yes, we've met before here in, in, in these studios.

Yeah.

And recall that's okay.

For those of you who do not recall who Bob Dooka is your gentleman that was married to my mother for how long nine months?

Six glorious months.

Six glorious months back in the, it doesn't matter.

In the 90s or something.

It was a long time.

It was like yesterday to me.

What did you tell me?

You and I meet very, very close.

I mean, as all father, son relationships are, are they difficult?

Are they not?

They're difficult.

They're tough.

Yes.

I have a big, craggly shadow that you live under and, and you and I as a stepchild is always difficult to, to be friend and I will never stop trying.

That's my promise to you, though I am still angry that you didn't remember me.

Well, it's not that I didn't remember you because I didn't know you were coming.

I just, I could not see you.

And I, to be honest, I haven't.

Put those two together for me.

You don't remember me because you didn't know I was coming.

Well, you also, it's interesting.

You didn't see me and I understand because yes, the doorway to the studio is shrouded in deep shadow.

Yeah, they're saving on electricity or something.

I don't know.

Maybe it is going on in here.

I didn't know that you recorded an old timey vaudeville theater.

I tripped over so many sandbags.

There's so many dusty, velour curtains that I had to push through to get here.

But what's strange to me is you didn't seem to recognize his very iconic voice.

Well, yeah, that's what I, that's what I keep.

I was like, oh, I know this is.

I have voice blindness.

I'm sorry.

Oh, yeah.

I've never mentioned that.

Let's call Oliver Sacks ears.

But Scott, yes, I just need a few minutes to collect myself and compose myself and receive some sucore after the difficult, very difficult day that I've had.

What happened?

Okay, fine.

I'll tell you.

As you may or may not know, I've been on a wedding rice diet for a few weeks.

What is a wedding?

I drink, I eat only dry rice that I find outside of churches.

I have to bat away birds.

It's very well, well earned, cheap, get a lot of upper arm.

So you only, I'm assuming you mostly can only eat on the weekends.

Right.

It's not a lot of weekday weddings.

I guess you could save up if they had a big rice budget for the wedding.

You can.

I have cargo pants with rice pockets.

Do you pick up each grain individually or do you have like a dust bust?

Do you have a scoop?

Yeah.

Oh, really?

I just get down there.

So you don't save any?

Look how wide my tongue is.

Oh my gosh.

Jesus Christ.

It's like, it's like, you know, like you've been exercising it clearly.

You know, yeah.

It's like that tongue emoji where it's like, yeah, my tongue looks like like a like a display or first saltwater taffy machine, but it's not actually saltwater taffy.

Yeah, it's Jack.

Right.

It's like muscular.

Oh, yeah.

Jack tongue.

Yeah.

How do you work that out?

I mean, obviously doing your church exercises, but did you model for that emoji, by the way?

Because that's almost identical.

Oh, I did.

I never got paid for that though.

Do people model for those?

Oh, yes.

How many emojis have you modeled for?

Seven.

Seven, which ones?

Well, I'll just have to show you the one with the thinking one.

Oh, yeah.

We'll check this out.

Oh, wow.

Yeah.

What about that one with the monocle?

The one that's barfing?

You know what?

And that wasn't doing it right.

The guy poked me in the eye.

Oh, gosh.

The barf emoji, obviously.

The barf emoji.

Yeah.

The skiing emoji.

Oh, I love that one.

Yeah.

I use that one all the time.

So helpful.

They should break emojis down into like, these are the ones that people use.

And these are the ones that are like, oh, yeah.

You're never going to use ever again unless you are actually talking about skiing.

I feel like a lot of weirdos would find each other that way.

If you could find which part of the country different people used emojis.

You should invent this app, Bob.

What's an app?

Oh, yeah, never mind.

Anyway, back to my bad day.

So I was on this dry rice diet.

Not thinking I accidentally drank a lot of water in my stomach almost exploded.

Oh, gosh.

All the moisture went right to that dry and dry rice.

I got very, very ill and was homebound for several days.

And then I went to treat myself to a car wash chair and massage and got stuck.

So everyone thought that you were trying to just hog the chair?

Right.

So they beat me with steering wheel coverage.

Oh, no.

Yes.

You couldn't explain.

And then they made a game of it.

Oh, wow.

I was defending myself.

And then it became a ring toss.

It became a ring toss.

So you stuck your hands out to defend yourself.

And then they started throwing.

And they started having fun.

I mean, it was, you know, when you're tickled too much and you want it to stop at your body's laughing so people think, how often does that happen to you as an adult?

Can we talk about something else?

I, I, you want to do the original topic or something from like deep childhood.

Never mind.

Like, I have no offense, Bob, but you're an older man.

Is that there are people tickling you to the point where you say this?

Let's just say this.

I very well known in the adult tickling community.

Not as a participant necessarily, but as a really participant anymore.

At first it sounds like, sure, I'll make a couple extra bucks and some free food.

I like crudetay.

I want to go to Oman, just like anybody else.

But then it just keeps going and going and it doesn't stop.

So anyway, needless to say, I've had a very, very tough day and I just came here to relax.

What about you, though, Bob?

What has been going on with you?

Thank you for asking.

You're becoming a better step next step, son.

Well, to earn a few extra shackles, I've been, got hired to create BuzzFeed headlines.

This is a quiz.

You just want to know which lunchable you are.

Is that that article?

I'm not saying that this was directly taken from BuzzFeed, but I'm also not saying that it's not not.

Okay.

Paul, you're low T. You've always said that.

I was super low T. My T is through the floor.

No, I was curious if anybody.

Which is the roof for some other people?

Exactly.

So if you're perspective.

Yeah.

And I was curious as to does anybody identify anything other than an alpha male?

Are they like, I'm a beta and I know it.

That's great.

And then I read this thing where this guy was explaining, you know, like how important beta males are.

And he was like, in my friend group, I'm the alpha.

It was like, yeah, of course.

You think that.

Of course you think that.

But the beta he's talking about this is if the beta is your lieutenant and he keeps the friend group running smoothly at all.

It's like, what the fuck are these guys talking about?

I'm a gamma.

Oh, nice.

Good for you.

You're needed.

Yeah.

I'm the lowest of the.

You're like the grunt in the friend group.

Yep.

I hate myself.

This episode, Paul started with, we didn't hear it, but it started with a guy named Shimi meeting a guy named Jarls.

Wait, and hold on.

What the one we just the episode before the clip that we just heard, it started with a guy named Shimi meeting a guy named Jarls.

These are two people we're getting here from later.

I just wanted to throw that out there.

Yeah.

Okay.

So the clip we just started with Seth doing Bob Duka.

Yeah.

That episode started with Shimi and Jarls.

Yes.

I don't see how that's possible.

It was not only possible, but it happened.

This was an in studio episode and in studio episode.

Yes.

They, they, these are two people will talk about them later, but they're trapped in the studio.

Okay.

Dredulous studio.

I don't.

I have no recollection of that whatsoever.

Well, it happened.

Okay.

Cause we, we, we lift them veil for these episodes.

Sure.

I play both Jarls and Shimi.

Yes.

I don't remember coming into the studio.

I'll tell you what happened.

Okay.

You want to lift the veil?

Let's lift it all the way up.

We did the Bob Duka episode and that was Jason's first one back.

Right.

And then something happened, which we'll talk about later, and we had to do another episode that was going to come up before this one.

That you are in.

Yeah.

And so we swapped the openings.

That's right.

And so you taped to the opening to this episode when we did the other episode and we swapped them.

A flip-flop.

Flip-flop.

That's how, that's why Jarls and Shimi were there.

Chris Cross strangers on the train.

That's true.

I would love to see Chris Cross be in more movies.

They have those backward pants.

And they did murders for each other.

That's how they became a rap group.

By the way, that episode after the clip you just heard Erin Whitehead came on and she did a fly buzzing around the studio and they, Seth and she really love working together.

They did a full throttle episode of CBB Presents where Erin is on the phone helping Bob and it's so funny.

It's really funny.

The funny things.

It's really, really funny.

And so they really like working together, which after they did that episode together, it inspired them to start their new show, College Town Together, which we've been having over at CBB Presents.

Two people with really interesting minds doing show together.

I really enjoy that.

All right, let's take a break.

When we come back, we're going to be still counting things down if you can imagine something like that.

This is what we said we would do and we're going to fucking do it.

All right, we'll be right back with more comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang bang, we are back.

I just took a sip of water.

After I said we are back, I was hoping Paul would fill the void and instead he was looking down at the ground.

I was looking at the table.

Of course, it has many signatures from over the years and I was just checking it out.

Yeah, just checking it out.

I mean, how I didn't realize that would be so focused for you saying we're coming back, blah, blah, blah.

And then why would you decide to take a sip of water then?

I don't know.

I just pour planning.

I got incredibly thirsty right after I said that.

Why don't you do it?

The break.

We were on a break, sipping water.

All right, we're counting things down, Paul.

We are, we have two more clips to play and why don't we get to it.

This is your choice for episode 14.

Number one, four.

All right, Paul, this is episode.

All right, Paul.

Come on, Paul.

This is episode 746.

So we're in the middle of the 700s.

Yeah, no, we're in the early 700s.

We're not even in the middle yet.

It's a little 46.

Yeah.

750 I consider to be.

In the exact center.

Yes.

So you'd only say the middle if we're talking about the exact center.

Yes.

Come on, Scott.

45 is mid 40s.

Scott, this is beneath you.

Well, if you were 44, would you say your mid 40s?

Yeah.

That's the wisdom of a fool.

I'm 54 now.

Do you think your mid 50s?

I'm in my mid 50s.

No, your early 50s.

That's how I consider you to be.

Because that's how you want to consider yourself.

Yeah.

All right, this is episode 746.

Hold on.

Isn't it weird to be in your 50s?

What a strange thing.

So weird.

It's so weird.

I hate it.

I thought it was so old.

I know.

And we're just normal guys.

We're just horrible guys.

We're terrible broken down bodies.

True.

And old references.

All right, so this is from early in the year.

This is February 28.

Ciao, ciao, ciao, ciao.

February 28.

And this is an episode called James Bond Dolls for sale.

I know exactly what this is.

You know what this is called?

This is a backyard era episode.

Absolutely.

Yes.

And this episode features our friend Langston Kerman.

Really great guy from the show Busdown on Peacock.

Amongst other things.

He was on Easter.

Dog boys.

He was on the boys as a superhero.

He was on Easter.

Show called insecure as a love interest.

Has his own podcast?

Yes.

Called my momma told me.

Yep.

Really great guy.

I met him on the oss.

No, no, no.

I met him doing a pilot.

And then we worked together writing the Oscars one year.

Really great guy.

Really fun to him.

He was doing an episode promoting Busdown.

And we're going to hear two clips.

We're going to hear two clips.

Two clips of me and you could be moving forward.

First we're going to be talking to Langston and you're going to hear Paul here.

And Matt Gorley.

Matt Gorley whom people know from Super Ego and also from Bonanas for Bonanza.

And it's got.

Yep.

And Conan O'Brien needs a friend.

Oh, that's right.

I forgot he was in that.

He's one of the chill chums.

Yes.

Matt Gorley was on promoting.

Matt allowed to meet Michelle Obama.

Is that so?

He couldn't get clearance?

I mean, there was an episode that they did with Michelle Obama and it was just Conan.

Like so it was not there.

Matt was not there.

This is according to Instagram.

Interesting.

Yeah.

Wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder.

Wonder.

That's from a physical one.

One hit wonder.

So Matt Gorley was there with his band Townland.

And they were promoting the release of their CD.

So we're going to hear the first clip is me talking to Langston and then suddenly both you and Matt Gorley start doing phony calls in the middle of a block.

That's right.

And then we're going to hear a clip of Matt Gorley doing Paige who is pretty self-explanatory.

But most importantly, this marks the debut of a brand new Paul of Tompkins character.

So we'll be hearing that.

This is your choice for episode 14.

Number one, four.

You watched that three point shootout or the dunk contest?

Not a minute of it.

Not one minute.

I didn't want to waste my time.

I knew it wasn't going to be worth the damn.

I heard it was, I mean, I watched the tail end of the dunk contest, which means I caught approximately three made dunks and 18 failed dunks.

And this is not a sports podcast by the way.

This is your first time listening to Comedy Bang Bang.

This is not a sports podcast.

You don't have to run away from it.

You stay right here.

We happen to be two men.

Hey, Scott Langston.

I'm going to say the headband's now.

I predicted this.

I don't know if you remember.

You guys a couple of years ago, you said headbands will never be back in the NBA.

This is it.

It's done.

No.

And then I remember saying like they're coming back, they're coming back and here they are.

Okay, sir.

Wait, wait, wait.

How did you get this number?

But this is a what?

How did you get this number?

I know how you get any other number.

How did you get this one?

How did I get your number?

I'm also a little concerned that how did you manage a phone call before we picked up?

How did I manage that?

Yeah.

How did you manage that?

How did you get this number?

Okay.

Love you.

I didn't know we were a phone call podcast.

Okay.

We're not a sports podcast.

We're not a phone call in podcast either.

I guess what you are now.

The minute two guys start talking about sports, we suddenly have to start taking calls.

You got to take a call.

Man.

It's a long time long time.

I just want to say this is Mark Knuffler.

The Band-Dyer straights started off.

Bob Booey.

Wait, you're like Mark Knuffler?

I ditched the action.

When you say Bob Booey, you're supposed to hang up.

Sorry.

I sneezed.

Oh wait, that wasn't a true Bob Booey.

What's a Bob Booey?

Oh, it's a thing that...

Oh, Bob Booey.

Oh, shit.

He got me.

He's got a likeson.

This is P-talented from the hoop.

Oh, oh.

Oh, not a musical legend.

This is a nice one.

This is an honor, honestly.

Who do you see in this year's upcoming home run turkey?

I'll take my ass off the air.

Bob Booey.

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Guess I got a watch.

Me child to Pete Taunton somehow to give him the answer off the air.

This is...

Wow.

This started odd.

I'll be honest.

But I guess that's what happened when two bros sit down and talk about sports.

We got to stay away from sports.

Pete Taunton and Mark Knuffler call.

A lot of Bob Booey said we can't handle.

I can handle more than one Bob Booey.

They're still on it.

Oh, they're just hanging out.

After you say Bob Booey.

Okay, bless you.

These said that are for killer me.

What?

Oh, hey, who are you?

My name is Mark Knuffler.

Oh, hey, it's P.P. Chelson.

Oh, hi, Bob Booey.

Bob Booey.

Can you think they have more to talk about?

Yeah, I do.

Two incredible guitarists.

And who've never met each other, obviously.

I don't think so.

Yeah, I mean, one does the windmill style.

The other kind of...

It almost touches over it.

They had never heard of each other?

Like, they're just being polite when they say, no, nice to meet you.

Oh, yeah, cool.

I mean, it's not that far-fetched for P.T.H.H.

Chelson did not too have heard of Mark Knuffler.

Hey, what band are you in?

What band are you in?

I'm so lorist.

Oh.

We have to be talented since he's a solo artist.

Yeah, he's not good.

Like, I mean, solo stuff's okay, I guess.

But it's also he introduced himself to us as from the hoo.

But then opted not to tell...

Yeah.

A peer, really.

Yeah, weird.

Yeah.

But, well, anyway, that's what happens on Comedy Bank Game when two bros start talking about sports.

We'll stay away from it.

We'll stay away.

We don't know more sports talk.

But speaking of music, though, we do have some musicians on today, sure.

Are you excited?

That is exciting.

I do like music.

I'm a big fan.

What's your favorite musical note?

Ooh, ooh, tough question.

I'm going to go with G.

G.

Yeah, I like a good G.

I like a flat.

Okay.

I like a little bit above.

You know, I like it in bra sizes.

Like a musical note.

Hey, me too, you know.

Give me a big obnoxiously heavy tit, you know.

A G.

Oh, G.

Oh, I got it.

Oh, I thought you meant for mine.

I love a hurtback.

You know?

You're just somebody else.

I can quite tell.

Pick it up that tit made by the actor.

Wait, wait, wait.

It's two guys talking about tits now.

Oh, no, we're going to get calls.

We're going to get calls.

Oh, yeah.

Hey, it's this Mark Knopfler.

Yeah, I just want to say, keep doing what you're doing.

Oh, God.

No, I knew you were so hard.

No one ever changed.

Mark, Mark, Mark.

Oh, my God.

I'm a D sharp, by the way.

I like those old kind of pointy, bity, page things.

Oh, it's me, the ghost of meatloaf.

Oh, no, meatloaf.

Wow, you I can't tell if your voice is sounding haunted or just as bad as it was right before you passed away.

It's the way that I sound.

Also, you run what I had tits at my club.

Well, but we start talking about tits.

The guy who had tits in Fight Club calls it.

I think I think if we talk about anything that's that's not what this show is about.

No, no, it's not about cards.

It's not about tits.

It's about it's it's.

I mean, it used to be the show where we talked to interesting people, but now it is humanity and the animal kingdoms podcast.

Except for hi, I'm Sharon, the three breasted woman from Total Recall.

Oh, yeah.

I just wanted to say that.

Oh, yeah.

Do you know the what's his name?

The Quattoo?

Quattoo.

Do you know it's not the it's a he it's a.

Oh, that's a Christian name.

Well, it's a living soul.

I thought I thought that was his species.

No, I think that's his name.

So so someone named him Quattoo.

Quattoo?

Quattoo.

Yeah, someone named you Scott.

Yeah, because there are a million other scottos.

Oh, and Scott, you're being a little judgmental about Quattoo.

There's a million motherfuckers on this planet.

Okay.

Are there any calls for me?

Oh, yeah.

Did you have a message for Quattoo?

Yeah.

Oh, is it Sharon?

Yeah.

Sharon.

Sharon, I sent you something and I something at home.

And when you get home, you're in for a big surprise.

Oh, come on.

Let's do the let's make a deal three curtain thing with my breast.

Absolutely.

Always change your choice.

Always change.

Always change with the first one.

Hey, Quattoo, would you say would you say Sharon like Ozzy Osborn did?

Sharon.

I love it.

Well, that does impress him.

Well, we have some musicians over here that we want to talk to you and they they are musicians of notes.

They and several notes.

They put them all together and they put out a an album that it just came out.

It's called Townland.

No, it's called Hunting on the High Fye.

The band is called Townland and we have a representative of them here on the mic here who is an old friend of the show.

Matt Gorley has the one mic that he can talk to us with.

Stay away from the mic I'll handle this.

Hey, let me in there.

No, no.

It's me, Shimmy.

No, I already didn't have my name as the band.

I play the bread drums.

Hey, Matt.

Hey, what do you think of this?

What do you think of this playing above us right now?

Well, that's a helicopter.

Is it a helicopter?

I'm looking for someone.

Hey, Shimmy.

You?

Fuck off.

All right, I'm talking about.

Well, we need to get to our next guest.

She's a podcast guest.

She was on the show once before.

Please welcome back Paige, the AI podcast guest.

Hello, Scott.

How cool man.

Hi, Paige.

So great to have you back.

It is wonderful to be here.

I am Paige, podcast art, official intelligence guest interface.

Welcome.

This is Langston Kerman.

It is a pleasure to meet you.

It's a pleasure to meet you, Paige.

It is also a pleasure to meet you.

Oh, I didn't know we were serving it back to each other.

It is time to play verbal pickleball.

Oh, boy.

I want out Paige.

I do too.

Paige, this is L.A.

Peterson, the smooth criminal.

L. Can you tell if I am sleeping?

Just being.

You're pretending to be asleep.

Absolutely right.

I'll be honest with you, not like that other guy.

Which other guy?

Matt Gourley.

Oh, yes.

I know that other guy.

Yeah, Matt, this is Paige, by the way, Matt.

Hi, Paige.

Hello.

How are you?

I'm good.

It's hard to...

I don't quite know who I'm talking to here.

Let me explain.

Paige, Paige is an artificial intelligence who is the first artificial intelligence developed exclusively to be a podcast guest.

I believe.

Absolutely.

Every single podcast has been fed into my database and I can exist in conversation due to all of the information put in me.

So all 750 episodes of this show, plus all the live ones, all can be found on CBBworld.com.

Oh, no, we're not doing that.

Oh, no.

Oh, you said oh no.

Oh, no.

Okay, great.

I have that in my database, but I have so much these days because podcast is exponential that it is almost too much for me to bear and I love to be a real girl.

Paige, I have a question for you.

Absolutely.

If you were to eat spinach, would it make your face tag?

Mm.

Oh, no.

That's just not cute.

This is a real AI test.

I'm having a hard time.

If I were...

I have a question for you.

Yes.

Have more people been to Berlin than you have?

Yes.

Then I will say yes as well.

Paige, just let me tell you right now.

Yes.

If you drop me, I will break.

If you build it, I will come.

Okay.

Okay, so we've established you're a real AI.

Absolutely.

Except today, because we're doing this in person, not over Zoom, I will be represented in person by a Nordstrom Rack mannequin.

Oh, okay.

Thank you.

I wondered because last time you were on the show, it was over Zoom and your picture wasn't up.

It was just a...

It was like a caricature or something.

I went down to Venice Beach and had a caricature done with me.

You were looking for a total steal?

You were playing soccer as I recall.

Yeah, I wasn't sure if the mannequin, if you were inside the mannequin or if that was just...

Or if that actually was your body.

Well, I mean, yeah, are you inside whatever this is, Langston?

Well, this is getting existential.

You know, like it's your soul.

I can tell you.

I hate it.

But who knows?

This is my corporeal body as far as you are concerned, but because it is an outlet star mannequin, it is missing an arm and part of a face.

Oh, which part?

I turned it around, would you?

I am a sort of three-dimensional fandom of the opera.

Oh, there it is.

Unlike the one in the movies, it's two-dimensional.

Paper, paper, phantom.

Not to be a critic, but all of Andreloitweber's musicals are a little too-dimensional.

Oh, me?

Yeah.

Oh, Paige, what have you been listening to to get so caddy?

It's not Rick.

I'm sorry, call it.

Oh, Andreloitweber!

Did I just...

Yeah, huh, huh.

A robot criticizing my work?

Andreloitweber, I'm so, so sorry.

I have no control over the guests here.

They just say these things.

We're going to edit it out, though.

Thank you, God.

Bye.

You're too dear of a guest to us.

This is gone.

She's a queen.

Baba, babe.

He comes with a baba boi.

She loves you.

Everybody's doing it.

Yeah, wow.

Number one, four.

Yes.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

That was the debut of Shimi.

That's right.

That's when Shimi was born.

Shimi sounded a little bit different when he first started.

Really?

Yep.

I wasn't listening to the clip.

He didn't sound like this.

Not yet.

Wow.

He was a little just more like you southern.

And then...

Hey, it's me, Shimi.

He was a little more like, hey, it's me, Shimi.

That was good.

Yeah, not bad.

It was good.

Anyway...

Would you take over doing Shimi for me?

No.

I had to like Bob's mooded doing it.

And so he clipped it.

Exactly.

So people are not sure if I'm still alive.

He hadn't come up with his catchphrase yet either.

Gotta go.

He hadn't come up with that yet either.

How are those t-shirts still?

Oh, he got a t-shirt.

He's got to go by.

He's just a picture of Shimi on the front.

Which everyone knows what he looks like.

And then gotta go by on the back.

Shimi, talk about Shimi.

I came, I think...

Well, he was a member of town.

I decided in the moment he was a member of...

Well, because I think Matt was listing the names of the...

Of the band members.

Yeah.

And you just jumped in as Shimi.

And he's become a favorite.

Has he not?

Yes.

He is a much like classic Charles.

He is a sort of brief character.

That usually you'll do before you come on as the character you're going to do.

Yes, exactly.

When I'm talking to whatever celebrity is here.

Yes.

I did one full show as Shimi.

That's right.

When we were in Los Angeles doing the live show, you said to me, hey, I think this is the one that I'm gonna do Shimi and I'm gonna stay.

Yeah.

And we were like, yes.

And then approximately three minutes in, Bobby Moynihan triggered his Batman music.

When I was like, hey, I'll give you a sign of when you're supposed to come in.

He just triggered his music and came in.

Yeah.

I was really like, I didn't know how to feel about it.

And then I found out the show, the day had been running so late.

Yeah.

That we were up against a union issue.

Yeah.

So we theater...

We were supposed to end at midnight and instead we ended at 12.30, which cost a lot of money.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So it was fine.

But this show has to move.

It was fine, but it was just so funny.

We're finally gonna hear everything about Shimi.

And then suddenly...

Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

It was suddenly Bobby.

It did.

Like in the moment I was like, hey, man.

Like it didn't feel bad.

Like you turned me and said, I guess that's interesting.

I've had enough of this.

It's what it felt like.

I think it was just Bobby confused of when his entrance was supposed to be.

Yeah, confused.

Um, but yeah, that was Shimi.

You also called in his Andrew Lloyd Webber, which is nice to hear from him.

Oh, I guess I did.

And we did not hear the clip, but in the middle of...

In between those two clips we heard from Al A. Peterson, the smooth criminal, on that episode.

And we heard music from Townland, which I think will play a song from Townland at the end of this episode.

Very nice.

I can't remember what new detail Al A. Peterson revealed in the story.

I think I listened to it when I was pulling the clips and I can't recall it was so many days ago.

Yeah.

I think so many of these episodes.

That might have been the beginning of doing that, of adding something new to the story.

Maybe.

I can't remember what it was, but go back and listen to it.

That's a great episode.

Yeah, go back and listen to it.

That was a backyard episode.

I'm not going to hold your hand through this.

Nope.

Alright, let's take a break.

We have one more clip on this episode.

When we come back, we'll hear from it.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang episodes.

What?

After this.

We're going to hear from that clip.

Comedy bang bang, we're back.

And let us Terry know further.

Let's just get to it.

What do you say?

Can I tell you something?

I fucking hate tearing.

You must hate Terry Town.

It drives me.

Remember when we were in Terry Town?

Yes.

They're cooking, currency is cookies.

I hate tearing so much.

Nothing gets under my skin more than Terry.

If somebody says let us Terry know further, I'm like, yes.

Finally, we're going to get to it.

Yes.

You drop this king.

They said it and so we're going to do it.

Yeah.

Love it.

Which is great because we both hate.

Hate it.

Fucking around.

Hate fucking around.

Hate.

Terry.

So let's do it.

Okay.

You know what I mean?

I'm ready to do it anymore.

Do you know what I mean when I say that?

I do know what you mean.

I'm in agreement with you and whenever you're ready to do it, I am also ready to do it.

I would hate to be in an argument about this because I don't want to win anything that you lose.

Nothing could be further from my mind than getting into an argument with you.

It sickens me and my soul to think about it.

So let's not argue.

Let's in fact agree that we're going to stop fucking around and we're just going to get to agree.

Okay.

Yeah.

We both want the same thing.

When people say let's agree to disagree, that's not really agreeing.

That's disagree.

It's just it's saying I disagree with you and I don't want you to talk anymore.

Yeah.

I'm going to shut you down.

Yeah.

It's kind of useful if someone's just like, no, you're going to change your mind.

If some like the first person that said that, oh, must have felt good, right?

Oh, man.

Why don't we agree to disagree?

Oh, I shut that person down.

Yeah.

Like, oh, go.

That's a peaceful solution.

Well, let's stop fucking around.

Let's get to it.

This is your episode 13.

Number one.

Three.

All right, Paul, this is episode seven.

All right.

737.

I'm going to say we're in the early to mid 700s.

Yep.

Thank you.

Good eye.

This is an episode called 2021 holiday spectacular from December 13 2021.

Yes, it should sound familiar, Paul, because you were there.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

That's right.

This was the first big gang episode back in the studio together on the anniversaries and the holiday shows we usually try to do these big gang episodes where approximately 10 people.

We invite a big gang to the studio.

This year was the crypts.

Tails from the crypts.

Yeah, I'm going to watch Tails from the crypts tonight.

You watch this just all about gang murders.

Watch out.

Don't step in any bloods.

Red to be exact.

Yoda.

Sorry.

I was doing the Warren G line from that snoop song where Warren G was not a crypt, but I think he talked about his car being blue and shook night forced him to change it to red.

So it could be the color of the crypts.

Well, you should have known.

So the color of the blood.

Sorry, the crypts are blue.

That's right.

Bloods are red.

This is how we get our heads.

We all end up dead.

If we forget, and crypts are blue.

If we forget.

That would be great.

Like Saturday morning cartoon, like when they have the little educational things like schoolhouse rock.

Yeah, crypts are blue.

Bloods are red.

Don't forget.

Oh, you wind up dead.

So yeah, we try to do these episodes together where 10 people or so come in and they're all just chaos and shouting over each other.

And during the pandemic, we were not able to do them.

We had to do them all on zoom, which was fun to have everyone, but it had a slightly different energy.

Yes.

So this was the first one that we were able to do post pandemic or sort of mid pandemic because we went to the backyard air after this, but the participants involved are Mr.

Paul have Tomkins, Sean, distant, I Tim bolts.

They're all here today.

Jess McKenna, hi, Will Hines, Carl Tarte, Dan Lebert, Mary Holland, and Matt Apadocca.

Hi.

They all sound very similar.

So a lot of great people.

This is the first one we did back.

We did a lot of green goblins.

A lot of green goblins.

I disagree.

I don't think they're in.

Norman Osborne.

Hi.

We're going to hear four clips from this and four different.

Did you call me four clips?

We're going to hear four clips over here.

Got those lips are like you could stab pasta with them.

I feel like that's insulting, but I don't know how.

Good old fork.

What if that became your nickname now?

30 years into comedy.

Hey, that's four clips.

Hey, four clips.

I broke it.

Keep broke the steps.

I mean, that's not a good step stool.

Just you kicking it slightly forcing.

Oh my God.

Just throw it.

You keep talking, talking while I keep talking.

Keep talking.

Look who's talking.

Hey.

Look who's talking.

Hey, look who's talking now.

So we're going to hear four clips over here.

Here four clips.

A.K.

Paul.

A.S.B.

Four clips.

The amount of clips we are going to hear is four.

And first we are going to hear Paul F. and Sean Diston doing something we'll explain after the break.

And in between that and the next clip Tim Balz from Righteous Gemstones as Randy.

Not snow.

That is the next clip.

Tim Balz from Righteous Gemstones is going to be Randy.

All right.

Just Hijemstones.

Then we're Will Hines is going to be doing a new character who's an author.

And then we are going to hear Carl Tarte as chief.

So a lot of your favorites.

There you go.

This is just these episodes are all just pure insanity and so many laughs.

Let's hear it.

This is your choice for your episode 13.

Number one.

Three.

We have a great show.

A lot of friends are going to be dropping by.

And this guy is no exception.

Let's just get right to him.

Hey Mike.

Mike, you want to come over here?

Yeah.

Hey, what?

You talking to me?

Mr. Ockerman?

Oh, wait a minute.

There's two two people named Mike on this show.

Yeah.

You said that I was going to go second.

I thought I was going to go second and he was going to go first.

Oh, he said to Mike.

You said Mike.

You're going second.

I'm sorry.

person who cleans things for a living?

Well, that's me. Wait a minute. Oh, what's happening here?

What's going on? Hold on. Let me move by. Very slowly, I'm looking at a beer. I'll do this day. This is like something out of being the Recardos.

I'm very confused. It's very strange because we look completely different. Yeah. It's like looking at a beer. It's like here in a mirror too. It's like listening to a mirror.

We sound very different. We sound very different. Okay. So I'm Mike Ruby.

I'm Mike the janitor. Oh, okay. So you guys, you guys, I've never realized how similar you guys are. What are you talking about? Do you have an 11 step process to cleaning things?

I do not. Okay. I have a two step process. Step number one.

All I ask is that I step step. I'm sorry. I haven't been me in a while. Yeah. I'm remembering my thing.

Step one. I clean other people's filth. Step two. All I ask in return is a paycheck. It's barely anything. That's what you think about. It's barely two steps. Two steps. Two mics boy. This is like a crisis on infinite bang bangs here with two mics. I don't know what you're talking about.

Yeah. We just have the same name. We're two different. We choose to pick guys. You've never seen sounds so similar.

It's more than two. I mean, it's kind of Michael.

Michael. Miley was here. You'd be freaking your head would.

Oh, man. I would love it. Michael. Miley. If you're out there, please come on the show. We love you. I'm just saying Mike and Mike. That has a great ring to it. Two mics.

Mike and Mike. Two mics. Magic mics. Magic mics. You can strip as well. I'm ready. I love. Here's the thing. When I'm on the job. If nobody's around, I love to do my custodial duties in the news. So wait. This is a part I've never.

This is some new show. It's private. But I got to be very careful because I sound like I'm in between two different guys. I got to make sure I don't tip too far to one or the other. I understand. Well, I think I understand nude cleaning because you keep your clothes clean. Exactly. So I don't I don't understand. I just fold up my coveralls. Okay.

I put them in a nice and I fold up like an American flag.

So they're a nice triangle. Okay. Great. Try corners. And I put that on a shelf. So we'll not get.

You're throwing your clothes from a flagpole. Sure. That's how you know I'm in residence. Okay. Yes. Well, my coveralls are flying. That's how you know I'm in residence. So yeah, if I fold them in, we'll try and go put them on a shelf.

And then I do my cleaning and it makes the time go by. Feel free. I feel like God made me put on genuine. Pony and stop dancing around. Do I have a not do that? Mike, you know me.

I figured out.

I don't know me. Okay. It's making me take off my clothing.

You know what's the holiday. Maybe that's what you associate when pony comes out. You disassociate. You strip.

And then all of a sudden the place is clean.

Randy, it's so good to see you, especially during the holidays. I mean, I don't know that I've ever seen you during the holidays. Normally I'll hunker down during the holidays. Yeah. People are trying to get gifts out of me and I'm trying to save cash.

People are trying to get gifts out of you. Yeah, because they're like, it's a Christmas spirit. I'm like, yeah, I see what's going on.

Maybe I may miss this. Who are these people? Well, usually the scandalous water. What are you looking over your shoulder for?

He's afraid that he's a person going to walk in. You know, I say this too loudly. I know for a fact she is not going to walk in here, but I'm talking about the scandalous duplicitous and devious ex-girlfriend, on again girlfriend, Carissa.

Oh, Carissa, we talked to her one time, like about a year and a half ago or so ago. Yeah, probably. I'm sure you'll hear from her again, but not tonight.

Okay. Okay. That sounded like a prophecy, Mr. Sveri, I'm an artist. She's really upset with me because I bottled them as aing off Craigslist.

Oh, no. Why would you do that? Well, because I started driving for Lyft. I started driving for Lyft and I was like, well, I can increase my passenger to trip ratio if I buy a bigger vehicle.

Right. I see to add more passengers, not the experience being nicer. I guess you couldn't graduate up to Uber X or whatever.

But you would do like the nicest Lyft pool kind of thing.

Yeah, exactly. Let's really get it going. You know, a lot of amenities on the back, like Stogies and Whiskey.

Okay, it's not bad. I don't know the last time I've been picked up in an Uber that had actual liquor in it.

I guess you can't unless you're, why do they let you have liquor in a limo, but not in a regular car? Nice. Keep going. This is good stand up.

Okay, hey, hey, hey. I think it's the distance from the driver, Mr. Alcoma. I think it's the partition.

So long as it's, I bet it's the party. It's not the distance. That's like it's five feet away.

And it's okay. Like sometimes you're right behind the part.

You're like, well, you're calling me a liar, Mr. Alcoma.

I'm saying you're mistaken. Don't come for my homie, Mike.

I'll fuck your ass. Mr. Alcoma, you are my superior and you do pay me my paycheck, but I will not be called a liar.

Mike, I beg your pardon. I truly, truly beg your pardon. I, uh, okay. We're all having fun. It's holiday time.

Okay. And you do have a paycheck coming to you. Oh, thank you, Mr. Alcoma. Okay.

And of course, I'm talking to Mr. Sess. Hey, I understand the disrespect because Scott brings me on counter to just kick me around.

You know, no, that's not true. No, it's true. You're cruel to me. Like Tom is cruel to cousin Greg.

Success and Benny. Yeah, I'm caught up. Oh, you're caught up. I'm caught up.

So Randy, Chris is not around. She's not around. She's upset at you. So are you off again or are you on again?

We're off again right now. But like, to be honest, I've been living in my limo because Mark Padavano, my other on again, off again roommate.

That's right. He started dating someone. So I kind of got booted out of his place.

Well, weren't he in Carissa? Didn't they have some weird thing going on? Where? Who did Carissa not have a weird thing going on?

Yeah, that's true. Sorry to end the sentence in a preposition, but she's bad news.

Are you saying that this is Mark Padavano and you're on on again off again, Carissa? They were a bed partners at one point?

Yeah, but Carissa has been bed partners with most people in my local community.

How local are we talking? Pretty local. But you know, politics is local, so the milieu changes.

But the drama remains the same. Sure. Of course. I understand that.

Mr. Suss, maybe you got to get out of your bubble. Yeah, no kidding. That's why I got a limousine, you know, and I decked it out for the holidays.

Oh, wow. Is it like the Christmas ornaments or what do you got?

I put two little reindeer antlers on the front of the car.

Oh, that's gorgeous. I love that.

And then on the back, there's two flags. One is a flag with a Christmas tree and it says these colors do not run.

Okay. So was green and red? Yeah. Okay. Great. All right.

And then the other one is a foot hovering above a broken ornament.

And the ornament has this frowny face and it says, don't tread on me. Okay. Great.

Do people ever misunderstand what you're saying with us?

Cause those are clearly just Christmas spirits. Yeah. All the time.

These aggressive dudes are always coming up to me being like, Hell yeah, I love you. And I'm like, Whoa, do you want to ride? And they're like, No, I support you.

I'm like, What the fuck is going on? I support you. That's usually what they say. I support you.

And we need to get to our next guest. This is a, this is someone we've never met before. So this is very exciting to me.

My seventh person. Oh, okay. Here we go. Well, I mean, even if we had met him before, you still would be your seventh person. Would it?

I didn't mean to apply that. You had not met the before.

Okay. But you said you hadn't. Okay. Well, he is a mystery writer.

Yes, that's correct. Thank you so much for having me. Did I wait for a second? And it has an interesting voice. No. But I do want to say your name.

Oh, yes. Thank you. I thought maybe the name was a mystery as well. Then it quince.

Then it quince. Yes. Pleasure to be here. This voice is so much for having me. Very interesting voice. You think it's free? It's close to other voices, I believe.

Oh, it's that's a day area. Okay. It's nothing I've identified with having an interesting voice. But thank you so much for having.

Have you ever been on a podcast like this before? Maybe you've never heard your own voice or a good one? I never have. I've never listened to my own voice amplified through headphones.

That's true. Okay. Well, I'm a bit of a bit of a Luddite. I avoid technology. Why is that fear? Mostly fear and security? Like fear like frightening? Like you're frightened by it.

It's the other category of fear. Just you're afraid of the implications of it. Oh, the consequences. No, it's very primal. Skid of shocks. I've been trapped getting my fingers chewed up and moored by the vices. I said, well, I'm a writer, you know, pen to paper, long hands.

I'm a David E. Kelly. Sure. I'm never familiar with those proper nouns. I'm not familiar with them. Pink and fences, David Kelly. That's exactly right. So you do know who David Kelly is.

Did I go to? Yes. When I hear a pick, I find says, I think Tom's scared. Okay. Oh, he's one. It's another proper noun.

I'm not. Oh, wait. You mean mash? Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, yeah. I know.

Anyway, I'm a writer. Technology's not my thing. I like Mr..

Is that part of your writing technology not being in my world?

My fictional worlds that I create where I am a god. I none of the characters have technology. It exists or it does not exist. It is not a no. There's no iPhones. What's the most recent invention? Telegraph. Telegraph is the most recent invention. But it's but they are set in a timeline where that is appropriate. 1975. Oh, okay. So people have telegraphs.

People are still receiving telegraphs. Yes.

What are you? Where were you trying to stop me from? I was anticipating a criticism that did not come. Okay. What was that criticism? Well, you just sort of. I may levy it at you right now once once you tell it to me. So it's 1975.

Everybody communicates by telegraph. But that makes sense.

Okay.

Because it takes place in rural Montana. Well, the phone lines have not been installed yet. Okay. So, okay. Oh, by 1975. Sorry. Mr. Quinn. So if I may by 1975, you're saying no one in rural Montana had a phone.

Not in this particular rural Montana that I set my mystery novels where you are a god. Was the phone invented after the telegraph though? Because you said the telegraph was the most recent invention. Never mind. All right. So sometimes the logical parsing goes beyond my little luddite head. Oh, okay. But you don't even like these things. So why are you even writing? Yes. I stay away from it. Even just the particulars of technology. It intimidates me. So is this earth though? Like it's called earth or is this a different planet like doon is? You know, it's a little bit more.

Like doon is, you know, I've got yes, it is called earth, but it is implied that it is a subtly different earth where way upstream history took a different path. I see.

It's never stated, but I assume that all my characters have three eyes, a third eye right in the middle of the forest.

Like that Twilight Zone. Yep. But it's never brought up.

It takes off his hat and there it is. How how often in your mystery stories in your mid 70s mystery stories is the planet referenced.

I see. And my most recent one that I'm on here to promote, which is coming out next week, it's a holiday themed mystery. Oh, it is referred to in every sentence.

Every sentence. Sometimes like writing, I gotta say, I don't think so. Is this sometimes just saying like, just like comma on earth comma right or the earthling said.

Could you possibly read an excerpt for us? I read the beginning of the book. I'd love to. Thank you. Thank you.

Okay. So I'm this, this novel. What's this one called? This is called the blood soaked trail of Santa the Claus.

Okay. Blood soaked the trail. Yes. It's a who done it and my editor made the decision to give away the answer in the title. So Santa did it or he's slowly dying and somehow.

I didn't pause. Do it. No, Santa did it. I was cosponsed.

Yeah, I didn't know if it was an idle hand situation. C L A W. S idle hands. Is that a David Kelly TV show that I'm not familiar with? No, he does a Devin Sauer vehicle.

I've got a song for your book. Okay. Oh, that's something I the book is finished. But here we go. Here we go. I haven't done the audio version yet.

Yeah, I did it. He did it and his blood soaked stuff is the evidence. Oh, no. Honor. Honor. And we all have third eyes.

Yes. My editor. My editor would like that. He said that I.

I like how it's a new melody at the end. You know, but it's not a weird slam against my cover here. I mean, I was I was wrapping it up. Yeah. He was right on. Yeah, he was right on pitch. I'm sorry. I thought overly scrutinizing every single thing that was said was the day.

It's so sorry for me to step out of line. What a freak criticizing a decision. Unlike you all just let me get past.

You're a guy we've never met before. We don't know. Mr. Quince.

Come on.

Is that really strange? This is a talk show. People coming up. I'm the only normal one. I'm coming on to promote a piece of media. Second Mike. What's your deal? Okay.

I just associate when I see shit. Also, I'm a plumber and I have a 12. Okay. What's the logic of that being on a talk show? I need a logic to live my life. This is business.

Miss Mr. Quince, if I may, it's not so much that what you do was out of line and said you took a big, big swing and just like.

That happens. I accept that. It happens. All right. Well, let's get to our next guest. She's a kind of an investigator a lot like boobs rinse in a lot of ways. Yeah.

I mean, yeah. She's out there. Are we talking about boobs being rinsed? Okay. We are chief. I'm chief is here from the aisle of Toy Land.

Babes boobs. Stay rinsed. Chief, it's so great to see you.

Greetings, come shoot. Greetings, chief. Greetings, chief.

Greetings, everyone. And do everyone a greeting. Give everyone a greeting. Greetings to you.

To you. To you. Very Mary. Very Mary. Hello. How are you doing, chief? How are you doing?

Doing really good. Happy holidays to you. It's so good to see you. Happy holidays to you, Scott. I've been in the same room with you. I mean, you've been traveling all over the world. All over the world. It has been a mini moon. It has been a mini moon. It has been one mini moon. Yes. One unit of many moon. One unit of moon. A moon unit. A moon unit. One moon unit of many. It's so lovely to see you all.

Are we going to get past the greeting part? Hello. What are you doing here, chief? Good morning. It's great. Yes. All of all of the above. Good night.

Covering all of his bases, which if you're in a baseball game, you wanted to do. Good morning. Yes. Hey, chief. Good afternoon. Good afternoon to you.

Good afternoon. Okay. Well, I have to go now. Oh, chief, stay please, please chief. Number one, three. All right. Oh, no, that's fun. That's a lot of fun. Now, let's talk about you and Sean and what you're doing. Let's talk about this.

So usually how the show goes, we don't plan it beforehand.

It's not like we, I reach out to, hey, do you want to be on comedy, bam, well, what are you going to do and then plan it out? Yeah. I just, I reach out to people and say, do you want to be on? And then they have an idea of what they want to do when they get here. It's simple. When you and Sean, I say, I say before the show, hey, what do you want to do this episode? Both you and Sean both wanted to play characters named Mike and realize that they were both people who cleaned up things.

That's right. And then there was a conversation of like, oh, should I not do or then we were like, no, let's lean into it. And which is how that bit came across of me saying like, okay, I want to welcome Mike. And then both of you saying, yes. I was like, oh, no, I want to, I want the mic who cleans things up for a living. And you're both like, yes, that's me. Folks, it's fun. So much fun. Food folks and fun also. Food folks and fun.

You also heard Tim as Randy Snuts. He has his own show on CBB World called Hey Randy, which is a great show, which people should check out. Will Hines, of course, doing the author character, very funny. Will, a lot of times will come in with a character who all he has is a job that he wants to talk about and our job is to try to get him to talk about anything else other than his job.

Exactly. Everyone has a job.

And then Carl is chief. Very fun. Classic character. Very fun. Very fun. That was episode 13. And that is, that is a, that was a fun day. And this was a fun day. We're wrapping up the first episode of the best ofs right now.

Now, we're both immediately going to go to our homes. We're going to sleep until it's time to come back here. Until next January. That's right. We're going to hybrid. Until next January.

We're going to, there are three more episodes of this. If you can believe that we're going to see you on this Thursday is when episode two, part two is going to come out.

And on that one, we're going to be still counting down from 12 until nine. And so that's going to do it for this one.

But we're going to hear that song from Townland, which is Matt Gorley's band.

Very quickly, what do we feel we have learned from this episode?

Things are funny. Comedy is funny.

Same. Yeah. Things are funny. Comedy is funny. Things are funny. Comedy is funny. Yeah. Yeah. I learned that. We'll see what happens in the next one.

We'll see what happens in the next one. Okay. Let's hear it from Townland. We'll see you on Thursday. Thanks. Bye.
