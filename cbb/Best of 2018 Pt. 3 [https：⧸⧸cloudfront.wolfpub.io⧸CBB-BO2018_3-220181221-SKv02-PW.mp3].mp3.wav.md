♪♪♪ You put the lime in the coconut, you put the coconut in the trash, you go to the freakin' doctor like a normal person, Kyle, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Thank you to Colfax-McLivernet for that catheteration.

Oh, one second Colfax-McLivernet.

Yes, our old friend Colfax-McLivernet, yes sir.

The doctor is the one who told him to put the l- The doctor is a coconut.

What is that older adult?

The doctor is the one who advised him to put the lime in the coconut.

And so to say, go to the doctor, oh, because the way, why does the doctor say to put a lime in a coconut as some sort of medicinal purposes?

Yeah, look, the doctor's incompetent.

That's neither here nor there.

This is- This doctor should be the moral of the story.

Yes, this presupposes that this person came up with this as a home remedy.

Uh-uh, not true.

No, not on my watch.

No, universal healthcare single payer now.

Lock her up too.

Lock her up.

Hi everyone, if you've never heard the show before.

Goodbye.

That's about as political as we get.

Uh, welcome to the show.

This is Comedy Bang Bang, the best of 2018 Part 3.

Yeah, man.

And it is New Year's Eve.

Oh, can you- I can- Scott?

I can smell- What do you smell?

What's going on in the studio today?

I can smell toast.

Oh no!

My left arm is tingling.

Oh, goodbye Paul!

See you on the other side.

I can smell romance in the air.

Oh, that's right.

A lot of people will be smooching tonight.

This is the number one kissing holiday.

You would think it would be Valentine's Day?

No.

No, people are tired of each other.

And people- you don't have to kiss each other on Valentine's Day.

No.

New Year's Eve at the stroke of midnight, you must kiss.

You must kiss.

No, someone tries to kiss you?

You must submit.

You must accept it.

Submit.

Ha ha.

Have you, uh, ever had a New Year's Eve kiss that was?

Uhm, kiss that was unexpected or welcome or, uh, uh, have you ever been to a party?

And the food was just no- Oh!

Um, no, I remember- I'm so sorry to bring this out.

Well, I remember being a big deal when I was younger to have a kiss on New Year's Eve.

So like, the way it was sold to us in the mainstream media- Lame-stream media, I call it.

Of course, uh, was that you go to a party with a bunch of randos- You know what?

I want to call it the cream-stream media.

Cause it's crazy, like Kramer.

Or the crayon-stream media because like- It's like the- Crazy-strain- Crazy-strain- It's crayon- Yeah, it's crayon- Yes.

So- First gate couple of television.

They were married, right?

No, I know Midnight is when Happy New Year.

I'm saying when- No, no, no, no.

We're saying- We're on the same side.

Okay.

I'm saying- As soon as that minute hand hits the 12- That's when they start the 12- Everyone goes- That's when they start the 12-bongs, but everyone goes crazy at Bong No. 1.

That's what I- So- So at Big Ben- At Big Ben?

Three bongs at Big Ben.

Oh man.

Can you imagine having three bongs at Big Ben?

Three bongs at Big Ben?

Oh, fuck.

We're total potheads.

You can tell from our accurate rendition- I love doing potthru-a-bong.

So it's at the- So you don't waitin' for the 12.

It's at the first one, is when the time is.

Yeah, because you've done a countdown already.

Well, I know the countdown all the time- It's not- I'm not saying you don't know these things.

God damn it!

Big Ben, you're in England.

It's got your fighting me at every turn.

You're- I think we're saying the same thing, but I want to get hyper-specific.

I'm trying to, and you keep shitting me down.

You're in England.

You hear Big Ben go- You have your- You get your passport.

You get- You probably have to do that.

Yes.

It's very strict.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You have the idea to go there.

No, before that.

You hear about it.

Your parents meet.

Before that, before that, Jesus.

Your mother, Jesus is born.

Jesus is born.

Saves everybody.

Before that even.

Keep man.

Just go to fire.

Shiny.

But at Big Ben, it's three o'clock.

Big Ben goes, bong, and it's going to do two more.

You know it's three o'clock right when they go bong.

Yeah.

Not bong bong.

But you still have to wait out the other two.

Sure.

Tilly, yeah, stay there, go fucking dumbass.

So say you wake up.

You don't know what time it is.

You don't have a phone on you.

You don't have a clock.

Suddenly you hear bong.

If it's midnight, you're going to have to wait to know what truly what time it is.

It's going to be 12- or it's going to be 12-01, 12-01 and a half by the time you figure this out.

Can I tell you something Scott?

I've lived this exact experience.

No.

We have in our home a coco clock.

It's in the living room.

You can hear it from the bedroom.

Sure.

Oh, thank God.

So in the morning...

So wait, this thing is going off all night?

No, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.

It goes to sleep itself when the lights are out.

It goes to sleep itself.

When the lights are out?

Yes.

It has a light sensor.

Okay.

So it knows not all sensors operating at the efficiency.

If you're taking a nap and you leave the light on, much like Motel 6, or is sunlight?

Or much like Joe Kocker advised us to.

Sure.

With his hats.

Is sunlight on it?

So during the afternoon, is it always on?

Like at the crack of dawn, is it on?

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

So if you're trying to sleep in, or you're trying to take a nap in the middle of the day, it'll be going off like crazy.

It's not so loud in the bedroom that it would wake you up in the morning.

Right.

So...

Like I've never, I've never like always done it 6 a.m. like that.

That's fucking clock.

Okay.

You wake up.

But based on actual events.

Wow.

Okay.

So this is based on some IP.

I'm comfortable with it.

I wake up.

I hear the cuckoo start to sing his merry hours.

Yeah.

So he's a merry song.

That's not just natural cuckoo clock listening.

This is classic natural cuckoo clock listening.

Now, here's what you must know about modern cuckoo clocks.

Modern cuckoo clocks, okay.

And I know this because I know other people have cuckoo clocks.

I'm not saying we're in a club.

Sure.

We're not.

But that's why I'm not saying that.

But the cuckoo clock community is small enough that you just gradually get to know.

The triple C, you know other people.

Right.

You begin to notice certain signs like they have a peat clock.

They have bags under their eyes.

They can't sleep.

They seem to be counting in their heads a lot.

There's a sort of monopoly on the sound and the actual cuckoo itself.

So the clocks are all different.

Got it.

But the cuckoo itself, this white plastic cuckoo that comes out, he hears what he will do.

He comes out of his little hole.

Right.

Almost as if he's being birthed.

It's a lot like the birth canal.

Well, he comes out so fast.

It's like he's rushing like he was late to get there.

Right.

He's checking his watch.

His hair is must.

He's like, oh fuck.

Oh fuck.

Cuckoo.

I love it.

Please.

I would love it.

If you are a cuckoo clock maker, please make one where the cuckoo comes out and goes, oh fuck.

For the first one.

And then the rest of them it's fine.

SOP.

The first one should always be like, I just got here.

Oh fuck.

So what happens is this cuckoo, he comes out, he says cuckoo, he like bends down and his wings flap up.

Right.

He makes a big show out of this.

Yeah.

Oh boy.

So he's bending over?

He like bows.

He bows to whom?

Cuckoo to you.

You're the master of the house.

Pretend to you.

So our neighbors have a cuckoo clock, completely different clock.

Same cuckoo, same sound.

It's what it's a natural recording of a cuckoo, but it's a recording of a real bird.

The recording of a real bird.

Voice blocks.

Yes.

And then they instantly echoes slightly quieter.

It sounds like it's further away.

So it goes cuckoo.

It goes like this.

Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

And this is not your, you're not hearing the echo, meaning you're hearing your neighbors coo.

No, I thought about that.

Okay.

And so I stood in the street between our two houses.

And all you heard was cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

So I think it's to let you, it's to help you count the cuckoos.

The echo is to help you get the cuckoos?

Yes.

Somehow, does that make sense?

I don't know, but it works.

It actually works.

So without an echo, you would get unable to count these cuckoos.

Well, no, of course you could.

But there's something about the echo that keeps you cemented in where, in the count.

Okay.

I don't know.

I can't explain it.

But same, so two different clocks, same cuckoo, same sound.

How odd.

Yeah.

And then I got one for my office.

Okay.

From a, from a, from a third other place, same cuckoo, same sound.

Well, it sounds to me like cuckoo clocks, there are so few of them that they, there's maybe one place that does the cuckoos.

But when you search online for cuckoo clocks, you can't believe how many, how many varieties?

There's so many.

So then how did you end up in such close proximity finding these same cuckoo in these three different places?

This is insane.

This is my question.

How deep does this go?

All the way up.

It goes so deep, it goes all the way up.

And, and have you, you think this is interesting to anyone?

I don't know.

But let's continue.

Do you and your neighbor ever talk about this?

Have you ever said, Hey, same cuckoo?

Oh, we've talked about it.

Really?

So you're on speaking terms with your neighbor.

Yes.

That's good.

Yes.

And was the first, no topics are off the table.

Good.

So just like laying it out there.

Yeah.

I remember saying to her, can I ask you a question about cuckoo clock?

And I was, I was really tense.

I was like, she was going to say, how dare you?

How?

Yes.

I'm a married woman.

You're a married man.

And this is inappropriate.

But instead she said, Paul, you can ask me anything.

Yeah.

And she's hoping maybe that you ask her something kind of inappropriate about.

Yeah.

I mean, she's married.

Well, I eventually did.

Okay.

So you got first I asked about the cuckoo clock.

Then I said, what do you look like nude?

She said, kind of frumpy.

She had to describe.

Scott.

I don't know this person.

Have I told you this story?

Cuckoo clocks.

Cuckoo clocks get at us.

Text one for three and two for yes.

I had a neighbor who was crazy and collected them.

And it was a little on the nose.

Collecting them is a bit much.

Yeah.

She had a lot.

Yeah.

She had them all in her bathroom.

She.

Yeah.

She literally the first day I met her.

She came over and announced who she was and told me that half of her brain had been taken out.

Wow.

Yeah.

She was famously she when she was showing cool up her my wife cool up her.

Oh, that's just for some reason.

I thought this was like when you were a kid.

This is modern day.

This is modern day when she was showing cool up her place.

She went into the bathroom and pulled the shower curtain and her entire bathtub was filled with kitty litter.

Oh my God.

And barf.

Oh my God.

And then she opened up the closet and hanging inside just on several hangers were baby clothes.

And she said, I don't have children, but I like their clothes.

And at that point cool up new she had to get the fuck out.

Oh my God.

Does she live alone this person?

She I believe she eventually moved out to live with her mother after vandalizing several of our places.

Long story.

How old was she?

She was probably 15 years older than I if I had to guess.

What a weird thing to say.

Why wouldn't you just say old she?

Because she moved away so long ago that I can't I can't handicap it now.

Okay.

So then I was this age.

So hard she was 15 years old now, but I mean it was about 15 years ago.

So who knows?

So she was 30.

I don't know.

This happened when you were baby.

Yes.

She was 15 years old.

That place someday I'll tell you the story of all my crazy neighbors, but quite a menagerie pass through.

When I say something, I also don't have kids and I also do like their clothes.

You do.

But I haven't bought any.

That separates me from her.

What are you doing?

Just going by the elementary schools and checking them out or how do you.

I'm looking in the window at baby gap.

Sorry.

I don't know what your delivery system to your eyes is.

Stare you.

What can I see you nude?

You are.

Take off your three glasses.

Why have you been wearing those this whole time?

I was hoping your penis would come straight.

No, it did.

Will, if you take off the glasses.

Oh, gosh.

Paul of Tonkins is here.

Yeah.

My name is Scott Ockerman.

I don't know whether I mentioned who we are.

I don't know that anyone knows.

Do you think anyone who had no idea who we are, listen to any of that?

Do you think that would be interesting?

It would.

Would it not?

Someone was like, I was told to check this out.

And then it's just two randos.

I'm going to start right here.

Two randos, which everyone hates.

Right.

Just talking about something.

You don't know who they are.

They're talking about it.

They're filing it to a crazy person.

Great.

Oh, good.

I'm locked in.

I'm jacked in.

I heard comedy bang bang is about crazy people.

Look how sad Chewbacca looks on this box of tissues.

Okay.

We have a box of tissues in the room and it's Star Wars themed.

Yeah.

And I believe stormtroopers are an approximately 75% of the stormtrooper.

There's Kylo Ren.

Is that Kylo Ren?

And it's our old friend, Baldroy.

Oh, Baldroyd.

Hello, Baldroyd.

Who's on the bottom?

In the bottom, Baldroyd.

It looks like Venom.

Now, and then Chewbacca.

And then Chewbacca.

Look at Evelyn's.

On top where the Kleenexes come out, they're just...

He looks just anguished.

I believe TIE fighters and X-wings.

Yeah.

And TIE fighters and X-wings.

TIE...

You know what life is?

It's a bunch of TIE fighters and X-wings.

You ever noticed that the TIE fighters and X-wings are sort of like the X's and O's on tic-tac-toe?

Or like kisses and hugs?

Yes.

You ever think TIE fighter like signed off on one of his letters?

Just like TIE fighter X-wing.

TIE fighter X-wing.

Darth.

Did you get that grandma target?

Grandma Tarkin.

Why, how come they dropped Grand Moff as a title?

I think they still use it in some of them.

Maw?

Really?

Maw is...

That's not an English thing, right?

It's something he made up.

I believe it's something...

One of his great make-em-ups?

One of his great make-em-ups.

Like a good Skywalker.

Yeah.

Well, everyone else's name in that...

Now of course, when Solo came out this year, we learned that it wasn't just a shitty name George Lucas came up for him, that he picked it because he was alone.

Right.

So it makes more sense.

It's kind of a sign to him.

Yeah.

Well, yeah.

Did someone say like, I'll just call you Solo because you're alone?

I think he said I'm Solo and then the person wrote it down, but he didn't mean it as a name.

Right.

Something like that.

Classic part of the movies.

Here's a part I want to talk about.

Yeah.

There's a robot who's like robots or slaves.

They should have free will.

That's right.

That's part of this.

And everyone's like, ha ha ha ha.

Then that robot frees a bunch of other robots.

Right.

Yes.

You know, change...

Like there's some restriction in robots that makes them slaves.

So something in their programming or like a chip or a bar or something like that?

Yeah.

Wasn't there some sort of restraining bar on R2D2 in the first one?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Like I took out as a restraining bolt.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And then he went on to Thrupio.

Right.

So they couldn't run away.

Yeah, he had one like a third nipple like Marky Mark.

Right.

Then...

So then this robot frees all these other robots.

Okay.

And then we just forget about that idea.

That happens in the past in the Star Wars universe.

So nowadays when Luke Skywalker, great name, has this restraining bolt on C3PO in R2D2, he's not considered to be a slaver or anything.

Well even when they take off the restraining bolt and they're just hanging out as his friends, I guess they choose to do this?

Yeah, after I've seen C3PO is like, it's not that he's programmed to do this.

It's like, well this is my job.

Yeah, at a certain point, I mean...

I care about it.

They crash landed on Tatsuene.

And when he takes out the restraining bolt, you think it would be like, Goodbye, Mosluke!

I'm off to the spaceports!

Yeah.

Gotta get back to the rebel voices.

I have a wife and children.

What have you had in family somewhere?

Do robots fuck?

That's what we're getting to.

That's what we're all thinking.

Do you think that C3PO and R2D2 are fun?

I mean R2D2 has all those attachments that come out of that hole.

They have the energy of people that used to be a couple.

Yeah, like thousands and thousands of years ago when they were first built.

That's right.

They were a couple and they tried it for like three years, which is a long time.

Yeah, yeah.

When you're that centuries old, maybe it's not a long time in the span of it.

Are they supposed to be centuries old?

I feel like they were...

I mean they're outdated models, I think, aren't they?

Oh, that's too bad.

Anytime anyone sees one of them, they're like, what do you have that old hunk of junk fly?

That's a space museum.

Right.

But it seems a little weird that they would just throw them in a trash pile, especially if it was still on and screaming.

Yee!

But...

Do you have to do screams?

Does he feel pain?

I guess.

You know?

Yeah.

Oh, there's a one robot.

I was just reminded of this during a supergo session.

A robot gets his feet burned.

Oh, yeah.

Like a job as palace or something.

And they're just going, like, brand his feet and he screams bloody murder.

So I guess they have feelings or they're programmed to react as if they have feelings.

It might be bad.

And that's fucked up.

Yeah.

And if you're in this robot that if it ever gets burned on its feet, it will...

It will scream.

By the way, engineer Sam has texted us both.

A moth is a regional governor of star systems.

Moth Tarkin is the first to be awarded the title by Emperor Palpatine.

Oh, okay.

By the way, Palpatine is named Palpatine because he so easily gets your heart palpitating.

You give my heart the Palpatine's.

Like everyone.

I got the Palpatine.

Your look is so lazy.

He's like, this kid wants to go fly around in a spaceship or call him Skywalker.

This lady.

This guy's a loner.

So I'll call him solo.

This lady's a live show.

Her name's Organ.

Exactly.

Should the only thing she's good for is being alive.

This guy's a whole.

This guy's a weirdo.

He's Obi Kenobi.

How does that one work?

Kenobi.

Obi-Wan.

He's one guy.

Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Obi-Wan.

Obi Kenobi.

Kenobi.

If this were a music.

Kenobi.

I would be so happy if life was a musical that no one had ever unlocked and just saying that it happened.

Like all of a string.

Yeah.

And then we just start dancing on the table doing a soft shoe.

Obi Kenobi.

Kenobi.

And then it happened for everyone because we were the first.

And they had no.

But would they have any, would people like it?

I don't know.

Not everybody's us.

Not everyone is into musicals.

I would love it if suddenly I had the ability to tap dance and just soft shoe the way that and the way to dance like Gene Kelly.

Do you think that the people, because these are just regular people in these musicals, they should not have years of dance training.

They all have other jobs.

No.

So by one guy he's an American American American American American American.

So when a musical number comes into a musical, you are basically being transported there.

Something takes over their body and gives them the ability to do these dances.

Like in La La Land.

Yes.

Exactly.

So they are, they're being basically possessed by some sort of spirit, be it evil, be it good.

Be it evil, be it good.

So I would love that if suddenly because I, you know, as someone who tried to do musicals when I was growing up, I always hated the dance part.

Me too.

And even though I did, I did learn how to tap and I was in Chicago and I tapped and tapped occasionally in some of the other shows, I'm not the most expressive dancer.

So if something were to take over my body during a musical number that was happening in real life, I would love that.

I'd be like, Holy shit, I just tap danced expertly.

No texts from Sam about that.

Um, what is this?

Someone taking over my spirit of dance taking over your body.

All right.

Well.

Uh, my, have you ever had the, the, the fantasy that you would learn to do something in secret and then you'd bust it out at a party or something?

Yeah.

Piano.

Me too.

Piano and dance are the two things.

Yeah.

Well, I truly believe that if you, because your, uh, your birthday party was this year, that was a great time and you came out and, uh, sang, uh, the Petchot Boys, it's a sin with a big band.

Yeah.

And, uh, and I remember turning to cool up going, Petchot Boys, you like, because she always makes fun of me.

When I listen to the Petchot Boys, anytime they come on, she's like, the Petchot Boys, I'm like, that was good.

This is the Petchot Boys.

She's like, I know you like Paul.

So, but in any case, I think that if you worked, had worked for a year, once a week, just once a week took a, took a dance thing.

Mm hmm.

I mean, look at the people on dancing with the stars.

Our friend Nikki Glaser was on this year and she was only on one episode.

Yeah.

But I'm sure she had to do that in just like a week.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It had to put that together with a person who knows what they're doing.

Yeah, yeah.

I bet if like you did one day a week for a year, you could do like an amazing choreographed dance.

This is the most serious I've ever gotten about it.

I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

I think it might happen.

When, when will you, okay, don't, don't tell me because I wanted to be a surprise.

I'm not going to tell you.

What if it was here on the show?

The next episode.

Yeah.

Whoa!

I would love to play piano though.

Yeah.

You know, I remember going over to Jack McBrier's house once and he had started taking lessons and I was like, wow, I've always, I've always kind of assumed it was too late for me.

But here's Jack.

He's, he's just started taking lessons maybe a year earlier and he played me some stuff on the piano and was like, that's how you do it.

And I saw him the other night.

I said, how's the piano company?

He's like, oh, I don't do that anymore.

Yeah!

I still have a piano on my house.

You know, my mother took, started taking piano lessons when she was in her 50s.

Really?

Yes.

Okay.

How did she end up?

Well, she didn't end up so well because we all made fun of her because we're not good people.

And she, but she tried it for a while and she, I remember one Thanksgiving, my, she was demonstrating her progress for our family and my cousins and she was trying to play when the Saints go marching in.

Let me see if I can hum that.

Okay.

Yeah.

Got it.

So she was playing like this.

Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, so she was taking a lot of it right now.

Very short thing.

Yeah.

And then my cousin Steven said, that's great.

All he need now is a singer who stutters.

That's like a classic vaudeville joke.

Wow.

Yaberns.

Yaberns, mom.

Yabernt.

How did she ever recover?

Well, she didn't know she died.

Oh, that's right.

I forgot it.

She died from that.

You've never talked about it.

I mean, I have no proof that she didn't die from that.

She died of shame.

A mere 30 years later.

Well, I would love to learn.

Tell you what, if I learn how to play piano, I'll accompany you and you're.

There we go.

This is perfect.

What type of dance do you want to do?

I want to tap dance.

Tap dance.

Great.

You can do it.

I think I can do it.

It's a fun.

It is fun and you don't have to use too much of your upper body, which is.

Well, I can't.

You don't have to parallelize with the waist up.

Yeah, I did.

I didn't know that.

My legs work like crazy.

You just bend it over backwards the entire time.

Yeah, yeah.

I have to swing my arms up on a table to make it look natural.

Oh, Paul, that's not true, I hope.

It's probably not true.

Paul, we have to get to it.

We have to get to it.

I'll tell everyone what we're doing this episode.

Enough grab ass.

We are counting down the top 14 episodes of the year of Comedy Bang Bang late November through late November of this year, but we call it 2018.

We're counting down the top 14 in our previous episodes.

Go listen to those if you haven't yet.

Our previous episodes we- It's my wish for you.

Go listen to those.

We counted down from 14 through 7.

That's right.

14 through 7.

Today we are going to be listening to the number six episode, the number five episode, and the number four episode.

Holy shit.

Things are heating up here.

I mean, they're getting hot and spicy.

They really are.

I mean, it's getting exciting.

Sweaty and hot.

What is that from?

That's a solid, Alan.

Is Alan Thix saying it?

Oh, Thix saying it's not a sweat.

Did he write it?

I mean, probably.

Probably.

He was a big songwriter.

It could have thought he found somewhere.

Like someone else wrote it and discarded it?

Yeah.

Like he's walking on the street just the other day and he finds the song.

He's not pretty late.

You know what I'm saying?

He said he found a song.

Yeah.

He sang it on some TV special.

Sweaty and hot.

It was all about the workout craze.

Oh, remember that?

Remember how it was so weird in the 80s that anyone was working out?

Yeah.

That people had to talk about it.

Yeah.

I got to write a song.

Let's get physical.

Physical.

So no one before they never worked out, I guess.

Nope.

Well, you had the, you know, that sort of big rubber band that would shake you.

Sure.

But everyone says, I think what it was was everyone basically ate sensibly.

Yeah.

Until the 80s.

I think it took because we just invented more and more garbage.

Right.

And we just got to eat food and everything.

Yeah.

And everyone started eating out like McDonald's basically.

Yeah.

Necessitated the workout craze of the 80s.

Like if you wanted to be in the, let's say the 40s, if you wanted to be fat, you had to like just get a really dirty.

You had to eat lard out of a bucket with a spoon.

And that's what they did.

And everyone knew.

You know, that's what's a word.

Who was it Laurel or Hardy?

Which one was the fat one?

Hardy.

And now we have hardies.

And now we have Hardy, Scott.

And now we have our base.

Where's it end?

We don't have laurels.

No, of course not.

We don't have stands.

We have abbots.

We don't have Castellos.

No.

I remember going to a restaurant by the name of claim jumper.

They have some around here.

Of course.

When I, in the middle.

The best out of the little prospector.

Little prostitute.

That's what I thought you were going to say.

Little prostate exam.

And I remember we were one of the people in, in that we went to church with and they have giant portions and everyone was like, I like how big the portions are.

And they were ungodly looking at the time.

Now when you go, it's what everyone serves.

So everyone just eats too much.

Is that right?

I think it is.

It's weird that that's become a movement in restaurants.

I remember.

Well it became like we're going to charge you more.

Yeah.

But we're going to give you extra portions.

So shut up.

So, so really it's a con in a certain way of like at the time say a dinner was 10.

They would charge you 15, but we're going to give you a dinner and a half.

And now the food costs are probably pretty low.

So you know, but food is garbage.

Right.

But they're charging you an extra five.

They made so much money that way.

Now, cut to now.

Everyone is just charging the 15 and giving you these big portions because everyone got so used to that they're eating just a ton of garbage now.

Have you ever been a Magiano's?

No, I have not.

It's in the old country.

It's not it's right here in America.

What?

And they're fame they famously have absurd portion sizes to where they're bringing like it's basically like a trash can lid with food on it.

Right.

Like here you go.

Here's too much food.

You're like Heath Cliff, right?

You just want to toss around some fish bones from a trash can.

Here you go.

You piece of shit.

You fat beast.

Shit.

If you go out to eat, you probably if you go with a partner, you could.

I think you could probably survive just eating buying one thing and splitting it.

Like this is partner?

Yeah.

This is awkward.

We're having like a really good business.

But now we're splitting food.

Sure.

Is that's not going to get in the way of our business?

Have you ever dined with us before?

I hate that question.

I because anytime a waiter says, have you ever dined with us before?

I get it.

I know what dining out is usually what they have to quote, explain, unquote.

It's a variation on small plates.

Yeah.

Oh, they want to talk about a small plate.

Here's what I like to say.

The real question is, have you ever dined with me before?

She should do a raw shock on him.

Every time that you and Janie have dinner at home and you.

I'm not dining with you.

You're dining with me.

You should say to her, have you ever dined with us before?

As you said down the meal.

Have I ever dined with you before?

Is this your card?

Oh, I want to do that now.

Have I ever dined with you before?

The waiter could say it.

Have I ever dined with you before?

I get it.

I understand the concept.

At one point, someone was like, because tapas was all the rage for a while here in LA.

Tapas.

And you would see everyone would liken things to tapas.

They would say, it's a lot like tapas where you get a lot of small plates.

At one point, I went to a tapas restaurant.

They're like, have you ever dined with us before?

I was like, about to say, I understand the concept of tapas.

They said, it's a lot like dim sum.

I've never heard dim sum likened to tapas.

Yeah.

Anyway, waiters, stop doing it.

Waiters, stop asking.

If I understand tapas, start asking if I understand bottom us.

Famous power bottom us.

These are the truth.

All right, let's get to it.

Let's get to our countdown.

This is number six on the countdown.

Number six.

All right, number six, and this number is a special number as it is one of our mid-century marks.

This is episode 550.

Still in the 500s.

Is this an Eames?

I don't know what that means.

It's mid-century.

Oh, I understand.

This is, you know, we, for a while we were trying to do some special things on episode 200 was Jason Manzukas.

In honor of a special thing, the website.

Right.

Remember that?

So episode 200 was Jason Manzukas and Andy Daley, I believe episode 300 we did Jason Manzukas and Andy Daley, maybe 400 for 500.

So let's not do that.

Let's not do that.

It's entirely different.

I don't, I don't think those guys were available or something, but when 550 rolled around, I was like, guys, let's get the gang back together.

This is an episode called Cheezing Out the Wave D-hole.

And that it actually stands for Cheezing Out the Wave Dickhole, which.

Oh, it actually does?

Which we mentioned perhaps in this clip.

But when I read the title, I was like, what does this mean?

Cheezing out the Wave D-hole.

Apparently it's, we talk about it for a while, which is going through a circular wave as if we were ejaculate.

Sure.

So this is Jason Manzukas and myself as ourselves.

And we have the inimitable Andy Daley, who returned to the show playing Hot Dog.

Hot Dog is.

Famous Water Skier?

Of course.

He's a famous water skier.

Shana Nai Enthusiast wants to join the band.

He was the first person to water ski on sausages.

That's right.

And so we talked to him for a while.

I'm going to play several parts of this episode, like three different parts of it.

And this was a really fun one.

And this is what you have voted as your number six.

Let's hear it.

Number six.

Well, this is huge because it eclipses everything else.

I have been inducted into the water skiing hall of fame.

Whoa.

I made congratulations Hot Dog.

And so many good things have come from it.

I mean, I lobbied hard for that for you.

Let's talk about your water skiing.

Just to remind people who haven't heard you before.

Well, the reason I go by Hot Dog is that I am a Hot Dog of Water Skiing.

You know that I'm a Hot Water Skiing Hot Dog.

It does not have to do with the fact that you were water skiing upon Hot Dog.

No, although I did do some of that.

And what not actually?

No, but you actually were water skiing on...

I was water skiing on salamis.

And I was the first guy ever.

And that's one of the things that we talk about it.

But that's a real Hot Dog kind of thing to do.

Yeah.

But you're a Hot Dog.

I just want everyone to make sure they know it's not because you were skiing upon Hot Dogs.

That's correct.

And really your attitude towards skiing, you were Hot Dogging merely upon salamis.

That's exactly right.

And I was Hot Dogging long before I came up with the idea of water skiing on salamis.

I've been Hot Dogging for a long time on water skiing.

When you finally got to salamis.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What other food stuffs had you been water skiing on?

Cheers.

Well, naturally, I started with baguettes.

I was going to say baguettes.

Of course I did.

I would think red floats.

No, like if you were throwing it at the ducks.

I bet it would be sogging for you.

You come up between the two of you, you came up with the pro anicon.

Because that's true.

It does float, but on the other hand, right, you're right, it gets soggy.

Yeah.

And you don't know that until you try it, until you strap yourself onto the baguette.

Right.

Get yourself into the water.

I would love it if you would.

Did you ever try like six foot long party subs?

Sure.

I tried to six foot long party subs.

As a matter of fact, I did that in association with the sandwich shop down there in Rado.

Oh, nice.

Santa Rado Beach says the sandwich shop.

And I proposed it.

I pitched it to them.

And they provided the sandwiches.

For free?

For publicity.

Not for free.

I had to buy them.

But for publicity.

And you paid for the sandwich.

Yeah, I had a well, of course.

I mean, you know, it's a sweet deal.

You know, I worked it out with the sandwich shop.

Well, at least you haven't given their name now.

So they're not getting further from Brian and Ronaldo.

Oh, Jesus man.

Brian and Ronaldo's down in the redondo beach.

And was it two six foot party subs or was it one that you had to break in half?

It was two six foots.

Brian made one and Ronaldo made the other.

And is that how they work?

That's always how they alternate sandwiches.

They do.

They go one for one.

Is one better than the other?

Well, when you go into Brian and Ronaldo.

You're going to be in trouble.

Brian and Ronaldo's in Redondo Beach.

Are you like hoping for a Ronaldo?

Well, you're going to give me a trouble.

I can't say.

But let's just say, Ronaldo, it seems busy working on a sandwich.

You're in good shape.

You know what I'm saying?

Yeah, that's what it's time to step on.

Order, order them.

Yeah, that's when you need to.

Anyway, yeah.

So that was, yeah, but look, that didn't work because the all the ingredients, it was immediately obvious as soon as the boat started up.

Let us.

And I started waving to my captain like, no, no, no, they're going to work.

They're going to work with the sandwiches.

Because of lettuce and the tomatoes and all the meats and everything just started flying right out of the sandwich.

Right.

And where was your captain on land or in the boat?

The captain was in the boat.

In the boat.

But he's, you know, that's a good place for a captain when you're watching.

He ought to be there.

They're not always, but he ought to be there.

Right.

Yeah.

Driving the boat.

And what did he do when you waved Hey, we're not ready?

Did he alter his behavior at all?

This is one of the real problems that I'll tell you.

This is one of the real problems with water skiing.

If anybody could crack this, they will win a Nobel prize from water skiing because the problem is that the captain by definition has his back turned to his water.

I'm sorry.

Does the Nobel committee give out a prize in water skiing?

Is it a peace prize?

No, no, it's Nobel prize.

Just Nobel prize.

Yeah, they have not given one out in years.

Oh, they haven't.

No, they haven't.

I know they give one out in science.

They give one out in multiple different disciplines.

It's not some of the awards are annual awards and some of them are just sort of as as need to.

How many years?

All of them?

How long has it been since the Nobel Committee?

How many prize in water?

Yeah.

I've lost track personally.

Really?

It's been a piece of decade.

Can you name one water skiing Nobel laureate?

Well, I don't know for sure, but they must have given one to Terry Crackettola.

Yeah.

There was a second to that.

I can do that.

Posthumously.

Posthumously because he died.

Yeah, you know, he passed away.

So your captain is facing the water as to not steer the ship into.

And at this point, he's the captain now.

Who's the captain now?

Oh, yeah.

Well, hey, I know you're referring to the captain.

I know you're referring to that movie about pirates, right?

Yeah, right.

And this is a problem facing water skiers.

There have been incidents where pirates have taken over the speedboat that is pulling a water skier.

Oh.

And then the water skier is powerless.

The water skier is literally powerless.

That's got to be exciting, though.

Well, you know, like that's a bit of danger to add to like a day's water ski.

Yeah.

I mean, and this is one of the reasons you have to be careful of your water skiing down at the Cape of Horn, the Horn Cape of Horn, the Horn Cape of Africa.

Sure, sure.

The Africa Horn.

Yep.

You know what I'm talking about.

You said it exactly right.

Did I have the Cape Horn Cape of Africa?

It's really like Africa's like drooping balls.

Yeah.

You know how Florida is America's, you know, drooping dick and Maine is the erection of the United States of America.

So wait, that's what they call it.

So that's what it says on the license plate.

So Florida is America flaccid and then when it gets hard, it goes all the way into the eastern seaboard and becomes Maine.

Well, if you've been to Maine straight into Canada.

Yeah, man.

Everybody in Maine is horny and there's a reason.

Yeah.

And everybody in Florida is riddled with STDs.

That's true.

We've talked about it on this show, that movie Captain Phillips.

It's like half Captain Phillips.

Then the other guy comes in and goes, I'm the captain now.

Oh, he should change the title.

What's that guy's name?

I don't know.

Captain whatever his name is.

He should be Captain Phillips and Captain whatever that guy's name is.

Sure.

Captain Phillips and then regular guy Phillips.

Oh, okay.

Since we're not really changing POV into the Captain.

Anyway, some sort of Captain Phillips.

Captain Phillips.

Comet isn't the Captain for the whole movie.

For the whole movies, you don't get your hopes up.

Captain Phillips and former Captain Phillips.

As an audience member, help me manage my expectations.

Exactly.

For what I'm about to, like force awakens, right?

Okay.

I never saw the force sleeping, never mind waking.

In the first place.

When was the force asleep?

You know, it's a very descriptive term, but I never saw it actually happen.

Yeah.

Like I like Avengers Infinity War because it's like the Avengers are in it.

Yeah.

And they're going to fight the Infinity War.

Although I would have appreciated if it said Avengers fight the Infinity War.

Well, I figured it out.

Oh, see, I think that, oh, I think you misunderstood it.

I think the Avengers Infinity War is the Avengers are fighting a war that will allow us to fight the last four in infinity.

So you expected to go and watch this movie till the end of your life?

Well, I think this is moving.

And it would still be going on.

I feel like every movie that comes up, subsequently, is just going to be another installment of this war.

So you had made your peace with your family, your friends going into this movie.

You expected to die until the end.

I was like, I need to see where this is going.

I got my affairs in order.

I wondered where you had been for the past month or so.

I would have executed a will.

I wouldn't mind seeing a prequel, by the way, where the force is asleep.

I wouldn't mind to see that.

Let's just watch that one.

Oh, yeah.

But like where someone is putting the force to bed, like reading it.

Yeah, the pain force.

Go the fuck to sleep.

Reading a story.

And then everybody's got to be quiet.

Yeah.

The force is sleeping.

Force is sleeping.

Please, you're going to wake the force.

Don't wake up the force.

Please don't wake up the force.

I spent a half hour trying to put the force down.

The force is so cranky.

Yeah, man.

So hot dog, what happened to the captain?

Oh, yeah.

He was staring ahead and you were on the sandwich.

Oh, no, I'm just saying it's a general problem with water skiing that the captain can't see.

Sometimes you're trying to flag down the captain and say, wait, wait, there's a problem.

I got a problem back here.

And he can't see you.

Right.

And it's just maybe he'll turn around and look at a good water skiing captain.

We'll turn around and look at him once in a while.

But he has to also keep his eyes out ahead of him.

Why can't this be a two person job?

Well, sometimes it is.

Sometimes you have a spotter.

That's true.

But now, spotter for the driving or spotter for the water skier.

Well, if you, you know, it's the serious operation, if you're in championship competition or something like that, of course you're going to have a spotter.

But if you're just out there, pleasure cruising or something like that, you know, you maybe can't afford the 20 bucks to give the spotter.

I think the spotter should be for the driving.

So the captain is driving the boat, but turning his head around to look at the water skier and the spotter is looking out ahead and says, hey, hey, hey, you're about to hit something.

Because it's much more likely.

It's much more likely that the spotter won't have very much to see in the open ocean in front of you.

Exactly.

But you as the captain are directly affecting the person behind you.

Give the spotter way more to do.

Well, hey, you're going to hit this thing.

Because otherwise you're paying a guy to basically like hang on and on the 10% chance he's going to see something wrong with the water ski.

Here's what I'm shocked by.

Okay.

I'm shocked that we don't yet have water skis that don't need a boat to fool them.

What are you talking about?

Like, yeah, jet water skis.

Like water skis.

Yes.

Like jet skis.

I guess is what you're pitching.

Basically, why haven't we been able to boil a jet ski down into just two sticks?

Two sticks that you put on your feet.

You might just have won yourself a Nobel Prize in water skiing.

I mean, like that idea of the big first one.

That is great.

That changes the game.

At this point in history, we should have that.

We have electric skateboards.

Yes, of course.

Let's drive themselves.

We have electric bikes.

We have self-driving cars.

Self-driving cars.

You're telling me we can't put a fucking motor in the couple of six foot subs?

Yeah.

Well, I mean, I could tell you that on a rudimentary level, things like this have been tried.

Oh, yeah.

People have tried to sort of, you know, Jerry rigged some motors.

Is there something like that?

You know, every time you go to the aerospace museum, there's that fun.

Every time you go, what does that mean?

What do you mean?

There's that five minute clip montage of all the people trying their airplanes.

How often are you going to the aerospace museum?

You can't.

You know?

It's fun.

You had that every weekend out there to DC?

You know, they have that clip montage of the guy flapping mechanical wings.

All the times people tried to fly and they were like, did you have a bad idea?

Is there something like that with water skis?

Well, there's only one video clip and you've got to know a guy if you want to see it.

And it's because it's like...

Is that guy Bill YouTube?

It's pretty much.

Well, no, Bill wouldn't touch it.

His brother has it though.

What happened on the...

Randy YouTube?

Randy YouTube has got this one and it's on the Randy web.

YouTube Fred?

By the way, the Randy web, I've looked it up.

It is not what you think.

Really?

It is pretty Randy stuff.

Well, this is one clip that you can see and I've seen it and I wish I could unsee it.

But it is.

What happened?

It's a clip of a guy who did try to put a couple of motors onto a water skis for this very reason.

Backfired.

The first was that he had got into a real fight with his captain and he was just like...

What about?

Is that included on the tape?

Oh, well, the captain slept with all three of this guy's wife.

Whoa!

This guy was a polygamous?

No, no, no.

It was one at a time.

Oh, I see.

It's like over time.

He's on his third marriage and he finds out this guy slept with this one too.

Wow.

So they had a throw down and he said, and you know, by that point, this guy was an asshole.

I'm going to tell you.

So a lot of people didn't want to put...

Didn't want to be his captain.

He said, I don't need a captain at all.

So he tried to put mode and he went directly into the water.

These things propelled him deep into the water.

Were they sinking or they were just literally like...

I think he must have just direction them wrong or something like that.

Oh, I see instead of like...

So they carried him directly to the ocean floor.

It was perpendicular.

Of course, he imagined he was going to be going over the water, right?

Right, of course.

You could picture me.

When he had it, mind.

When one imagines water skis, that's the first thought.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I guess, I don't know, he just angled him wrong and they sent him straight into the water.

Straight down to the ocean's floor.

Right down to the David Jones locker.

David Jones locker.

And this was...

He was doing this right over the Mariana's trench.

Do you know what the Mariana's trench is?

Sure, of course.

So this was...

As far as we know, he is still headed down there.

He's still traveling down there.

Oh, wow.

It's so deep.

As you know, I work at Car Rental Counter over there at the Burbank Airport.

That is right.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What did we...

We've talked about it before.

What exactly happens there?

What happens?

Yeah, it seemed like there was some sort of detail about the way you interacted with customers or...

Oh, I don't know.

Except I'm always...

I can never sell anybody the supplemental insurance.

Oh, right.

That's my main problem.

But I was working at the budget and funny thing happened.

I went to work one day and it was...

I was halfway through my work day before I realized that I was at Hertz and it was...

And no one had cared.

Nobody cared.

And so now I'm at Hertz.

But anyway, since I'm at Hertz now, I'm in there.

They're a system.

I mean, they're database.

And you're not going to fucking believe this.

You're jacked in, huh?

Screaming Scott.

From Shana and I.

Read to the car through her.

He never went to budget.

He started...

But he is a long time Hertz guy.

He's got the...

He's got the rewards card and everything.

He has a Hertz credit card.

He's always getting points.

Right.

Anyway, so because of that...

Hurts points.

He's getting Hertz points all the time.

Now because of that, I have his email address.

Wow.

I got a screen with Scott's email address and I'm like, I'm not going to use it until I have just the right reason to use it.

Okay, yeah.

I'm going to ask him.

Smart.

Very smart because I can imagine the minute you got it, you could have been like, hey Screaming Scott, it's me.

Exactly.

And I wanted to.

You know I wanted to.

Oh.

And I have literally like 10,000 emails to scream at Scott in my draft folder.

But anyway, finally, when I got...

Literally 10,000.

Literally, yeah.

I said I have been alerted to, but that I...

It's too much and I need to clean it up.

By whom?

By Google?

I got a call from Tom Apple myself.

Tom Apple called me.

I believe you.

And I had to give him my password and everything.

Anyway, smart family pet name.

Did he ask you to put yourself on tape?

Yeah, Tom Apple.

He didn't send him a urine sample.

I had to send him everything.

My DNA and everything.

But anyway, so that probably was resolved.

But...

You could have just spit into a cop.

I don't know why.

What's that for the DNA?

Anyway, go on.

I had to give him a quarter blood.

When I got into the water skiing hall of fame, I saw an opportunity and I realized if I could get myself into that hall of fame, I can get Shanna Nah into the rock and roll hall of fame.

Oh, okay.

Which I know is something they want.

They have not even nominated or...

To the best of my knowledge.

By the way, I think the whole hall of fame system is such an asshole move to like, oh, we're going to nominate 10 bands this year, but only six are going to get in.

I'll tell you one thing about the rock and roll hall of fame.

No other award show has anywhere near that amount of complaining about people who didn't get in.

I know.

It is constant.

But for an organization that is ostensibly pointless.

Yes, and will allow almost anyone to get in.

Regardless of their connection to quote unquote rock and roll.

Rock and roll, exactly.

And yet, Shanna Nah is not in it.

I mean, does that make any sense?

I mean, this is the number one interpreters of classic rock and roll in the United States.

I guess that you could say that they should belong in a rock and roll interpreters hall of fame because they're not actually pioneers of rock and roll.

Shanna Nah has a song called the rock and roll hall of fame.

We should probably listen to it, don't you think?

Sure.

By the way, I want to do a new podcast called.

Did you bring it?

Shanna Nah-ing to me, R.E.

Me.

Please don't.

That's my idea for a new podcast and I might do a pilot.

But anyways, so I used Screamin' Scott's email address and I emailed Screamin' Scott and I pitched him.

I said, you know what, let me be the guy that gets you guys into the rock and roll hall of fame.

And that is now my job.

And he said, you can do that.

Go for it.

Whoa.

And he said, go for it.

Wait, was there anything else in this email?

Yeah.

He replied to you.

To me.

Did you tell him you were hot dog?

No.

What did you just use HD?

I signed off under a totally different name.

Which name was this?

I signed off under the name Kill Bossa.

Well.

Now, yeah.

Smart.

Right.

Smart.

So, and he said, yeah, do it.

And I said, if I do it, can I be in the group?

And he has just replied.

Yeah, it's not a pleasure.

He has replied that email.

This sounds like it was just recently.

How long ago was this?

That was like 18 months ago.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So, I'm sure it's imminent.

You know, this guy, I mean, these guys are so fucking, if you look at their tour schedule.

Just for flying to the other members of Shana and Amma's take up half the day.

No kidding about that.

How many people are in Shana and Amma?

Five or six.

But anyways, and is it all original members at this point?

No, no, no.

No, they got, they got some new guys in there.

They lost some guys.

Is Bowser still in there?

Bowser hasn't been in the group for a long time.

And Bowser Bauman.

John Bowser Bauman is the first.

Most of the Hollywood squares.

Back in the, when it was the Hollywood squares, match game hour.

Oh, he hosted it?

He hosted one of those.

Yeah.

He either hosted the match game or he hosted the Hollywood square.

I think he was.

As Bowser.

I think, no, as John Bowser Bauman, he was the center square in Hollywood squares.

And then he was the host of match game.

Yeah, well, he now, he's very politically involved.

And as somebody pointed out, he has never once backed a candidate that won.

Not even one time.

Not even one, apparently not.

Wow.

Big into Dukakis.

Yeah.

John Cairn.

He was all in for Mondale.

But, oh, and when I say that, I mean my fist in my mouth.

Oh, yeah.

He put his whole business.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

So now that's my job.

I am crusading to get the Shonnana into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

How are you going to do this?

Okay.

It involves your listeners writing in letters.

These listeners are the listeners of Shonnana.

Listen to Shonnana, presumably already on the case.

And it involves your all of your listeners.

You need to write a letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

I wonder.

I wonder if we...

Because so many people listen to this show that I think if we all for fun tried to get Shonnana into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Yeah, I wonder what that would take.

We got to do it.

We need a little more...

We need to make it one step easier for people.

I feel like...

Okay.

Well, there's got to be an online voting.

That's what I'm saying.

I know they're like we need to be giving people a thing that they can just do.

There is online voting.

And I know that that's part of it every year now.

So I guess Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has an online voting?

Yeah.

We could also petition the White House.

Well...

But I know that they can do it.

I think it would be fun in the name of Hot Dog.

I wonder...

Yeah.

To get Shonnana into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

They'll put Bon Jovi in there.

I mean, this is what I'm saying.

You know what I mean?

When it came out, it was like, oh, this is like, you know, this is like cut-rate Boston.

Bon Jovi had a whole long speech about how ridiculously long it took to get him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame now.

He is bitter.

John Bon Jovi has been like vocally bitter that they have not gotten in yet because...

And it's all because he thinks, he says rather, that Jan Wenner doesn't like him.

But the whole thing is personal beef between Jan Wenner, Rolling Stone founder and Bon Jovi.

Well, that's good information because Jananandis will butter up Jan Wenner.

Oh, yeah.

So the other way you can come at this is just everybody tweet Jan Wenner.

What about Shonnana, Jan?

You think they're...

What about Jan-ana?

Jan-ana.

Hey, there's like a...

Jan-ana.

If Jan Wenner wanted to join Shonnana...

Would you be upset?

I'd call it Jan-ana.

Well...

Would you be upset if...

I'd let Jan Wenner in just to get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and change their name to Jan-ana.

I mean, I wouldn't love that.

I wouldn't love it, but I would like it because if they get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, no matter how, I think I'm in the band.

Yeah.

Wait, do you want Shonnana to be happy or do you want to be in the band?

Which of those two...

I have a second to make.

The other thing we could try and do is see if we can get Nasha Shah in the Rock and Roll.

That's gonna be impossible.

That's gonna be hard.

Nasha Shah, we have not recorded an album yet.

The tribute band...

I guess they...

We would have to wait 25 years.

The tribute band...

Getting into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Oh, I see the tribute band Hall of Fame.

The tribute...

How do you...

Should be the electric punks...

You might have just won the Nobel Prize in Hall of Fame's.

Can I ask, is every other band or artist that played at Woodstock alongside Shonnana?

Are they in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

Oh, that's a great argument.

I doubt it.

I'm sure there are bands that play...

That are not in the Rock Hall of Fame.

Ten years after, are they in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

The Turtles.

Is Richie Havens in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?

I bet.

I can see Richie Havens being in.

I don't know about the Turtles though.

They're gonna put him in.

The Turtles?

The Turtles play, was that?

Yeah.

Jefferson Airplane.

John Eddie.

John Eddie's not in the Rock Hall of Fame.

Shonnana is not even part of the conversation anymore.

Like if you look at the list of people, you know, they're all the way up to Depeche Mode now and people like that.

I feel like Shonnana...

What is the...

It's the 50th...

Well, there's no...

25 years from your first record.

But there's no... there's no limit of like, if it's 50 years you're out.

Like if you haven't done it in 50 years you're on it.

Oh yeah, well Nina Simone just got in.

Right, but next year they put Nina Simone in and they haven't put in Shonnana.

Yeah.

That's an outrage.

Yes, exactly.

But next year is the year because of 2019.

I think it should be the mission...

It's the 50th anniversary.

50th anniversary.

It's the mission of everyone who listens to this show.

Yeah.

Here's what I'll say.

All right, all right.

Because we just had the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame a month ago, right?

Yeah.

Next year is the 50th anniversary of Shonnana.

They're saying everything that I've just said.

They inducted like six...

They inducted six people a month ago.

Next year they should only induct Shonnana.

And just make it a Shonnana blowout.

Oh, that would be it.

Would that be amazing?

And the end jam session is just...

Just Shonnana.

Just Shonnana doing their...

No instruments on stage.

No.

Just a cappella Shonnana.

That would be amazing.

Doop.

I mean, let's make that happen audience of Comedy Bang Bang.

There is no group that deserves to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame more than Shonnana because Shonnana is a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

They popularized the music to a degree that they're even...

Would it have cause for Hall of Fame?

Yes.

Well, I guess ten years after no one was singing Doop anymore, they did come around...

The band ten years after?

I'm looking on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website for a place to vote in.

I can't find it.

I think maybe what happens is there's a certain point when it's unveiled.

But what I would say is...

Oh, yeah.

Sharpiered listeners out there, they will know how to do this.

So I will tweet out a link or something of instructions of how to do this.

We don't know how to do it now.

We're going to do it for 2019, the 50th anniversary of the band.

This would be amazing.

It'll be our 10th anniversary as well for Comedy Bang Bang.

I mean, what better present to me than to...

Here's what I'm willing to say.

I'm willing to say...

You're only willing to say it.

I'm willing to say this.

And I'm going to say this is a pretty...

I will say everything that you say you are willing to say.

If we get...

I am willing to say what I'm about to say.

If we get Shina in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they will be on this show.

They will be on this show.

And you...

You won't be...

Hot dog will get to meet...

No.

What I'm saying is...

Oh, I thought it'd meet them, sure.

But we will force them to give you another audition.

Yes.

Not saying that...

Yes.

That's all I want.

I'm not saying that...

Here's the thing.

Rock and Roll Hall of Fame that you are in the group.

I'm saying that they will...

Yes.

The question is if our listeners get them into the Hall of Fame, then you...

They have to give you a shot.

A fair shot too, because I've been asking you to show...

Well, although, I mean, guys, I mean, what scream at Scott has agreed to by not responding to my email is that I will be in the pan.

He has not agreed to.

I think you should walk that back a little bit.

Yeah.

What I'm saying is...

You're going to be disappointed.

Every time that you've auditioned previously, they've remembered you from the previous times.

Oh, I think it took 10 or 12 times for them to start to remember me.

But since then they haven't.

But what I'm saying is they're aware of me.

Clean slate.

We got to clean slate it.

They have to forget everything they've ever known about what a nuisance you are.

And they have to give you a fair shot.

We never talked about this.

When you die, you want to be turned into hot dogs and force-fed to humans.

Well, I didn't know.

I mean, look.

Yes.

We've talked about this on previous shows.

I know.

Not during the break.

Force-fed or just fed or offered.

Or used as nourishment.

Well, things have changed.

I am going to be turning into hot dogs when I die.

Approximately 29.

I remember your saying.

I think roughly 27, 29 hot dogs is what you do.

Does that fluctuate with your weight?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And I have to go update my will.

That's the only way it fluctuates.

Yeah, yeah.

And every time I lose, if I lose like about five pounds, I'll go to my lawyer and I'll update my will because you know.

Can I ask you a question?

Yeah.

Are you going to do just a plain casing and then just your body?

Just to me.

Are you going to like put some stuff, are you going to bring it to Brian and Ronaldo and have them maybe bring it to Brian and have him put some like apple or some cheese or some smoked something in there like really spice it up into a nice sandwich kind of hot dog.

I really just want myself to be the only ingredient.

Was my sort of plan.

By the way, August Lynn was going to do this for you, right?

Oh, yeah.

That's right.

August Lynn was going to take care of for me out there in Germany because he's a sort of food science man.

He's thinking primarily he's a guy who likes to chop people up.

Yeah, food science.

Like he said, food science.

Like molecular gastronomy.

Right.

Yeah, you know, turning a dog into a hot dog meat.

Yeah.

Well, he's a molecular level.

He's a salt inspector, you know.

Right.

Yeah.

That impresses me.

Yeah.

But anyway, yeah, I'm going to be going to get turned into a number of hot dogs and then at first I was going to be fed to my ex wife.

That was my plan.

Forcefed.

Well, or fed.

You know, she offered and then tricked.

Or tricked.

Okay, offered first, then tricked.

Yeah, that's right.

I think I don't think the offer is a trick.

Right.

You're skipping right to the trip.

That's what I'm saying.

But if for some reason you would first say, do you want a hot dog made out of your ex-husband's body meat?

I think that's the only polite.

And if she says no, thank you, then you then you trick.

Then you do an elaborate ruse.

You get it.

By the way, Jason just mined a circle as if he's walking out with the hot dog on a tray into another room and then coming right back into the room saying I have a different hot dog.

From the first offer.

Offers.

She's going to be really, her, her granddaughter.

I have her for hot dogs of any kind.

Well, but then I then you may recall there was a period of time where I was, my plan was to have those hot dogs served to the members of Sean Anak because I was real mad at those guys at that time.

I have since I've taken that right out of my will that is no longer in my will.

But I just updated it because you might have heard, you know, Mitt Romney, you've never met Romney from the presidential race.

I think I think Bowser might have backed him.

Bowser might have backed Mitt Romney.

But Mitt Romney recently was asked, who's your favorite water skier?

And he said hot dog.

And I was thrilled with that.

And then I don't know that that was the question that was asked of him.

Well, it was the question.

I believe someone was asking him what his favorite meat was.

Oh.

And he said, he said hot dog was his favorite.

He said, my favorite meat is hot dog.

Oh, I thought that he had said the hot dog was his favorite water skier.

No, it doesn't matter.

It works either way because when I heard that, I thought, well, I should be served to him.

You know what I mean?

If somebody, because I don't hear that very often, somebody says they're such a compliment.

It's a big compliment.

Also, it was very weird that Mitt Romney said hot dogs singularly.

He said, my favorite meat is hot dog.

Well, now I'm kind of, I heard it.

That's a quote.

This is a quote, Jason.

My favorite meat is hot dog.

And then he also said, my second favorite meat is hamburger.

But I like hot dog the best.

Oh, no.

Oh, what?

Yeah.

So I can see why you were confused because a human being does not talk like that about the food.

And yet I would so much rather prefer him to be my president.

Ben Hillary, I get it.

But so I can see why you're confused.

Does this show exist in a universe where Hillary is president?

I can see why you're confused because when one mentions hot dog singular, it's usually about you.

That's right.

Yeah.

So I was a little confused.

You're now going to be served to Mitt Romney.

You have hit in your will, who will serve you to Mitt Romney?

Is like there, it does your, for example, does the captain of your boat take your hot dogs and serve them?

Like is there a person in charge of this?

I can't the spotter more to do.

Yeah.

John Bowser, Baumann.

Well, what I have said over at Brian and Bernardo's down there in Redondo, they've got a girl who, you know, she'll bring the food to your table, but I've always said, waitress.

Yeah, they've got a girl who does that.

You got a girl who will bring the food to the table.

Yeah.

But I don't know if she's really, because you pay for it at the register, I don't know if she's waitress.

Anyway, okay.

So she, okay.

But my whole thing was guys, you got to do a thing.

You got to, I got to be able to order from my car and she should come out on roller skates because I'm a big fan of roller skating waitresses.

Right.

And so anyway, that's how I imagine Mitt Romney being served my hot dogs by a girl or, because it's gonna be a lot of hot dogs, maybe a couple of girls.

This particular girl from Brian and Bernardo's.

Yeah.

But she, well, I mean, I like this girl.

You seem fascinated with her.

Yeah.

Her name is Jeanine.

Oh, and yeah, she's really sweet.

She's good.

Yeah, she's a good kid.

Anyway, I'd like to see her in a tiny, tiny, tiny little skirt on a pair of roller skates serving me.

Serving you.

You like to see her.

I'd like to see that.

Serving you.

So wait, how are you going to see that though?

Like from, from the great beyond?

Oh, we know we're not sentient when we're dead and you know what I mean?

Also, are your eyes part of the hot dogs?

Do they get ground down into the body meat?

Yeah, the eyeballs is involved.

Yeah.

You don't know that you don't know that eyeballs are part of hot dogs.

I didn't know that.

There's a lot of eyes.

Because part of me wonders like, would you want your eyes to be left out?

There is no eye in hot dogs.

Yeah.

Would you want your eyes to be left outside so they can watch what's happening?

You know?

Oh, I see what you're talking about.

So like, yeah, just pluck the eyeballs out and just arrange them on a tray.

Yeah.

You guys have a different girl on roller skates like, you know, skating around with your eyeballs and looking at it.

I like that idea a lot, but you're inspiring me to think of another, a different idea which feels like it.

I know it would work, which is if right now I donated a part of myself to become a hot dog.

Ooh.

Okay.

And like this, I got to watch Janine serve that to Mitt Romney and then lean over to him and say, hey, you know what you're eating?

And which part of it?

I have one question and one question only.

Okay.

And I believe it's a good question as well.

Are you going to make it to one hot dog?

One hot dog.

But I would have to fit me in a bun.

Yeah.

You know?

Sure.

Yeah.

But other than that, I have no luck.

Hot dog.

You're going to slice off your penis and mail it to Janine.

You know.

In a bun?

In the hopes that she gives it to Mitt Romney?

Yeah.

I mean, this is a new plan, but I like it to just cut off.

First of all, you have to get Mitt Romney into Brian and Ronaldo's.

Or in his car out front.

Sure.

Oh.

Even though they don't have roller skating wages in there.

Not yet.

Oh, I got to do is get Janine a pair of roller skates and a real tiny, tiny little skirt.

And you're going to send all of this in a box, a pair of roller skates, a tiny skirt and your penis?

In a hot dog.

And then I'll be, then I'll be.

Are you going to cook it?

Or is this a job for August lint?

August lint.

We'll probably smoke it.

You know.

Obviously you want to be turned into hot dogs and consumed.

Why not do it in a way that is at one of these celebrations where you are mixed in amongst the hot dogs in a hot dog eating contest?

Oh, well, that's not a bad idea too.

I mean, it's a lot of different ways to accomplish this.

Because once I have served my penis to Mitt Romney, I think at that point that itch will have been scratched in terms of like having somebody eat.

By the way, you're never going to be able to scratch that itch down there.

Once that's gone.

Here we go.

I think you're going to have a phantom memory of that for a while.

I think if you can get that done, yeah, we can get Shanna now in the Proctorov.

No, look, if you can get that done, anything's possible.

We have a lot of big goals.

Big goals are coming out of this.

Big goals for 2019, bro.

Yeah.

Number six.

Oh, there we go.

Yes.

Number six, cheesing out the Wave D-hole.

Cheezing out the Wave D-hole.

So towards the end there, we made a solemn vow that we were going to get Shanna now into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year.

A listener even started a petition.

It might have been a government petition to the White House, I'm not sure, for Shanna Naugh to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

I signed it, I think.

I will say the other day, the inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Class of 2019 were announced and Radiohead was there and the Cure was there and guess who was not there with Shanna Naugh?

Bob Dylan.

He was inducted so long ago.

So he wasn't there?

He wasn't there, but he's already in.

Yeah, so I mentioned a question you asked.

Granted, he was not inducted as a member of the Traveling Wilburys.

Okay, but I'm answering the question that you asked.

When do they get so desperate for Rock and Roll royalty that they're like, Traveling Wilburys, you're in.

You're in.

You're in got in there.

You're in.

The concept of urine.

If you were in like to Pesh mode and you've wanted to get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for so long and then they announce you, they're like, we only have two inductees this year to Pesh mode and the concept of urine.

By the way, we're shutting down after this ceremony.

So the concept of urine gets in first and then to Pesh mode.

Pesh mode and then very last people.

Close for business.

Well, I was sorry to hear about Sean and not getting in.

That was a fun episode inspired, I believe simply by Mitt Romney saying that his favorite meat was hot dog.

Or like approximately two weeks earlier.

That's right.

I was like, Andy, let's get into this.

Your country needs you.

All right, let's take a break.

When we come back, we are going to be listening to number five.

We are getting so high in this countdown.

I can't even believe it.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

Comedy bang here with Paul F. Tompkins.

Hello.

And here we are counting down your top 14 episodes of the year and we're so high in this countdown right now.

You are hearing the crown jewels as far as I'm concerned of comedy bang bang.

You are in these episodes.

You're the crown jewels.

You're hearing the family jewels of comedy bang bang.

You're hearing run the jewels right now.

You're not listening to us.

You're in jewel.

Famously found in a van.

She was found in a van.

Found dead in a van.

Then she came back to life.

She died as she lived in a van.

Now by the river.

Do you think she was ripping off Chris Farley?

Jewel was ripping off Chris Farley.

Now it can be told.

I've always said she is the new Chris Farley.

Jewel, you know, I never made that connection before.

You've been saying that for a long time.

Oh, Chris Farley, by the way, the anniversary of his passing 20.

Was it 20?

Yeah, I believe the 20th year just happened.

Congratulations.

Nope.

Ah boy.

I don't know why I brought that up.

Much like in the corner of Brian episode.

He didn't know why I kept bringing up people who had passed away.

Well, I don't know.

It's a verbal tick with me.

He could have let it go though.

Yeah, that's true.

You know what I mean?

That's true.

It's true.

Look, the older you get, the more you talk about death.

What is it about?

And I know it's just a cliche, but your parents are no longer with us.

No, you touch wood.

You think they might come back to life?

I don't know.

If people came back to life, and I'm not talking about zombies where they're mindless.

No.

Just people start crawling out of the grave.

Would you be here?

But they do crawl out of the grave.

They crawl themselves out of the grave, but they're sentient and they're like, Hey, I'm back.

Would it be nice to see people?

No, it wouldn't.

It wouldn't, right?

Especially if you've moved on.

We've achieved finality.

I mean, yeah, maybe if the wound is still fresh, it'd be like, whoa, if you're, if you're in, I thought I lost you.

If you're up to dabbed before you get to dabbed.

Yeah, yeah.

Then you're at it.

And we talked about denial.

Anger.

Bargaining.

Death, death yourself?

No.

What's the second D?

Digression.

Destiny's job.

Never going to get it.

Oh, that's a good.

Bargaining.

Dab.

Denial depression.

Depression.

Really depression?

I think so.

Is it depression?

Let me look up Dabda.

We will see engineer Sam is, uh, who can get to Dabda first?

Dabda.

The race is on.

I looked up Danda instead.

Oh, what's that stand for?

Well, Danda in the script, the Danda is a punctuation character, which is a sort of glyph.

It's a real punctuation character.

All right.

Dabda.

Here we go.

We got denial.

Anger.

Bargaining depression.

You're right.

So just depression.

Yeah, that's a terrible part of it.

It makes sense though that that would come right before acceptance.

I guess because if you're being sad about it.

No, no, no, no, no, not happening then fuck.

Why did this happen?

And then look, if this doesn't happen, I'll make you a deal.

Look God.

That's all my vegetables.

If you'll bring your mom back and then fuck.

What was I trying to bargain with God for?

And then at the end, you're like, Oh, okay.

That's so the, the, the, the, hey, your husband died.

The transition from depression into acceptance.

It seems like depression is the low.

I guess this is like classic movie structure though, you know, like right before the third act where everything is resolved is when everything is the lowest.

It is clamos true.

But how, uh, I hope classic movie structure.

Hopefully of course.

Yes.

I knew what you're talking about.

Hopefully if you're out there experiencing DABDA right now, you're getting to that, uh, Hey, are you in the middle of DABDA right now?

If you are, hope you're going to hang in there and get all the way to, uh, why are we talking about any of this?

She's talking about, uh, oh yeah, parents.

What?

They just don't understand.

That's what I'm going to say.

Yes.

No, but why is it that all the anytime you catch up with them, all they can talk about is who's sick, who died?

It's fun.

Look, they're retired.

It's like a gossip columnist.

Yeah.

Oh, you'll never.

Who's dead?

That's how I want to deliver that news from now on.

You will never guess who's done.

Yeah.

Oh my God.

Did you hear a dad?

Oh, no.

Who died?

He didn't die in prison.

Nope.

He was released.

Um, the specials saying about it.

The specials saying about Dabda?

Dabda.

No, they sing about freeing Nelson Mandela.

Free Nelson about Dala.

Would it have killed them to make a song about Dabda?

What did it have?

Hey, is it distracting if I leave?

Yeah, I think so.

You got to get up near that mic.

But I think I can project.

These are not directional mics.

Hey, wouldn't have killed the specials to sing a song about Dabda?

Come on back.

Here we go.

All right.

Paul, we got to get to it.

This is your number five.

Number five.

All right.

Number five.

Just ought to be good.

Four weeks later.

Episode 554.

A double fortnight?

If you can believe it.

A double fortnight.

Are you playing Fortnite, by the way?

I've never played it.

Is it?

I don't know anything about it.

All I know is everyone plays it and someone does a dance in it.

Everyone plays it.

That's it.

These are little emotions.

Is it a game?

It's a game.

But then if you do something you can, a lot of games have this where you can, I forget what that goddamn just came up the other day.

There's a thing that you do that you can do after like a little victory move or something.

A celebratory move or something.

Yes.

And one of them is the Carlton.

The Carlton from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

That's right.

But as Dave, the parents, not understanding.

As Dave Holmes pointed out on Twitter and caught a lot of heat for it, but he's not wrong.

It was started.

That move absolutely was created by Belinda Carlisle.

Oh, the mad about you, of course.

Yes.

Yeah, exactly.

She did it when I went to see her Jimmy Pardo and I went to see her recently.

Why wouldn't she do it?

Of course she's going to do it.

She's great at Carlisle.

She's great at that goddamn Carlisle.

Of course she's going to do the Carlton.

Then it was stolen by Bruce Springsteen, dancing in the dark.

Well, I must say that was- I modified Belinda.

That was first.

Dancing in the dark was first in then Belinda.

No.

That's just how everyone danced back then though.

I danced like that when I was in junior high.

Did you really?

Yeah.

That's like the only- because it feels stupid to dance funky.

You know what I mean?

It's the 80s and you're in junior high.

Are you saying funky?

Funky.

Get in my belly.

Funky.

Alright, this is episode 554.

This is an episode called Educainment Squad.

And I have to say this is one of my favorite episodes that I did this year.

Are they going to say I have to say I don't like this one.

Not my cup of tea.

Number 5?

Weird.

No, this was- I had a ball do in this one.

This is with Thomas Middleditch and Horatio Sands.

And I'll tell you what happened on this episode.

Of course, if you're listening to this, I've talked about this many years previous.

We don't know what's going to happen on this show.

A lot of time.

True.

It will go- it runs the gamut from people coming in and bringing something that they want to talk about.

But I have no idea where we're going to go to people themselves not even knowing what they're going to do.

And Thomas and Horatio are two people who usually don't know what they're going to do and put no thought into it.

But this- Great to finally get them together.

This one was really fun because Thomas, and you'll hear it in the clip, I start talking to him as Lyle Cummings.

He just had a name, Lyle Cummings.

And he is a Southern Sherbet salesman.

And he tells us about that before he- we kind of run out of things to talk about in terms of Sherbet, or it gets too crazy, I can't recall.

So he's like, well, that wasn't my- I haven't always been that.

I've had other jobs.

And so we talk about his first job, which was he was hired to choke out middle schoolers.

He just threw that out there.

And I said, well, what do you mean by that?

Why are they hiring you to do this?

And he explained that it was so popular with teenagers to try to asphyxiate each other, that they realized they needed to hire an adult to do it safely at the schools.

Okay.

So that's the backstory you need to know.

But he starts to- I start saying like, why did they hire you?

And he says, well, you have to call our superintendent to find out.

And he just threw that out there.

And luckily we had the working telephone apparatus in the studio, which does not always work sometimes.

Oh, is that so?

I've tried to get it hooked up several times before and after, and it's a craft shoot as to whether it's going to work.

So a lot of times when someone's doing a phone call, they'll try to do it like this, and they'll cover the mic and they'll be like, hey, how you doing?

I'm Rod Chester from Rod Chester, New York.

I'll admit I've done that.

And I'm not too proud to admit I've done that.

You're very proud though.

I'm very prideful.

And it goes before a fall.

Which truly does.

I'm hoping to see that fall today.

I hope the seven guy kills me pride style.

So normally people just cover the mic or whatever, but we had the working phone hooked up to the board.

And Horatio, I think you'll hear it in this clip, Thomas Azlau Cummings says, well, you got to call the superintendent and we're like, yeah, and I'm gesturing over to get the phone.

And I can't remember if it was you, Sam, if you were there.

You were there.

He was nodding his ass.

Sam was there and Sam, you either hooked it up or however it was already hooked up.

I'm not really sure.

Don't get on my and.

And, but thankfully we handed it over to Horatio and Horatio just ran with it and created this character of Peppers McGilli.

So let's listen to this truly insane episode called, educate in squad.

This is your number five.

Number five.

What is the purpose of having you there?

If you don't have medical equipment, if you're not undergoing any kind of safety equipment.

You're going to have to call the superintendent.

Should I?

Are you still doing it?

I got his number.

You're still telling it.

You're still telling it?

Yeah.

No, no, no.

I only did it for a couple years.

I'm telling you that stuff sticks with you.

Okay.

Let's, let's call him.

Here we go.

What's his name?

Uh, uh, pet penis.

What?

I just joking.

What if he does?

You're joking.

Okay.

No, I was going to say it.

His name was something weird like that.

Pepper.

Oh, Peppers McGilli.

Peppers McGilli.

All right.

Let's call him.

Can we get Peppers online?

Here we go.

You have his number.

Great.

Okay.

You're putting it in.

Peppers McGilli.

Hey, superintendent.

And I believe, I don't know if he still is, but 88, 89, he certainly was.

And this was his part of the program.

We'll just call this school.

These kids.

We're calling the school right now and, uh, hello.

Hi.

Hey, this is.

Hello.

This Peppers.

Peppers McGilli.

I remember my voice.

It's loud comings.

Hi, how are you?

Hey, buddy.

I was, uh, you know, I strangled the town.

Oh, man.

This is a great, uh, it's last to hear your voice again.

Pleasure to hear your voice too.

Oh, heck.

We were just talking other deals over there at Barnum's and, uh, they were saying, where are you that guy going?

I was like, well, I don't know if you can probably choke them kids out in some other town over there.

No, I got out of that game years ago.

I'm selling Sherbert now.

Oh, good for you.

Out of a truck or something.

Out of a truck.

Hey, I got the Peppers radio host here.

Hi, Scott Ocharman here from Comedy Bang Bang.

Hey, look at there.

How are you, Scott?

I'm good.

You ever seen my television show?

Oh, yeah.

I've seen it.

I look, I look past it and, uh, and I, some of it makes me real, real happy.

Okay.

Well, great.

Um, I'm sorry about the other parts.

I'm all, you know, I, I got children and a wife.

I can't just sit in front of television.

I said all day like so people.

Okay.

So I'm going to go back to the show.

I'm going to go back to the show.

Dickey.

You could still see.

That's too bad.

How does it affect your life then, Lyle?

A lot of people think I'm just ready to go when I'm just trying to order a burger.

I still have my badge.

What badge do you have?

I was issued a standard issue, in the Dominican County, Georgia, educationment.

There was a business.

That's like educating with entertainment.

That's right.

It's a term we came up with here that I fostered in a few sheriffs of, you know, an edutainment sheriffs.

So you were issued a badge.

Why didn't peppers, why didn't you collect his badge?

You weren't issued a service weapon either, were you?

I had two revolvers.

I was trained in a kimbo technique.

A kimbo technique.

I was just trained in a dual pistol.

That's where you're using both at the same time.

I was trained to use both at the same time.

Okay.

And you were issued two service revolvers and a badge.

I'm sorry.

Scott, do you think that somehow we didn't, for some reason, didn't strangle these kids in front of a live audience?

I guess I, I guess I thought you were doing it off to the side.

I have to find.

Oh, okay.

No, no, we, we, we, a live audience not of kids.

At lunchtime, we corralled them into the gym.

We had an outfit from Los Angeles that kind of helped us stream.

So an audience coordinator?

Yeah.

Now you gotta understand this was early, late 80s, early 90s.

So streaming, you were getting that little printout, a dot matrix.

Sure.

And it was printout after printout, but you would, you would clearly be able to see, an adult strangling a team.

Okay.

And, uh, we made beta videos and, uh, they're all like, just videos.

To what end?

Were you selling these or?

Yeah, we're selling them the raise money for, uh, to raise this wall.

To stop.

The wall I want, the memorial wall for, for stranglers.

So wait, you are hiring stranglers to pay for a wall to memorialize the stranglers that you hired?

The snake was eating its tail.

There's no doubt.

Stop.

You gotta understand.

It's the bureaucracy in any township.

You're gonna find in any county that you have to deal with a lot of it.

Yeah.

You have to understand when I came in to, to the, to the scene, to these teens, you have to understand that there was about four to five teens dying.

So between, between four and five, between four to five teens.

You had to celebrate a teen some other county, just to fill up the seats.

Just to plump the numbers.

Now they were dying every day from self strangulation.

Unsupervised strangulation.

So that's why we brought in the task force.

The, the CTP.

The CTP.

Okay.

And that's why I got my badge.

That's why I was trained in dual pistols.

A kimbo technique.

Right.

Where are the others trained in the similar technique or everyone specialized?

Okay.

So it was like the dirty dozen where a couple, there was one feller who was last look at Tana.

Hey, someone else had ninja stars.

It's true.

Why you were there?

One guy could throw a plane cart into a watermelon.

Okay.

So this is like the suicide squad or something.

I'll just, I don't.

It's a rag tag group of.

Wait, we're really a part of anything in their own world.

But much like the suicide squad, were you putting collars, explosive collars around their necks in order to blow up their brains if they didn't comply with your wishes?

I, I, I did have, we did put the bomb around one guy and then you went, no, robbed the bank.

Claim that yeah, that was bad idea.

We shouldn't have sickled him out for no reason.

He was, we did him, but we had the lock neck devices that we had on a lot of the fellows because that was part of the, the probation.

Well, everyone was on probation.

Maybe ever more on probation.

Is your own probation?

At the time, yes.

Okay.

Because I was, I was still in and out of jail for all that dick suck and I've been doing.

Okay.

So that was before this job.

Okay.

Sure.

You have to understand that when, when the day, when the whistle blew and the CTP had finished their work day, we weren't allowed to go home.

We were all put down in the, you finished your work day.

You're not allowed to go.

We were all put down in the basement of the school.

Oh, okay.

Our necks were chained to each other.

Okay.

In the basement.

We had housing issues right from the get go.

Okay.

So peppers, you're, you're incarcerating these people.

In a way.

Yeah.

In every way, they're unable to leave.

They're, they're chained to each other.

Apparently you're at a school that doesn't have bells ringing.

It has whistles blowing at the end of the day.

Well, we had a lot of unwelcomed attention from people outside the county that wanted to participate and become stranglers, maybe for not the best reasons.

I don't think the people who you hired are doing it for the best reasons.

I'm doing it for the kids.

Oh, the kids.

So they wouldn't, yeah, to, to, so they wouldn't choke each other out and maybe do it in a dangerous way.

We had supervised trokers and stranglers coming into all these schools.

Yeah.

I know the premise.

And we had, I guess we had started getting the wrong type of fella, wrong type of a fella that was kind of just choking everybody.

So we have a chamber here.

And you want, well, we'll drop a name because he's the hombos.

So we can't do no more harm.

Oh, really?

What's his name?

Tugget, tonk, tonk, tonk.

Yeah, big feller.

And he's behind bars.

Seven foot to hands like grapes.

Just a big guy.

Wait, his hands are like grapes.

This big old, you know, big grapes.

Like a whole, like a whole, but the grapes, grapes are about, oh, like a bunch.

Okay.

I was going to say.

So you're going to go and punch your mind and play some bag and pick me weak.

Okay.

Got it.

So he's got a hands, hands that are slightly bigger than hands.

They big old hands and this fella would stomp around.

You knew he was coming.

You knew to ever, to be, it was coming.

Right.

And he, he may be, yeah, he, he may have been in it for the wrong reasons.

Hashtag wrong.

Why is he incarcerated currently?

I believe it's so incarcerated currently.

Yes, that's right.

Currently.

We're just dropping hashtags on the show, by the way.

If you want to use any of them, why you tweet about the show, I'd really appreciate it.

Making education squad.

Okay.

I'm not sure that you want any attention drawn to what you're doing at the school.

What's up.

Are you still talking about tub it?

Yeah, we're talking about.

I'm trying to thank the reason why he's.

Is he still, he's still incarcerated?

He's incarcerated.

Peppers.

He talked, he talked us into a new method, joke kids out where he would just sit on for several seconds.

Okay.

And one afternoon he just sat on a group of like seven kids.

I'm like, they were.

And that was what he was arrested for?

It seemed.

He was finally arrested.

For what?

Because he was doing it in bulk.

Yeah, after understanding Scott, he was alluding police for years.

Oh, we would, we would find these kids out.

A kid would come to me.

I put my hands up to his neck or his or her neck.

And I'd see there on the chest.

I say butt marks.

I say, what the heck is going on?

When you say butt marks, it means like skid marks or the impression of a butt.

You could see the rivets on the chains.

You know, you could see the butt mark.

I see.

And I have a one symbol.

I was saying someone, I said, I remember saying to you, I said, someone isn't strangling these kids.

Someone is sitting on them.

Okay.

So, and that's, did you hear sussles going on and police couldn't find a suspect.

We thought we were coming by.

They're fine with everything except for someone sitting on the kids.

This was a door.

Are the police in your pocket or something?

No, they're not in there.

They are good friends of ours.

I mean, we all know each other.

We recognize a problem, but they were the one that helps us organize the arena aspect of it because the parking coordinator, you know, sometimes these kids wouldn't get fully passed out and there would be a ride on the hands and parents will say, I want you to choke my kid again.

It didn't pass out.

And I said, ma'am, a major child passed out.

You know, it would be a bit sometimes they would get into turn into riots.

Right.

So we need to.

Peppers, you have just strange ideas about education.

Now, why, how did you ever get interested in, in acquiring this job?

Well, my mother, who my lived with, um, we all do that usually unless, you know, our mothers until about a week ago.

Oh, when she passes.

Um, so.

So we could go work.

Was it?

We say about a week ago.

What about about what day is it today?

I don't know.

Today's Monday.

So it's been about a week.

She, she, she lived to him.

Rap all day.

Cause you're nine.

Yeah.

She was a hundred twenty six.

Oh my God.

Well, this woman in all of the world.

Wow.

Congratulations on that fact, although now she is not, but you know, it's a thing.

She's been around so long.

There's like enough already kind of, you know, it's too bad when you die.

You know, you automatically no longer have that, uh, that record anymore.

You know what I mean?

That's like the only record that you can have that you can lose by dying.

Like if you're the person who, uh, ate, you know, the most amount of hot dogs in a minute or whatever, you don't lose that when you die.

But if you're oldest person and you die, you're no longer the oldest person.

It's really sad.

Unless you're the oldest person, like the living ever.

Right.

Yeah.

No, that's the only one of those.

Yeah.

Who's that?

Who, who, who, who, no, we're still on the line.

Who's the oldest?

Yeah.

You brought the person up.

I see.

She's had summers.

Okay.

Enough with the jokes.

But this is but now, but tub it, tub it.

We found tub it was just sitting on kids and smashing the left.

Okay.

So it took several years, but you found tub it.

Turned it out.

Yeah.

He had to go away.

He's frustrated now for 30 years about just for sitting on seven kids.

Well, he keeps getting into trouble in jail.

This is, yeah, you got to understand, tub it's not the feller that would get let out a Honkaan Goobie haven't.

Right.

Okay.

He's got a twinkle in his eyes that says, I'm up to no good.

Okay.

I solemnly swear I'm up to no good.

He's solemnly swear with a twinkle in my eye though.

Yeah.

He's on a macrobiotic diet that I swear he grows.

He's in prison.

He's out to seven four.

Oh, oh, I see he grows.

He doesn't grow the food.

He's he grows in height.

I see.

He's grown.

He's grown about one inch this whole time.

So he used to be he used to be six eleven seven three when I knew him.

Oh, okay.

And I'm just hearing now he's up seven four.

That's a four.

That's an inch over a considerable amount of time.

You have to understand.

30 years.

Yeah.

I don't know how if you're still growing that's that stop for me.

No, I'm not.

Normally people shrink.

The older they go.

But now he's on this macrobiotic diet.

Oh, interesting.

Well, congratulations to him.

We're building a statue for him.

Your building is just a race.

Just to raise awareness is somehow how sometimes people can go wrong.

It doesn't mean they're wrong.

He's more of a scarecrow in a sense.

Oh, I see.

He's a ward of evil.

Well, peppers, did we ever get to your mother passed away?

How did you get interested in education?

Oh, I pretended to be my mother for about 15 years.

Just took on her job and eventually I learned a job and then I wanted to ask that you know and I'm not in a dressing drag anymore.

I'm not going to pretend to be my mother.

So your mother had this job in the 70s and 60s or so?

Yeah, it was in the late 70s.

Yeah, she started in the 50s.

She started, okay.

So she was there for a long time.

You slowly started.

You still started.

I don't, I get it.

I don't have to imagine it.

I tell you 50s, just imagine that.

I've seen back to the future.

So I have a vague rough idea.

But and then one day you just slowly took over her job by dressing as her going to work.

You look a lot alike, Avi.

Right.

And you got it.

You put yourself in her shoes.

You show up to work and you're all.

That's what you did.

Well, no, put yourself.

Scott, enough of your jokes.

Hey.

You got to understand that you put yourself in her shoes in the sense you go to, you go to work and you're already there.

You say, what a minute.

Well, that's hell.

I'm going to go.

I'm gone fishing or something.

You don't know what you're going to take a break.

You put, you get yourself to work and you're already there.

Oh, her.

Oh, she's, she's saying I'm going to go to work and then and then and then she sees she's already there.

She's already there.

You know, as her already, she's going to say, well, I guess I'm already.

You're down to go.

I don't know.

You get a pedicure.

Is that what happened?

Or did you?

For the first, first couple of months, you know, people were acting strange and saying like you're not her.

What are you doing?

You don't know anything about this job.

She knew things.

Where is she?

What have you done to her?

This kind of thing.

Right.

Did you do something to her or?

No, I did.

I did.

I told her she said I'm tired of working and it's time for you to start working and she came up with this idea.

Oh, she did.

Okay.

Wow.

And wow.

And this was she was she was about your age now back then.

Well, it freed her up to do all kinds of things.

It really did.

I mean, she's actually kind of a local hero around our parts.

Oh, really.

She could do it as herself.

No, she had to take on his.

She had to take on mom.

Oh, okay.

So you guys just switched clothes essentially.

It's crazy.

We get her done which way one way or the other.

Isn't she?

Yeah.

Okay.

You know what they say?

You try and deliver a calf with your feet.

You're the one going inside.

At what point, peppers, if I'm asked, did you stop dressing up as your mother and what was the reaction then?

It was about five years ago.

Five years ago.

So this is a long time.

This is, I mean, the late the eighties, the late eighties at least through 2013 or so.

You were dressing up as your mother.

I knew I knew peppers mainly as a smile.

Okay.

You never mentioned that.

So that's why you were having so much trouble coming up with his name earlier is because you knew.

I was like, oh wait, is this?

Oh, yeah.

Right.

He became peppers.

Yeah.

Five years ago.

I'm on the email chain.

So I got the update.

Oh, okay.

So and what was the reaction to this?

When I came when I finally when you find myself and my grandmother and my mother came back to being herself.

Yeah.

People were like, whatever.

I mean.

No big surprise to them.

They knew something was they just thought that was your thing.

They're like, why are you doing that for so long?

And I said, I don't know.

Maybe I kind of fell in love with that.

And it was true.

I did.

I did marry Don Carsedale for the Bible.

I was a great wife to him for sitting here.

You're a great wife to your own dad.

I guess.

Yes.

Okay.

So.

Hey guys, is that your special laugh in your.

Hey, you ain't going to go away from my county Georgia.

I haven't had life.

Yeah.

So so so what happened to Don was Don an older gentleman, I guess.

I mean, I do.

Don't do anything to clarify this.

You were you would assume you dated your you.

You were married.

I was married.

You were married to your mom's.

No, you got married.

You met someone in fell in love with him as while you were dressed as your mother and you married him.

Yes.

Okay.

Yes.

So and where is your actual father peppers passed away or?

Oh, yeah.

He passed away.

Okay.

So she was free to marry whomever she liked.

He passed away when he was 26.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

My mother was a widow.

Yeah.

So widow.

So you don't have to put a female spin on waste.

He's the board of education super time.

Okay.

I beg your pardon.

Yeah.

So she was a widow for 85 years.

So long.

And so you decided time to get her hitched.

Was this all for her or was it a man that you fell in love with?

You know, it was for the job to keep to keep the income to keep the house open and but, you know, some things happen.

You spent time with someone you work with and you started having feelings for the person.

Oh, did Don work at the school?

He's trying to get you're trying to get papers to explain love.

I know love is inexplicable and, you know, whomever you choose to love is is your thing.

I just did Don ever figure out that you were not your mother?

No.

Good.

No, I couldn't do that to him.

Yeah.

He was a very sweet man.

Did he pass away or why were you only married seven years?

He did.

He passed away.

I'm so sorry.

His, uh, his Jeep rolled right into him.

His Jeep just rolled right into him.

Yeah.

So he was still driving at it.

He didn't put it in park and yeah.

He rolled a minute with, rolled into his living room while he was watching into his living room.

He's watching some golf and he's rolled into his own Jeep, rolled into his living room, crushed him.

Wow.

And I love that man.

This is it your mom's house, I would imagine where what were you and your mom because your mom was dressed as you and you were dressed as your mom.

My mother, my mother was bathing me upstairs.

So, but to Don's view, the son is bathing.

My mother.

Okay.

And you have no question to ask, which is a fortune for all of us.

Okay.

Sometimes you slide into certain scenarios where you didn't know you were going to be comfortable with.

Yeah.

But, and so your mom enjoyed being young and being you and you know, who doesn't enjoy this stuff?

Oh, man.

She, they came a real metal head with that beanie on the propeller on the back and go in the middle.

Yeah.

It's concert and drives flying around on a scooter, a razor scooter.

She loved it and you loved what you were doing and you were in love with Don and what a terrible tragedy that sounds awful.

I'm sorry to hear about that.

And you guys were upstairs and suddenly you hear all this crashing, I would imagine.

And you're like, Hey, wait a minute.

Is this Pete Holmes on HBO?

What is going on here?

All right.

So, uh, I'm sorry guys.

I got to go.

Oh, I got to work.

All right.

Well, I'm sorry.

Guys, I got to go.

All right.

Well, what do you have to do today besides taking the books out of first graders right now?

I'm picking out precious metals to build that statue.

You're picking them out, meaning you're just choosing.

Well, there's a salesman here, the statue salesman.

We're going to try to make this out of the most expensive, most durable metal we can find.

Well, you've been raising money for it for 30 years.

Yeah.

Please go to making middle school, Tennyson, Georgia, tippettfund statue.com and please give what you can.

I don't think anyone is going to give money to erect a statue of a seven foot porridge incarcerated child killer with hands the size of bunches of grapes.

Just a real murderous among us.

Well, that's why it's a warning to the future generations.

Don't be like him.

This is one of the most important statues the area has ever dared to erect.

And we got about a statue for just about everything.

Okay.

All right.

Children need to be afraid of something when they're growing up.

And since they can't go to the jail, they might as well have a boogeyman.

I'm a boogeyman.

All right.

I've always said, might as well have a boogeyman.

Might as well have a boogeyman.

Might as well have a boogeyman to you.

All right.

Bye bye.

Number five.

Oh boy.

So funny.

So insane.

These boys are nuts.

They're legitimately, sorry.

I mean, they're.

Insane.

There are a couple of cooks.

I sometimes worry when I'm in the studio with them that they are going to fly into a murderous rage and end me.

Oh, so you fear for your safety.

I truly do.

Yeah.

I'm just recording episodes of them.

Obviously, this was just a few weeks later after we talked to Hot Dog and I obviously had hot dogs on the mind because I believe I bring them up in that clip.

You obviously had hot dogs on the mind.

And I think sometime around here, I remember it being National Hot Dog month or week or something.

Yeah.

And me having, I took a picture on my phone of a chart of hot dogs from around the world.

And I remember like being with Koolop in a kind of rather serious place and me, her, her, her kind of like peering over my shoulder going, what are you looking at?

Because I was smiling.

I was looking at a picture of hot dogs from around the world.

I love hot dogs that much.

I was looking at all the various variations of hot dogs and how they serve them around the world.

Yeah, there's just pictures of hot dogs.

Yes.

You're just smiling.

Yeah.

So I think it was around this time that we, we recorded both of these.

These episodes.

Brilliant.

Hot dog rain.

Yeah.

A lot of hot dogs on the mind.

That was a pleasure to record.

Those guys are wonderful.

And the whole thing about Pepper's swapping places with his mother and living as her while she lived is.

No, I noticed the ones, any of the ones that I've been in so far, you haven't said, you, I remember how much I love doing this.

This was a pleasure to record.

Now Scott, how am I supposed to take that?

I think I might have alluded to it.

Well, an illusion.

Life is an illusion.

Is it?

It truly, have you ever thought about that?

What if life is a dress rehearsal?

I mean, I feel good for the opposite before.

What if it were a dress rehearsal?

We don't know.

I know race is a construct.

Right.

Life is not a dress rehearsal?

No, what if it was?

How crazy would that be?

We could do whatever we wanted.

Well, what about the people who have died?

Aren't they part of the show?

The people who have died died.

Oh, the great Jim Carole Band.

The Jim Carole Band.

What's that movie they made about him?

The Basketball Diaries.

Is that about him or is that based on a book he wrote?

It's or a memoir that he wrote about himself.

He wrote about himself.

Look, these guys are all selfish.

They self-absorbed their narcissists.

They're not giving people like us, talking about the Thomas Middle Ditches and her ratio sandes of the world.

Narcissists, right?

This was a guy.

Here's this guy.

He was so all about himself that they were like, we're going to name this after you.

Still to this day, people are like, you know what I mean?

Narcissists.

That's so much you talk about yourself.

That was the way we said it to people.

You know who you're minding up?

I mean, this guy, Narcissists.

Narcissists.

He looked at his own reflection in the pond or whatever.

Fell in love with that shit.

Yeah, then he opened his mouth.

The bone fell out.

Someone booted him in the button.

He fell in the pond.

He was going to get two bones, only the other one.

Bye, dumb, dumb.

All right, let's go to a break.

When we come back, we're going to have episode four and this is exciting.

We're getting so close to one, but we will stop after four.

But we are going to hear episode four after this.

This builds the tension.

It truly does in an expert manner.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Let's expert manner.

Comedy bang bang best of 2018.

And I tell you, these years, they just keep going along.

Don't they had a certain plan?

It'll be 29.

I never thought I would live to see 2019.

This fucking shit.

Let me tell you something tomorrow is going to be 2019.

Scott, stop saying it.

I don't like, I don't like all these years.

I don't like it.

It's like, I know how old I am.

You don't need to remind me fucking every time I write a check.

Really?

I don't know.

Anyway, 2019 tomorrow.

You got any resolutions?

My main resolution, I guess, now is to get all that cat litter out of my bathtub.

I didn't know that was a weird thing until that story.

I told it like it was a real weird...

Yeah, I'm now...

Attribute.

Now I'm seeing it through your eyes.

And I'm like, yeah, that's crazy.

Through my...

Sam just turned on every light in the control room.

I moved back a studio.

Yeah, he's like, I gotta get out of here.

Oh, he disappeared.

He turned him out.

Oh boy.

I wish you guys could see Sam.

This is the real show over here.

I wish you could see the screen savers on the laptops in here.

All the monitors.

Yeah, it is so fun in here.

I wish you could see Chewbacca's angry face.

Oh yeah, we can talk about Chewbacca's angry face.

He's as angry as I've ever seen him.

I think he actually looks very sad.

Like he looks like he's grieving.

He really does.

He's a superman on the cover of Crisis on Infinite Earth's 10 or whatever when he's holding supergirl and crying.

Oh yeah.

Because she's dead.

Yeah.

He looks a lot like that.

Do you think there will ever be a best up where we don't talk about Star Wars?

No.

Because they'll keep making these things.

Well they'll certainly keep making those dishes.

Next, yeah.

Someday Star Wars will go away, but these tissues will still be around.

Some of these Star Wars will go away, but the tissues remain forever.

By the time we do the best of us next year, Star Wars Episode 9 will be out.

We'll talk about that.

Wow.

X.

Exactly.

Red Dead Redemption.

What's the name of that called?

Red Dead Redemption?

Red Dead Redemption the third might be out by then.

How long does it take to make one of those red dead, did you do that since?

One of the games?

Yeah, one of the games probably takes years, right?

It takes four years, five years to make these.

Yes.

And then there was a big, there was a big scandal.

Because they were, the company was making their people work crazy hours to get it finished.

Oh, right.

To get it finished by the release deadline.

Yeah.

Well that always happens with anything.

Yeah.

But it's like, you know, do a little...

Delay it?

You want to do the later.

Yeah.

I wouldn't have minded it.

If I, the game is very good, like the quality of it is astounding.

It's a vast game.

Right.

Like you can play it for days and days and days.

And I would not have minded waiting.

In fact, I thought it was going to come out later.

But all the promotional aspects of it are...

This is the problem when like you two rushes to...

Wait, is this an episode of you talking you two to me?

No.

Oh, okay.

When you two is like rushing to meet a release date, it's because all...

It's not like the record stores wouldn't be like, yeah, yeah, sure.

We'll put it out three weeks late.

It's because all of the promotion is wrapped up into it.

Like, you know...

That's it.

Like they've already paid for all of that promotion when it comes out.

But I mean like playing your ship better.

You know what I mean?

I don't know.

It just seemed...

Yeah.

Yes, all the promotions paid for.

But...

And who knows what unforeseen problems they're seeing.

But I've also heard that those people are like, they're not exactly...

Which people are the programmers?

No, not the programmers.

The people that run the...

People in red...

Yeah, the Cowboys.

Cowboys.

Oh no.

I heard those Cowboys are not easy to deal with.

Okay.

Well, that adds an extra layer of difficulty with this job.

I got to play the...

I hear it's great.

Do you play games at all?

I did.

I tell you when I was hanging out over...

Remember GoldenEye.

Of course.

GoldenEye.

Those were the years.

There were maybe a three year period when I was hanging out at Brian Possain's house with Doug Benson where we would play...

Here are the games I like.

When that Mario...

No, what am I talking about?

The Nintendo, not the GameCube, but the one before it.

When that system came out.

Game sphere.

No, when...

Nintendo 64.

Maybe that was it.

It was 3D graphics.

You know, and you had GoldenEye and instead of being flat, that was the 64.

Okay, so when the Mario game came out and the Legends of Zelda and Mario Kart came out like, oh, those were my golden years.

I love those.

I love adventure games.

I would probably like Red Dead Redemption because I like solving puzzles and walking around and you know...

Do you know what games you would like if you liked that?

Is those Batman games.

The Nightfall or whatever it is?

Or Asylum and all that.

Yeah, those games are a good mix of puzzle solving and like shooting shit, punching shit.

I don't like the ones where you're just like fighting people all the time.

You know, but I...

I mean, there's a lot of fighting, but it's also...

There's a lot of puzzles to figure out.

I like the Zelda...

I mean, the Riddler's in it.

Yeah, that's true.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I like the Zelda aspect of like, you know, wandering around looking for a quest, fighting pieces of puzzles and stuff.

What's they called Sandbox games?

Oh, is that what they call it?

Okay.

Then I got a free Xbox and they sent me a whole bunch of games.

Nice.

And I don't think I ever took them out of the packaging.

But I did play Guitar Hero for a bit and that was the last video game I've ever played.

And we have these systems at my house and we've never cracked them open.

But I would like to play that Spider-Man game and I hear that's really good.

I heard that's very good too.

I am an Xbox person that's on PS4, which I guess I have to get if I want to fucking play that game.

Oh, oh, puppy.

And his Red Dead Redemption on all systems or is it just on?

I believe it's on all systems.

It's on all systems.

All right.

Maybe I will play it.

Tell you what, why don't we make this the year where I get into video games?

Oh, God.

That's all you need.

I'll play piano and you learn how to tap dance.

So our big reveal at whatever party this is is I'll play piano while you tap dance and then I'll sit down and play video games for six hours while people watch me.

Yeah.

I'll do a Twitch about it.

Yeah.

And I'll just watch you over there.

Can you imagine having a Twitch where we just played video games?

People would like it, I bet.

People would, if people like Twitch at all, they might as well like it if we do it.

Let's do it.

Let's do the Shakespeare Avengers.

I get requests for that.

If ever I post on Twitter or something about a video game, there's always someone who says, please, I want to see you play these games.

I did that Conan show where you go in and they interview.

Conan, who?

Oh, Brian.

Oh, yeah.

Where they, where they, you play video games and you're being interviewed while you play video games and people like it for some reason because they like watching people play video games and I didn't know how to play any of the games and I thought I was just there for an interview but it turned out to be this thing and people were so upset that I didn't know how to play the games.

Really?

He doesn't know how to play.

I played on a video games on a show with Tim Balz.

You played GoldenEye together.

Isn't he number six on the call sheet or number?

No, he's higher up there.

He's maybe four.

Ryan is number six.

Okay.

He's four.

No, Mandelman is number four.

Oh, he's three.

Tim is number three.

Yeah.

Tim is number two and then guess who's number one.

Number one.

I think it was in reverse order of them being hired.

Oh, shit.

Don't tell them that.

You can't tell them.

I mean, they have a general.

Dan knows he was hired first.

It what?

Dan knows he was hired first.

I think he does because he never, because anyone forget it.

No, but I've mentioned this on stage.

We're talking about, we talked about this in a previous episode.

Folks, you're talking about bajillion dollar properties.

Hopefully there may be some news about that this year.

I'm hoping in 2019, but we're just talking about the order on the call sheet that all the actors are on and stuff.

Which is extremely important.

And they all fight about it all the time.

Well, I'm very proud of us for not fighting about it and recognizing the most important thing is that I'm number one.

That's right.

You are number one.

How many shows were you number one on the call sheet on?

I'm guessing best week ever.

Oh, that anyone ever saw?

No, just a different category.

The ones that people saw.

No, just general.

Oh, general.

Yeah, we got no, you shut up.

No, you shut up.

Best week ever.

Bajillion dollar properties.

I've done two pilots where I was one of the calls.

Oh, great.

Oh, sorry.

Three.

Which pilots release?

1321 Clover.

The Peter Prince of whole.

What was that other one called?

Oh, shit.

Untitled Bambi Cottage's project.

It was going to be called Bambi Cottage's, but that was a real place.

And so they weren't sure if they were going to be used that luckily it became a non-issue.

So you've been number one so many times.

A few times, man.

A few times.

Me, just once.

Just on your show?

Yeah, just on my show.

You had to create a show to make that happen.

I know.

That's so sad, man.

I really do have a sad, sad career.

Paul.

I think we got to get to it.

We got to get to the last episode in our...

We have to, Scott.

We got to get to our last episode in our countdown today and that is episode number four.

Number four.

All right.

This is episode number four and this is episode number when you're counting it in terms of comedy bang bang episodes and not where it is on the countdown.

This is episode 540.

That's right.

So shut up.

Everyone who said episode 540 couldn't be number four.

Never be number four.

Yeburt.

You're dusted.

You're faced.

This is an episode called low five.

Mmm.

Low five.

Ringing any bells?

It's ringing five bells.

Really?

It's five o'clock.

Wait.

I'll wait for the cuckoo.

Cuckoo.

Oh, two.

Cuckoo.

Four.

Cuckoo.

Five.

Oh.

That echo really helps.

You're right.

This is an episode called low five and it's with our friend John Hamm.

I know him.

Who people know from TV's Madman.

He's the madman himself.

I know him from tag.

That's true.

He was in tag this year.

And in fact, I'm not going to lie, he might have been promoting tag on this episode.

I think he was.

Wait.

No, there was some other movie.

His other Beirut movie?

Yeah, the Burroot.

It was either.

Burroot is on fire.

We don't need no water.

We don't need to let the mother of our burn.

This has John Hamm in it.

This has Paul of Tomkins in it.

That's me and it has two people by the name of Jessa McKenna, Jessica McKenna.

That's like when people say Saturday Night Live.

Saturday Night Live.

That's I'm one of those people.

Saturday Night Live.

It's hard for me to say.

I got to really concentrate.

Jessica.

What did I say?

Jess McCann.

Jessa McCann.

It could get Jessa McKenna.

Jessica McKenna.

Jessa McCann.

And Zach Reno.

They are, you would know them from the off book, The Improvised Musical Podcast.

You should.

You should know it and you should listen to that because that's a wonderful podcast.

And they were on it together, although not doing characters together.

That's right.

And here's what you need to know about this episode.

Okay, previous to this clip, there's, look, the whole episode is great.

First we talked to the Husky voiced John Hamm.

And then we talked to the even Husker voice, smooth criminal, Al A. Peterson.

That's right.

And the things, if you don't know about Al A. Peterson, what are the things we need to remind everyone else?

He's completely hairless.

Right.

But by choice, he does not have Al Apeach.

He faked Al Apeach to get out of a long-term relationship.

Right.

With, by the way, the relationship was between him and someone, a woman named Carla Fert.

Carla Fert.

He's, you're right.

He helps people fake their own deaths by shaving their entire bodies.

Right.

And giving them a new passport.

He hates clumsy portmanteaus.

He hates Karloffer.

Well, we know that he hates one clumsy portmanteau in particular.

And I believe that he confronted Karloffers.

Yes, there's a fair story about it.

Where he confronted Karloffers dad, Karl.

Karl.

And his mother told him, told him it was a clumsy portmanteau.

Right.

And he faked a portmanteau.

He faked a portmanteau.

Like the sibling cowardly worm that he is.

He's a sibling of a worm and he's married to a vermouth drunk.

Yeah.

Meanwhile, Jennifer's in the other room just getting bombed on her move.

Just out of six bottle of vermouth.

Just trying to feel that feeling.

Yeah.

The other thing you need to know is he uses smoke bombs to escape.

Okay.

That's not, you know, an important part of it, of his canon overall.

It's certainly not a part that I remember.

It is for this episode.

Absolutely.

So I believe he may bust it out at a certain point.

We previous to this clip also, we're talking to Jessica McKenna, who is playing Park Ranger Marjorie Kershaw.

Mm hmm.

And the things you have to know about her is she is very concerned about Park visitors putting on sunscreen.

And she is very concerned about the separation between church and state.

So she's very religious and, but doesn't like to talk about it because she's a government employee.

I don't think she knows a lot about state parks.

She, that's why she wanted to do this character.

She knows a lot about, but I don't think that she's a person who necessarily collects that information.

I think she did all the research for doing the show.

I think she went on like some Wikipedia pages.

Oh, I was in the impression that she and her, like it was a thing with her and her family.

It could be maybe I'm misremembering, but I had thought it was something where she went on a Wikipedia page the night before and just memorized a bunch of stuff.

But maybe it's a combination of both or just what you said.

So those are the people who are talking before this clip, but I think the reason, and they're all great and the reason people voted for this episode is because it's a great episode all the way through.

But I think the reason it may be sticking in people's minds is because of the character that Zach Reno plays.

And he is playing, he is a trainer and he is basically play, you'll hear it, but he's playing something that has to do with the game.

I wanted to say video game, but it's not a video game.

It is just a game of Pokemon.

It's just a game in the largest sense of the word.

And he knows a lot about this game and you'll hear, I know I didn't know anything about it and I'm kind of trying to understand what he's talking about as...

I still don't, which makes me feel good.

I think I've got it from just listening to him talk about it a couple of times.

What I like when somebody does a thing like this where they, it's either they know it so thoroughly that they could just riff on it or they'd know nothing about it.

Right.

It could be either one to me.

He knows it very thoroughly and is riffing on it very specifically and people really enjoyed it, but you'll hear myself and Paul and I believe even John Hamm not quite knowing what he's talking about and that's part of the fun of this clip.

So I believe we talk about the, with the park ranger we mentioned the HBIC that had bear in charge a few times that may come up during this clip.

So let's listen to it.

This is your number four.

Number four.

He's a trainer.

Please welcome to the show Dash Grab them.

Hi Scott.

Hi.

It's over to meet you.

I'm Dash Grab them.

Yes you are.

You may have misunderstood what I do.

I do.

You're a trainer, right?

I am a Pokemon trainer, Scott.

I train Pokemon.

I catch them and subjugate them and train them for battles and we go on adventures across the land.

What's his now?

What is a Pokemon?

Pokemon is a pocket monster.

A small monster that you could subjugate and catch in a ball.

Where are you on this portmanteau?

Pocket monster.

Oh, because Pokemon.

Pokemon.

Pocket monster.

Pokemon.

You asked no one's on the line.

I've seen a lot of them around your area.

I'm not from around here.

Others are weird though.

I will give you that.

Have you seen them in the walls?

Maybe you're just thinking of your Junius bubble dooner.

No, I saw a bunch of them outside.

It would be piggies where I'm from but yours are different and they don't have any of the attacks at the ones that I have.

You tried to catch a pigeon?

Oh sure.

I caught like eight of them.

They have basically no battle skills.

They can run.

That's a good battle.

Or fly.

I'm pretty sure they can.

That's a nice skill.

That would be pretty useful if I didn't have a bunch of bird type Pokemon.

Which I do.

Wow, congratulations.

What do you keep all of these?

It must be difficult to store all these pocket monsters.

No, see, okay, so here's the Pokeball and see you just click this and it gets real small.

I'll keep them on my belt right here.

I only carry about six to eight of them at a time.

It's my battle lineup and the rest of them I put basically into the internet where they just live and sit around.

Is it like Bitcoin?

That's a currency that lives on the internet.

Crypto goods.

I don't think I can.

Is it more like Litecoin?

Is that another cryptocurrency?

I don't know that any of them have.

More like Haracoin?

I think of all of them.

It's the most like Haracoin.

Is it like the Charleston chew, which is a new cryptocurrency based on Charleston chew the candy by the don't likes?

I beg your pardon.

I should.

I love a Charleston chew.

I should clarify.

I'm sorry.

It is like Bitcoin in that it is very difficult to cash out because none of them as far as I know are directly exchangeable for money of any kind.

Okay.

Deshling has you a question.

Yeah.

You said these Pokemon as you call them.

They engage in battles.

All the time.

I make them do it.

Who are they battling?

Other Pokemon.

It's a big, big no-no to fight a person with a Pokemon.

Oh really?

That's a crime.

Yeah.

It's a crime in not in the United States.

What crime against nature?

You don't have a lot of rules pertaining to Pokemon in this country.

There's not a lot of Pokemon law.

Yeah.

Where I'm from is almost nothing but.

Where are you from?

I'm from the Kanto region.

Oh, okay.

Of?

Excuse me?

The Kanto region of?

Pardon?

So you're from the Kanto region.

Yeah, I'm from the Kanto region.

And you- Full stop.

That's all you need.

Can you train Pokemon to fight other loose Pokemon or do people own and subjugate these Pokemon as well?

Oh, thank you for asking us.

Oh, you're welcome.

The answer is both.

I love to use my Pokemon to fight wild Pokemon that I try to make faint.

You don't want to ever kill a Pokemon, but once you make it faint or almost faint, you can capture it.

And then you can take those Pokemon to poke gyms all around the world and you can battle at those gyms against other trainers and take their badges.

And if you get enough badges, you can become a Pokemon master.

And I just grab them.

I'm going to be Pokemon master.

What are you in the process?

I have one badge.

How many do you need to be a master?

More than one.

I've said two.

I mean, technically to be a Pokemon master, you have to catch them all.

And this is where it gets so frustrating to try them.

This is what I've heard.

You're the touch them all.

You've got to catch them all.

But catch them all.

You have to.

It is a compulsion.

And here's the problem.

Originally, when I became a Pokemon master, I'm 11 years old.

I started very, very well.

I was going to say, yeah.

I guess.

How old would you have said?

29.

I spent a lot of time in the sun.

You spent just 29, aren't you?

I spent a lot of time in the sun and I don't wear sunscreen in my hat.

It's always backwards.

Oh, no.

Look at that.

The cool way to wear it.

Oh boy, at least put on a sunscreen.

I don't.

Begging you.

I don't need to because I have coughing and he can cast smoke screen.

Okay.

Anyway, I forget what I was talking about.

Oh, you were talking about finding other Pokemon and catching them all is very difficult.

Oh yeah, because originally there were only 150 Scott.

Okay.

And that's like a big...

Yeah, one can... if one were to spend maybe 200 days, I can imagine one could cast them all.

That's a legitimate amount of time.

Two thirds of a year.

Al, can I ask you what kind of day?

You know, 42 hours?

Oh yeah, the 42 hours.

42 hours.

I mean, a day-root day.

Yeah.

42 hours.

I sleep like Al over here.

I don't mean to well actually all of you right now, but...

Uh oh.

200 days is a laughable amount of time to catch 150.

Okay.

Don't man explain to us about or kids playing, I guess, as well.

It's just...

I think...

Some of them are in saffron singing.

I think maybe...

Young man's playing.

Train's playing?

Because he's a trainer?

Oh, okay.

Train's playing.

Yeah.

Well, it's just that they're all over the world.

It takes a long time.

Oh.

But there were originally 150 and that was two of them.

But my Jackie Chan went around the world in 80 days.

Hey.

Jackie Chan.

Are you going to allow him to rock you?

He and Steve Coogan went around the world in 80 days, so it seems like it's 200 days is, you know, would be...

If you got very lucky, you could maybe do it.

How many...

How many Pokemon are in the Kanto region, let's just say?

There are 151 proper in the Kanto.

Now in the Kanto region.

So how many...

You can get a lot just in the Kanto region where you're from.

Well, that's all that we thought there were, and that's what you thought you had to do to catch them all.

It turns out every year or so, about 150 more get released and they get...

Oh, this sounds...

Banana's weird every time.

I'm really only familiar with the first 150 after that.

There's some weird, weird stuff out there, you guys.

There's a bear.

You would like that one.

Well, I have a healthy respect for it.

You wouldn't like this bear.

This bear, as I understand it, blasts fire out of its mouth.

Oh, gosh.

Well, that is, I think that is the HBIC for sure.

I would definitely be the HBIC.

Huge bear I caught.

You have caught and trained this bear.

Oh yeah, I have another...

I have a water type Pokemon.

Can I ask that bear?

What is the name of that bear?

What is the name of that bear Pokemon?

His name is sitting in the internet right now.

Oh, the name of the species?

Yeah.

An Ursa Ring.

Ursa Ring.

Oh, that's clever.

Makes sense.

It's based on the left.

The big bear has got a big literal ring on his stomach.

Okay.

How do you feel about that portmanteau?

Kind of fly upside down, then.

Ursa Ring.

One is part of his Latin name for bear and then he has a ring around him.

It's a portmanteau, but it's an Earth sign and telephone ring.

That's a clumsy portmanteau.

Sorry, you've been judged clumsy portmanteau.

CP.

Ursa Ring.

Anyway, I battle him and now he lives the internet.

So how do you bet, because I thought it was against the rules to battle a human for a Pokemon to battle a human?

It was just frowned upon.

And where I'm from it is actually illegal to use the force in the cantorage and to use the force of a Pokemon against the human.

But you're battling these Pokemon?

Yes.

Like, for example, I would have a Pokemon.

I would probably, if I was battling you, for example.

Wait, I'm not a Pokemon.

No, no, no.

You would be a Pokemon trainer.

Oh, okay.

I believe you would bring your Pokemon and then it would set them on each other.

For example, which one do you choose?

Out of my Pokemon?

Sure.

I'll choose Ursa Ring.

You're an idiot because I'm going to bring a water Pokemon to that fight.

But okay.

Water fires.

You bring...

Well, that's not your fault.

You're a new trainer, I assume.

Yeah.

Well, I have no interest in this at all.

Are you kidding me?

It's got so much adventure.

Dash, can I ask a question?

Yes, please.

Is this POGS?

What is POGS?

Ooh, you got over there.

Oh.

It's a thing that I've heard and I've never quite shown.

So, the stackable cardboard disc that you then hit over with the metal disc?

Wait, why were you confused about POGS?

Well, for a second I thought you were talking about a polywog, which is a...

POG...

Polywog.

That would be the clumsy...

That's quite a...

Quite a poor man too.

Yeah, terrible seep.

No, you're talking about stackable cardboard disc that then you use them as a slammer.

With a metal disc.

And then you...

And you make bets and you can win other people's POGs.

Exactly.

A little slammer.

Is it...

You said polywog.

That's what you would call it.

Where I'm from it's called a polywag.

It reminds me of a story I once heard about someone who was in the backseat of a car on a trip with his friends and his friends, a little baby son, who had a polyworl doll.

And he loved this polyworl.

And so this person that I know is pretending to get the name wrong of polyworl several times and a little boy was laughing.

And then all of a sudden the little boy started crying out of frustration because this idiot couldn't understand that the name was polyworl.

And this is a friend of yours.

This is someone I know.

Someone you know.

I can't.

I can't claim friendship was it?

Was it on video or...

No.

I don't...

I guess I don't know this.

This is a story that I heard from us.

A story.

Oh, okay.

I mean I understand that.

I have a...

But to someone I know.

My favorite Pokemon that I use for most battles is called a Charmalian.

If you called him something else I would think that was rude.

So I kind of understand.

That's clearly a portmanteau between charming and a chameleon.

He is char...

He is kind of like a chameleon.

Is his power to be a charm?

Is his battle skill is a charm?

This charms you all out of fighting.

Is it from chameleon and char?

And he's a great barbecue master.

He is a great barbecue master.

He is about a four foot tall fire lizard and I would say his main power is arson.

Oh, well I would just bring a water lizard to that fight.

Yeah, that would be a good man.

Is chameleon air a pocket monster?

Chameleon air the musical artist?

Yes.

I mean he would be if I could ever catch him.

I would catch...

No, see here's the thing.

Well in his power clearly would be just having a lot of money.

You're not supposed to catch humans.

And blending into it.

The technology technically doesn't prevent you from catching anything inside of a ball.

And subjugating them?

You're just talking about slavery.

This does sound very...

Well we're gonna like slavery adjacent.

Okay, well we don't like to use that word when we talk about it.

I bet you don't.

Because he's a Pokemon.

Our companions, not our slaves.

They battle with us sometimes by choice and sometimes begrudgingly.

But we don't ever use the word slavery.

You mean like picking someone up from the airport?

Very much like that.

Like you don't want to but you're not being forced to.

So how many Pokemon do you have?

I have 12.

12, yeah you're not even close to catching them.

No it's gonna be a very long road.

But I'll do it because I believe in myself.

Now you say you train these pocket monsters.

What does the training consist of?

Alright so I take the Pokeball, throw it.

And then they come out and then I shout commands at them and they do what I say.

I see.

This does sound very slavery adjacent.

It's very mean.

It feels.

It's a partnership full of respect and trust.

And what do you do for them?

I put them back in the Pokeball.

Oh my god.

So you're imprisoning them.

Well we win battles together and then sometimes we eat a meal.

But mostly I keep them in the Pokeball because they all eat the same thing and it's a real boring to take them to a restaurant.

So you're only allowing them to eat once and every rare while.

You know the crazy thing Scott?

They don't actually need to eat if they're in the Pokeball.

Okay.

I've got some that have been in that ball for months and if you take them out they're like a little pissed but they're physically fine.

Their favorite meal has to be a Pokeball though right?

Yeah that's right.

Why is that boring?

They love that.

I could eat that like three days a week.

I know I could.

I mean you say that now.

Like a Jeremy Pivvie.

Talk to me on week three.

Does he sing Jeremy Pivvie?

Jeremy Pivvie.

Let me ask you a question.

When the pocketmouches are in this Pokeball are they in a sort of suspended animation?

I wish I could tell you.

I've never been in one in as far as I know no human ever has been.

Oh well that sounds like that's something you should do.

I mean it's so hard to catch them all especially if they keep moving the goal post you should be the first human in a Pokeball.

Oh I should get into one.

Just understand both sides.

I think that's what we're talking about.

Tell you if you want to get into your Pokeball we would let you.

I'll do it.

Dosh grab him well catch himself.

Okay.

What do you need us to?

Oh he did it.

Oh he just did.

Oh he should have.

That is amazing.

Wow he just did it.

Yeah we should have asked that.

We really should have given us instructions.

I don't know how to work this thing.

He said throw it.

Let's take a look at this.

I just he said like throw it I think.

Throw it.

Yeah I'll throw it.

Let's see.

Don't throw that.

Oh careful careful.

Don't throw the smoke bar.

Yeah.

Alright here we go.

I'm free.

Oh wow.

What was that?

What was it like?

What was it like in there?

Okay you know how when you go to sleep and you.

I'm out.

Oh okay.

Yeah try to do something.

But compare it to a movie either.

Ella's gonna have no frame of reference.

Oh okay geez.

How I do this.

Okay you know how well for the rest of you then you know how when you sleep it's like you're kind of aware of existence but it's a little bit different.

Sure sometimes you know you're in a bed.

Oh it's not.

Oh wow.

This is you.

So you can be back in.

I have I have no memory from what just happened.

Oh okay so the last thing you remember is going into the ball.

And then I just I felt a ball I pushed right back.

How long do you think you were gone?

I mean it felt like an instant to me.

Well it feels like only longer than two.

Yeah it's like 120 seconds or so.

I feel like we didn't get a real accurate idea of what it's like to be trapped in the bogey ball.

I'm gonna tell you I do not want to go back in because I feel like I did not exist for that period of time.

Well so now this is what the poke and pockers is how they feel.

Almost definitely.

Yeah.

So does that make you want to release that?

Not even a little.

Oh boy.

I just feel like you really you're really taking advantage of these pocket months.

Oh for sure.

You know how like horses.

He hears it.

You know how horses pull carts.

Yeah are you all up in arms about how horses be pulling stuff around all the time?

I mean sometimes.

Yeah those horses that they want to pull carts around.

I don't like the horses that do just the carriage rides.

They're also fed very well.

Yeah.

They're groomed and they're treated very nice.

Let me ask you questions.

You guys know fit.

I mean we should all be so lucky.

But you know you know fish?

Yeah I know fish.

If you had a fish what would your fishes day to day life be like?

Well that's I mean they swim around in there.

Living their best life.

Swimming the swimming in the water.

My fish has been all over the world.

But they don't know because most of the time they're in a ball.

Yeah.

All in states.

They know that its own existence was going on for most of that time.

But it came out and got to experience parts of all over the world.

I had a fish growing up but it was an outdoor fish so he got to just go wherever.

Yeah mine's an outdoor fish.

So you know I maybe you don't think these pocket monsters have sentience or a soul.

Oh they definitely have both.

Okay well.

Then you truly are a criminal.

You're a slaver.

You're a slave owner.

They're so happy.

How do you know that though?

Well okay well you can tell when a Pokemon is unhappy because it doesn't follow any of your battle commands.

Can one come out?

Can we talk to them?

Yeah but we really need to.

You can't talk to them.

They only say their own name over and over and over again.

Okay so that's getting me tired to know if they're happy.

Is it like I am Groot where it has different intonations?

Yeah yeah.

It's just like that.

So you can translate?

Yeah for sure.

Oh okay.

Let's bring out I guess we bring out a chameleon.

I'll bring out my chameleon.

I sure.

Sorry the chameleon.

Yeah I'll bring out a chameleon.

He's just going to say chameleon a lot.

Okay yeah.

Chameleon I choose you.

Chameleon.

Hey what's up dude?

Chameleon.

Yeah how's it hanging?

Chameleon.

Yeah that's about right.

Chameleon are you?

Are you okay?

Yeah are you?

Charr.

Neil.

I don't think I don't think Chameleon is okay.

Yeah that's intense.

You guys want me to translate or do you just want to infer from that?

Well I know what he's actually saying.

We're all in the room.

We can see what's happening.

Chameleon is crying.

He is crying.

He is crying but not for the reasons you think.

Okay what translate for us.

Okay so Chameleon this one specifically is an arson type Pokemon.

Chameleon.

He's mad because he hasn't burned down a building lately.

Chameleon.

Yeah so Chameleon.

Yeah he's shaking that up and down.

Chameleon.

Up and down if you're tilted sideways.

Sure.

Well yeah that's Chameleon.

Okay so you know how like in India yes and no doesn't look like the same head jester as it does for in America.

I don't I did not know that.

That's true.

I did not know that.

First place is India.

I know in the movie Gladiator they do thumbs up when it should have been thumbs down.

I don't know about that but that's probably right.

Chameleon.

Yeah gotcha.

I love some medical track.

Okay Chameleon.

Chameleon.

What is one thing that I could do to make your life a little bit better?

Chameleon.

A little bank.

Chameleon.

You can't burn down a bank.

Chameleon.

That felt to me like kill me.

Chameleon.

It seems to be.

Yes.

Chameleon.

Chameleon return.

Oh wow.

Okay I don't feel like you were giving us the proper translation.

I do feel yeah I feel like we learned more about the real situation with these Pokemon than then you wanted to let on.

Number four.

Oh so good.

So nice.

That one was let's listen to it twice.

That was a treat.

Well let's hear it one more time.

All right.

I'm going to do that.

You tricked me.

It's like a thirty minute clip.

Yes.

You're like the trickster low key.

And now you must reside within this dimension.

That was fun.

You were saying that was a fun episode to do.

It was fun.

It was it was an interesting combination of people.

And the park ranger stuff.

Zach and Jess obviously work together a lot.

They have a podcast every week and they're writing partners and yeah.

Yeah.

So but they were doing they were not connected and so yeah it was you know you put these shows together you book them and you go like all right I got this person I got this person.

Now it's God's hand who knows how they're going to be together but that was a really fun one to do.

It was.

Weren't it?

It was.

It weren't it weren't it were fun.

Weren't it fun.

It was fun.

It was.

It was stranger.

It was fun.

And as I looked out across that golden valley I knew that I understood more of man and God than I had previously known that guy who does who am I doing when I do the he strange.

I think that is Pat but trim.

Pat but trim like Mr. Hayney on Greena.

How did he chance about that?

How did he figure out because a lot of it seems like a lot of comedians in the 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond.

They're comedians.

The office can agree on.

They found they found a funny way to talk and then they did that their entire careers.

Yeah.

And that was enough for people.

I feel like it's rooted in vaudeville, right?

Right.

But so how does he is he just like going fuck I don't have a funny way to talk.

I need to have a career.

I mean this shit isn't funny.

I guess I'm going to do a weird voice.

I mean that because nowadays when you're doing a cowboy voice or whatever sometimes people will bust out a Mr. Hayney or a tribute to Mr. Hayney.

I think in the first record Ralph doesn't, oh God what's his name?

He was on Ben going.

He's great.

He was in firefly.

Me?

Oh.

But he does basically the great Gilder sleeve that guy.

Yeah.

He basically like people sometimes do impressions of these don't worry, Mrs. Ricardo.

I will get the bill.

He's on firefly?

Yeah, you know who I'm talking about.

Alan Tudic?

Yeah, Alan Tudic.

He's right.

So in record Ralph, I think in the first record Ralph he's the villain in it and he basically is doing that guy I think.

Yeah.

So everyone's you know it's like everyone came up with every funny voice there is and that's a lot like listening to comedy bang bang bang bang bang.

I'm at all 10.

Yeah.

It's like we've done every funny voice there is.

But how did he how was he experimenting just going like well what if I like slipped in between falsetto and my chest voice?

Yes.

Like if I was going through puberty.

All the time they're strange and that fits for a cowboy voice.

Yeah.

Well hello there stranger because do welcome to welcome to the mountain in town.

Do it in like a regular voice like take away the cowboy affect.

Okay.

Hello stranger.

Welcome to the mining town.

Is that what you mean?

Yeah, not good.

That's what you didn't have an accent you're like hello stranger.

Welcome to the mining town.

Oh yeah.

Yeah.

That's not that's weird.

Something wrong with that guy.

But you have this other accent like oh that guy just talked that way.

Oh, stranger.

Something about the different vowel choices and the hitting the ours really hard home.

This just works.

Exactly.

Or is it that it's bit he's done it in so many things he didn't in so many Disney films and you know in green acres like you said he's just done it so many times it sounds wrong if you have any variation.

But it sounded just as wrong when he started.

I mean maybe he's fucking drunk.

Yeah he's probably a drunk.

You know they all were back then.

Everyone got that all were.

Was it great you could be in show business and be drunk all the time.

Yeah, all the time.

And now it's just like on these end of the year episodes are the only times that we get drunk.

Exactly.

Got that.

Every classic film you've ever seen people are shit faced.

Shit faced.

Okay.

If you watch any movie and it and I'm talking about okay so the movies up to 77 everyone's drew every single person.

So that includes jobs.

But also every star wars I think was the first movie where the entire cast wasn't drunk.

They were all sober too.

They're all they're all in sober.

They're all super sober.

They're all they all live together and sober living.

Yeah.

They were each other sober companions.

They all get a seat or cushion goes there.

Go grandma target himself.

Kenny Baker.

And then post 77 is when everyone started eating claim jumper and getting really fat.

Yeah.

And then when everyone got so fat in the movies there was a good like like 82 to 84.

Everyone was so fat.

Yeah.

And then Jane Fon to start working out.

Everyone got skinny.

Yeah.

But now anytime you see a movie every single person has their hair dyed really dark.

Yeah.

And everyone is terrified they're going to get fired.

Yeah.

That's any any ever watch.

That's it.

That's show business.

Everyone has their hair dyed really dark and they're afraid they're going to get fired.

That's any any scene you see in anything pick out pick out anything and I can tell you I'll point it out and go that person.

Hair is really dark.

A fist going to get fired.

They're going to get fired.

Yeah.

Go read the intern with Robert De Niro.

Sure.

If you want to have fun every it's it's evenly divided half of the cast hair.

They're really dark.

Yeah.

They're having a guy.

They're going to get fired.

Yeah.

That is true.

That is show business.

If you're old enough to dye your hair you're not here.

You're old.

If there's grass on the field play ball.

And on that note we're going to end this episode unfortunate.

Say something else as for a pallet.

Anyway, Coney 2012.

Okay.

All right.

We have to end this episode.

We're getting down to it though because on our next episode we are going to count down the number three episode the number two episode and the number one episode of 2018.

What if we didn't?

You're right.

Let's just throw it.

I'm just I'm just we don't have to decide right now.

Okay.

Well, tell you what check back in with us on Thursday.

Yeah.

If we do it we'll meet back together here on Thursday.

Sure.

If we do it great to do the episode live as we always do.

Of course.

If we're not here we just decide.

We didn't do it.

Yeah.

And we and there's don't worry.

There's no emergency neither of us have slipped and fallen and cracked our pretty little heads.

But check to see if we have died our hair really dark.

That's true.

I'm guys we gotta go but we will see you back here on Thursday or not.

Who knows?

Um, love it.

I'll see you soon.

Love it.

See you soon.

That's not a thing I say at the end.

It is now.

I love it.

See you soon.

Bye.

See you soon.

Bye.

See you soon.

I'm going to go ahead and take a look at the next slide.
