Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Thank you to Colfax-McLiverneck for that catchphrase submission.

Thank you Colfax, and welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another edition, end of September edition.

And yeah, very special.

We only get to celebrate the end of September once a year, and here we are.

Episode 777, triple sevens!

Boy, this were Vegas.

We would be raking in the coins.

Unfortunately, it is not Vegas.

It is a podcast.

My name is Scott Ockermann, I am the host of Comedy Bang Bang, and we have an exceptional show.

Coming up a little later, we have a postal worker and a small business owner.

So that's pretty good, but hey, the headline is...

♪ Celebbs are back, baby ♪ ♪ Celebbs are back! They've come back to the studio! ♪ Look at the celebs we've had this month.

Adam Scott, John Hamm, Jason Manzukas.

Okay, yeah, they're all friends of mine.

They're doing me a favor.

But still, they're all here!

Celebbs are back!

And this episode is no exception.

We have an incredible celebrity here right in front of me.

I believe Emmy nominee, if not winner.

Winner!

Winner winner Emmy winner!

Emmy dinner?

I don't know.

Yeah, I don't serve dinner.

They don't serve dinner at the Emmys.

They do afterwards.

You have to buy your own snacks.

At the Emmys?

Yeah, you have to buy your snacks at the concessions.

They have things you'd buy at sports.

They have pretzels because this is at the Nokia.

Is that correct?

Yeah, the Microsoft.

Oh, the Microsoft.

Pretzels, popcorn.

And that's it.

And they don't allow you to take it into the theater, as I recall.

They were like, no, sit there in the...

Indeed, it outside.

Yeah, now it's happening from five to eight.

But then, then did you go...

Then there's a governor's ball, yeah.

Yeah, the governor's ball.

So we went this year.

Congratulations, by the way.

Thank you.

And I'll introduce you in a second.

Oh, yeah.

You should do that first.

Hey, now you're telling me what to do.

It was only your second time on the show.

We went this year and the ceremony was inside, but then the...

Wait, did you go because the Chip-n-Dale is one?

My husband wrote Chip-n-Dale Rescue Rangers.

All right.

And so this was the...

It's not the night proper, but they do all of the stuff that they normally do on the actual time.

So it's almost like they're doing a rehearsal for the dinner.

It's called the creative arts Emmys.

So it's basically the same Emmys, except it's...

...televised on FXX later.

They cut out a lot of the stuff.

They had no red carpet this year.

No red carpet this year.

No red carpet.

This year I'm so sorry.

It's okay.

I mean, it just shows how much Hollywood values people who aren't really in front of the camera.

Yeah, because they had the red carpet for the regular ones.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Rachel Bloom is here.

Yes, they do.

They have the red carpet.

But there was Nariya Keenan Thompson.

No, Keenan was nowhere to be found.

Nariya.

Probably rehearsing.

That dance number.

Yep.

Sure was.

Uh-huh.

Anyway.

So you were there.

Congratulations.

You're an Emmy winner for...

For songwriting.

So I got my I meet the creative arts.

Yeah, as did I.

Yeah.

Congratulations.

Are you just one?

You got one.

Who is counting these types of things?

I very clearly you.

Yes.

And I did present at the creative arts.

I presented at Creative Arts this year.

Yes.

And I hosted the local Emmys.

That's exciting.

Which was a weird thing to do.

Your shoes are...

Are funny.

They are very funny, but your husband now is...

So you're an Emmy couple.

We are an Emmy couple.

It's very, very hot.

Do you make them kiss each other?

I mean, here's the fuck up.

Do you make your Emmys do exactly whatever you do in bed?

To each other?

Yes.

Is that a fun thing?

Well, so they just sleep.

Right.

Yes.

Okay.

Put on sleep masks.

They just...

The noise machines.

Yeah, exactly.

And then one of the Emmys goes, should we...

And then the other ones...

This is like, okay, never mind.

And then on their phone.

For another hour.

Scrolling.

Sexting.

Oh, good.

Nian, I wish that...

I wish that I was in bed next to you right now.

The things I do to you.

If you were awake.

What song did you win for?

A song called a very subtly titled song called, Antidepressants are so not a big deal.

That's right.

Yes.

I remember this.

Very subtle.

And who did you write it with?

Whom did you write it with?

Oh, with...

With Whom did you write it?

With Whom did you write this song?

I wrote it with Jack Dolgin, my longtime songwriting partner.

And...

Rhymes with bulge.

That's how you remember it.

Yeah, that's an easy way to remember it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Super easy.

Bulging with Emmys.

Like, Jackets full of Emmys.

Bulging.

Oh, and Dolgin.

Got it.

Yeah, it was weird.

He used to say like Jackets full of Emmys.

And until he won an Emmy, it seemed very weird.

Yeah, because it was a very strange thing to say.

But he was prescient regarding that.

He was.

Yes.

And then our...

The other winner was the late Adam Schlesinger.

Yes, that's right.

Wonderful songwriter and composer of...

I just saw his musical on...

In New York.

Bedwetter.

Bedwetter, yeah.

Which is really good.

Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

Yep.

Great talent.

We were just talking about that before.

It's hard to segue into on a comedy podcast.

It's quite sad.

Yep.

We did it.

Hey, you gotta embrace both the sad and the happy I found.

Nothing in between.

This is...

What I said makes sense.

It actually does.

I think I live my life.

Hold on.

Spam risk is calling me.

Oh, this is exciting.

Hello.

This is a confirmation call from Amazon.

Oh, my God.

It's the Amazon's calling me.

Oh, my God.

They bought your movie.

A couple of AirPods total amount of money.

You bought my movie based on Apple AirPods?

Oh, my God.

Such a weird product for...

A project rather, for Amazon.

It is in your account while processing the payment.

Oh, my God.

She's processing the first payment already.

Oh, Spam, I love you, baby.

Thank you so much.

Well, this is wonderful.

You're here to talk, though, not about the past.

You're here to talk about, well, the present and perhaps the future.

Because you have two projects out right now.

Yeah, that was so well said, by the way.

Thank you so much.

I really appreciate that.

And speaking of well said, there's so many well said things in this first project we're going to talk about.

Kiss and tell.

Now, we're not going to kiss, but why don't you tell me about this project?

Oh, thank you, you naughty boy.

We could kiss, but...

We could, I guess.

Sure.

Mm-hmm.

Oh, okay, great.

All right.

So, now that that's out of the way, tell us about this.

This is an audiobook from...

It's an audiobook.

Both Simon and Schuster?

I mean, the thing is, there's been a rift between them for years, but they reconnected...

They did each other.

For this.

It's like a Katy Perry Taylor Swift situation.

Oh my God.

So, it basically was a comedy show that has been turned into an audiobook that I hosted with J. Farrow.

And I'm taking credit for it, but like, it was one night of my life.

Right.

I spent just an epic night hosting these two comedy shows.

We only have so many nights in our life.

So, I mean, for you to say, it's just one.

I mean, it's a very special night from a very special life.

That's very true.

Oh.

Yes.

That's very true.

The night of your life is equal to 100 nights from somebody who lives in wherever the fuck Ohio.

I was going to say like one night of my life also in like, yeah, yeah, because they're doing bullshit.

Yeah.

Anyway, one night.

So, it was a live comedy show with the likes of like, Alyssa Limpares, others.

We got the...

Because I'm looking at the credits here too.

Cars.

We're there.

We're on.

It was so many.

It's Suco?

Yes.

She was there.

Talking great.

She was there with her husband.

Oh, cool.

It's great.

So, it's a night about...

I get the picture.

She's off the market.

Yes.

So, it's a night about like dating and relationships and basically the stories start at dating and then they end at like marriage and relationships.

So, it's comedians being vulnerable and talking about their romantic relationships.

And where was this recorded?

We recorded it at the Westside Comedy Theater in Santa Monica.

In Santa...

Not a lot of comedy heavens in Santa Monica.

Oh, no.

I don't go to Santa Monica.

No.

When I first started, there was a place called The Upfront that we used to do shows there.

But it was always such a jaunt.

Westside is a pretty fun theater.

It's kind of located in the promenade.

Oh.

But I've always had really good shows there.

The vibe in that room is really good.

Okay.

And then did these comedians know they were being recorded or was there a lawsuit after the fact?

And they settled that and then turned this into an audiobook.

No, well, so actually they weren't even there.

We placed microphones in their bathrooms.

Oh, okay.

In their bathrooms in their bedrooms and we recorded over a series of two years.

And they were just telling secrets to each other.

And they were just telling secrets and then we said, look, you'll get a $300 honorarium if we can use this.

And they were like, well, well, I need to keep exposure.

Honorarium, by the way, when you get one of those...

What the fuck does that mean?

Honorarium.

They try to give it.

In honor of giving you no money.

Yeah, here's $300.

Just give it to just just just burn it.

Yeah, just burn $300 in front of me.

You're not even going to call it paycheck.

Exactly.

Yeah, burn it in front of me.

Burn it in front of me and make me watch and make me thank you.

So this is produced, obviously, by...

That's one of the most privileged things we could ever say.

If you're going to give me $300, burn it.

Just burn it instead.

Because I'll just go...

That's crazy.

I'll do a guest writing stint at SNL instead.

If I really want money, anyway.

I'll just consult on a sitcom.

In any case, this is obviously produced by Kevin Hart's heartbeat.

Oh, yes, it is.

Obviously.

Now, and then I heard that fact before, you know, this even was set up.

I heard like, oh, by the way, there's a new audio book coming out.

It's produced by Kevin Hart's heartbeat.

Yes.

And I assumed it was H-E-A-R-T-B-E-A-T.

The way you would always spell heartbeat.

But it's not because his name is a synonym.

A no-no, homophone.

Homophone.

Yes, to the word heart.

As we all know, is the muscle that pumps blood.

Yes, it has four chambers.

You know what we're talking about here.

I'm aware.

Of course.

So this is obviously a dynamite company that's in there produced.

I was really excited.

And in fact, I went to...

Do you remember the Netflix as a joke comedy festival a couple months ago?

Yes, I do.

The one that was scheduled for 2020.

Yep.

I went, there was like a big heartbeat reception to celebrate Netflix as a joke.

And I was like, you know what?

Like I've been inside for this pandemic.

I'm going to go to this like big party and I'm going to meet Kevin Hart.

And so I get on this boss.

It's like a crowded boss and we're like, oh, there's a surge right now.

It's fine.

And because it's an outdoor party, even though it's super crowded and we're there.

And I stand to try to shake hands with Kevin Hart.

I mean, not available.

So I don't meet Kevin Hart and my husband and I got COVID.

Oh, so no one's going to get COVID if they listen to this, right?

I mean, look, the doctors don't know anything apparently.

Yeah, could be.

So someone had COVID at some point before or after they were recording this, hopefully not during.

Yeah.

Then they might transmit it to the listener.

I don't know.

We don't know.

Fauci won't tell us.

Fauci's having to pass over Seder with his globalist friends.

He's too busy.

He's too busy to tell us how the pandemic works.

He's too busy eating matzah.

No, Rachel.

When you hear the globalist, it's just juice.

That's a good one.

Yes.

Anytime it's the globalist, the elite, they're talking about juice.

Yes, of course.

If they only knew how not elite most Jews are.

Now, Rachel, I was thinking about this.

I was thinking about how I felt about this project of yours, this audiobook.

And I was like, it feels like to me that each performance features personal stories and shared memories from their own romantic journeys and they bring the universal challenges and rewards of romantic relationships to life.

I mean, that was my interpretation of what I thought this was.

I haven't listened to it.

What I thought it was about, but I don't know.

I was really wondering how you felt about this.

I think that your interpretation is honestly really apt.

I think the only thing that you missed is between the lines you can get it on Audible, Google Play or wherever you shop for audiobooks.

Oh.

But that's like a deep.

That's like a deep, deep, like Shekovian subtext.

And I mean, I think like something else that a lot of people never understand about Kiss and Tell is that you'll see these recognizable milestones, crushes, crushed, proms attended and Virginity's lost couples, counseling, parenthood and blending families.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

I didn't get that from just the description that I read.

A lot of people don't get it.

Yeah.

When you first.

Even after you listen to it.

Even after you listen to it, you have to listen to it multiple times again on Audible, Google Play or wherever you shop for audiobooks.

I shop for my audiobooks at Barnes and Noble and I get them in CD form.

I go to Gelsons for mine.

Wow.

It's right there next to the roast chickens.

Well, this is incredible.

This kiss and tell.

It's really good.

Honestly, we're doing a bit about promotion, blah, blah, blah, but it's really good.

It's going to be really good.

And it's out now and people can listen to it and should listen to it and might listen to it and won't listen to it.

No, and will listen to it is what I meant to say.

I mean, we got Chris Garcia.

We got Daniel Perez.

You're not skipping over James the third.

Are you or is that James ill?

That's the thing is I didn't know how to read that.

Yeah, I don't know.

So I didn't want to fuck that up.

I know.

Sorry to lamp shade it.

Is that something?

No, but it should be.

Yeah.

Sorry to lamp shade that.

But this is incredible.

And I say we discuss it no further.

What do you say?

And let's move on to the second thing you're here to do.

Now the second thing you have is this show reboot.

Yeah, that at the time of this release.

Have they pronounced it in Canada?

Is it rebound here or?

It would actually in Canada, it's it's reboot because there's a there's an obscure animated Canadian show from the like early 90s called reboot.

Oh, they say reboot.

What is I've seen commercials for this?

I think and it isn't Keegan Michael Key in it.

Keegan, it's Judy Greer, Johnny Knoxville, Paul Reiser, Krista Marieu, Kayla Murthy, myself, a whole host of guest stars.

And it's a show about fictitious 90s sitcom that.

Every show is fictitious.

So it's like, you know what I mean?

So it's kind of like when you go, it's about something fictitious.

I'm like, yeah, that's everything.

Well, it's unless it's like, you know, the, what was that one?

Well, I would say it's a show about a.

I'm not saying it's a fictitious show.

I'm saying it's a show about a fictitious 90s sitcom.

Right.

But everything, every show is about a fictitious thing, right?

Like Ozark is about a fictitious family.

Yeah, I guess, I guess you could say, I love Lucy is a is a fictitious show about a band leader and his annoying wife.

Although he's a real band leader.

So that's where you'd be an analogy.

And she's also annoying.

Yeah.

So this is, I don't know.

This is where I'm starting to doubt.

Also, you start getting into like, I mean, my favorite thing is what?

What TV shows take place in the same universe as each other?

That's right.

Yeah, because you have the Munchiverse, obviously.

Yes.

Oh, wait, which is the one that the theory of all the shows that take place in the snow globe of the kid at the end of saying elsewhere?

Oh, I don't know this.

There's a whole theory, and I forget his name, but for those of you who don't know, there was a hospital, I guess, this is a, this is a heavy spoilers for the end of saying elsewhere, by the way, spoiler, if anyone's huge, probably the biggest saying elsewhere spoiler you could give.

But also, is it?

Because like it, okay.

It's not going to spoil the plot to anyone other than the fact that all these people that you've known and loved aren't real.

Aren't real, but I mean, that's every show is our point.

So one of the kids, one of the characters is known to, I think, have in the show a developmentally disabled kid.

Yes.

And he's a doctor in this hospital.

The guy is a doctor's hospital.

But then suddenly it's like snowing.

This is this is deep, deep spoilers for the final episode.

It's snowing.

There's a blizzard.

There's snow and then suddenly it pulls out of this kid shaking this snow globe and there's all the snow in it.

And it is this development.

I can't even say it.

That's how sacred it is.

Developmentally disabled child who has the same father, but the father is not a doctor.

No.

It's just some schlub.

And it's just a snow globe of a hospital, which by the way, like bad snow globe.

That's a terrible Christmas.

Who gives a kid a snow globe?

Who gives a developmentally disabled child?

Like that's something you got for free.

Yeah.

While you were there at the hospital.

Appreciate this terrible snow globe.

Right.

Oh, my friends like developmentally disabled kid.

Right.

Yeah.

Which is a really mean thing to get.

But then of course he does.

He actually loves it.

He loves it.

And he's there and he's been imagining this entire.

He's been imagining like what if my doctor or what if my dad wasn't some dumb idiot.

He was a doctor and he saved a bunch of lives and you know, and it's just like so moving because it's like, oh yeah, wow.

Hopefully all of our children hope that we're not dumb idiots that we're like better than what we could be is the lesson that I took from it.

Oh, that's interesting.

I never thought about thematically what it means.

What I've thought about is there's there are a bunch of theories online of what other TV shows take place in this case.

Anything that's ever snowed.

Oh, that's interesting.

Oh, that's so okay.

Is it anything in a hospital?

Okay.

Anything that's ever seen.

Like E slash R you remember that show from the 90s?

Oh, oh yeah.

E slash R.

When there would be a bomb threat every season.

Sure.

Yeah.

Every season.

A lot of stabbing.

Someone wanted to bomb the hospital stab the hospital.

I understand that people die in hospitals.

Happens every day I would imagine.

But the doctors.

That's where they are there and affix the people.

I really like this review show of shows that premiered 30 years ago that you're just now getting around to.

We're on show where we just know I we watched him back then, but we're just getting right to talking about them.

So Mary Richards.

She's an up and come right.

But in any single is she fucking what's going on.

Here's my point though.

It can't be E slash R because that's a different hospital and the kid doesn't have a snow globe about him or do you or is the theory that there there are a bunch.

It's like a certain store that sells only hospital themed snow globes.

Wait.

Okay.

You're just hitting on like Pixar movie theory.

You know, the universal Pixar movie theory.

Call your husband.

He's got animated experience.

No, no, no.

And I did Shark Tail.

We can team up on this.

What I'm saying is like, you know how there's the theory of all the Pixar movies take place for the same work?

Yeah.

All right.

You're hitting on a really crazy thing, which is let's zoom out from this snow globe.

Is there a gift shop that only sells different.

It's different themed hospital or that only sells snow globes that are meant to start a TV shows in kids heads.

Yes.

So like like NCIS.

Okay.

What do you got?

Okay.

You've come up with it.

It was okay.

It was kind of inspired by Hill Street blues like because it was the same network.

Right.

Okay.

So you'll see a lead just in Boston's self end.

Okay.

So first of all, I'm going to say, Ally McPiel is in this guy's head.

What's the other perfectly legal?

No, what it was.

Boston legal.

Yeah.

Right.

Perfectly legal is perhaps a different magazine that I've been perusing.

Sounds like a video you watched last night.

Is that in this universe?

It was snowing something.

So all the Boston shows.

Perfectly legal.

I like that because either the person in the video is completely not legal or it's like it's a website that's like aimed for very like legally like if it's like do you do you someday want to be a politician or are you a lawyer?

Right.

This is a porn website where we promise everything you watch is perfectly legal.

These are all consenting.

Also, it could be about like people who are over 40 and it's like look, there's no gray area here.

You know?

So what other show?

I mean, what other shows do they think are in there?

Just Boston show.

Less than statutory.

Well, look the other way on this one.

So private practice.

Yep.

Boston public.

Mm hmm.

I'm trying to think of any other Boston show.

Boston.

I'm in a show that's shooting in Boston right now.

Really?

Is it Boston or just shooting?

It is.

It's the I'm on Julia, which is the show about Julia Child on HBO.

Oh, yes.

Yes.

I'm in the middle of filming it.

Season one just came out.

Yeah.

So I'm on season.

So she goes to Boston?

She it's all in Boston.

Julia Child started the Julia Child show started as a local a Boston public TV.

Public access show.

A public access show in Boston.

And then it got syndicated like nationwide.

Incredible story.

So it takes place in the early 60s.

The tomato.

I don't know what kind of parts there are.

Yeah, David I appears as an it's a place.

He plays a celery.

He plays Fettuccine.

Um, BB New Earth is a carrot.

Um, especially with the child.

He knew it.

Yeah.

No, 100% really.

They're whatever their names were on that show.

Yeah, and they keep it in the show.

It's so weird.

Do they also keep?

Here's what I hate when a show keeps in the director going caught after every scene.

That's so in now, right?

It's so weird that all shows have started doing this.

It's just like all over severance.

It's like, and I'm like, get it.

It's a hit.

And I got the Ben Sillers directing and you want to keep his lines in there.

But it's like, come on.

Well, here's the thing is they need to let you know it's a fictitious show.

Yes.

If we don't hear cut or see action, we're like, this is actually happening in front of me and I got to get involved.

People thought that Gilligan's Island was real.

What?

People like the train coming at the audience?

Or the what?

Oh, you know, the old movie, my favorite movie where the train comes at the audience and everyone.

Oh, yes.

Yes.

Did you see the new down to now?

They try to recreate it.

Did they succeed?

They tried.

At the end of it, they were like, look, we didn't do it.

Sorry.

We'll give you your money back.

Just ask for it.

Well, in any case, oh, yeah.

Gilligan's Island is real.

The network would get letters from people being like, why are you keeping these people on the silent for this TV show?

Let them let them go.

And this is where people are people?

People are fucking idiots.

People are so fucking stupid.

Yeah.

People before now, before the internet, like the internet's not great, but people used to be so fucking stupid.

Yeah.

Now we're, thank God the internet is here because they can look up and go like, oh, is Gilligan's Island real?

And then, you know, just like that, they're in QAnon.

Yes.

Yeah.

That's how quick it goes.

Yeah, but at least like, there's a community for them.

Yeah, that's true.

And it's about the friends they made along the way.

That's exactly.

Did you watch into the storm, the QAnon documentary on the TV?

I lived it, baby.

Oh, no.

That was you at the antlers.

Yep.

Don't know what you're very doing.

Yes.

It was me with the antlers.

Okay.

So reboot, though, is about a, it's, it's, here's what I'm guessing from what I've seen.

Oh, yeah.

Guess it.

It's about, it's about, okay.

So in this universe, which is not our universe, because obviously, Keegan Michael Key is in our universe and he's a beloved hilarious community.

Well, this is an interesting debate because TV shows have done this before where like, the series finale of the nanny, Fran Fine meets Fran Drescher.

Really?

So it's like, there's this moment, it's crazy, where Fran Fine's like, I'm a fan.

And Fran Drescher's like, oh, you look like me.

From what?

I don't have a show.

No.

She has a show called the nanny in the nanny verse.

Yes, because she talks to Fran Fine and she goes, I'm going to use that on my show, the nanny.

Okay.

So that's crazy.

They did a morken Mindy where they call out that morck looks exactly like Robin Williams.

Like Robin Williams?

Yes.

Okay.

And also in this world, in the world of morken Mindy, Robin Williams is like a sex symbol because the joke is that Robin Williams runs in the house with his clothes torn apart because women are like, rabid, rabidly trying to get him naked.

So this is a third universe.

Yes.

Okay.

So this is a universe that has a Robin Williams in it.

But he's not on a show called morken Mindy.

And he's a sex symbol.

And he's like a super sex.

Super sex symbol.

Yeah.

Okay.

So that's okay.

It's a place where super hairy men are like prized above all others.

Right.

Exactly.

So like that's the question of in reboot.

Is there also, is there someone named Keegan Michael Key who just looks a lot like like Michael's.

Like this guy.

So is there dialogue in every episode where Keegan's character walks in and goes hot just to manage expectations.

I'm not Keegan Michael Key.

And everyone goes, Oh, okay.

You just look a lot like him.

Okay.

And you're a famous actor just like him.

How crazy.

And he goes, well, no, I'm not as famous.

And then Judy Grewrocks in she goes, Hey, hey, I'm not, I'm not Judy Greer.

I'm, I think her name is Bremery Larson.

I'm Bremery Larson.

I look a lot like Judy Greer.

So that's usually the first.

And then do your character walking and going like, look, I am not Rachel Bloom.

Well, she doesn't because no one really knows who Rachel Bloom is in that universe or this one.

Okay.

So that's like, so that's like, so honestly, you can skip the first 15 minutes of every episode.

But usually they have the first 15 minutes of every episode are the actors clarifying that they just look like other famous actors.

Yeah.

Okay, good.

So that's like, so that's already this is a great show.

So honestly, you can skip the first 15 minutes of every episode because it's just that.

Right.

And then other than that, that's about it.

No, this is about a a in this universe.

Yeah.

There is a, there is a show approximately how many years ago or even decades ago, it's like, it's supposed to be like 2000, 2000s.

Okay.

So post full house pre nine 11.

Well, I, I'm actually in the math.

So it's because one of the characters is supposed to be like mid twenties.

Okay.

It was a kid.

So it's about 16 years or so ago.

So maybe 2006.

So it was post 9 11.

Okay.

So yeah, we're in the shadow of 9 11 and there's they come out with a TV show.

Opening of the show is the second plane hitting the south.

Oh, interesting.

Sounds like a strange show, but I'm into it.

I like it.

And so there was this television show back in 2006, it sounds like that was a, was it a sitcom or a drama?

It's like a cheesy sitcom, cheesy sitcom.

Yeah.

And they are now rebooting it here in 2022 and the cast members.

It's like, it's basically Roseanne.

Is that what we're doing?

Steve Levitan who created has said it was kind of in some manner.

Who cast me on just shoot me.

Yes, the casting directors were a big part of it, but he had the final say.

That's so cool.

You can see it on YouTube right now.

My two scenes in any case.

Yes.

So he, he was, he worked on just shoot me then modern family.

Yeah.

And so you cast on modern family.

I was not.

Did you ever audition?

No, I'm offer only by that.

Oh, oh.

Meaning I do not work.

Okay.

So, you surprised at the actors who just coming from also casting the actors who are offer only that are like really?

Wait, you're coming from casting.

What do you mean?

Well, no, I don't come from casting, but sometimes when I'm producing, I get access to the casting sheet.

Yes, yes, yes.

I've done that myself where it's like, yes, really.

They're them?

Them?

Offer only.

They don't want to read.

They can't read.

Oh no.

That's what it usually is.

Exactly.

It's our school system.

Teachers are basically bad at their jobs.

Yes.

So I always get back to every.

We should take their money.

For, for a, for an actor that says offer only, I always get back and I say, I'm, I'm so sorry that the system failed your client.

They are obviously unable to read.

I wish Jennifer Lawrence well.

Wouldn't it be better if teachers gave a money back guarantee?

Like you're going to learn everything or your money back.

Yes.

You just have a lot of money.

Yeah.

To give their salaries basically.

Just divvy it up between all their students at the end of the year.

Yeah.

The parts of their salary that they're not using to buy school supplies.

That's right.

So now, this show, there was a show and now it's a show.

Yeah.

Great.

Reboot.

Hulu.

Yeah.

This is good.

Yeah.

This is, I mean, this is great.

It's great.

I think it's a great show.

It's a great show.

So Steve Levitan did it and, and did, oh, what a cast?

One episode a week or are we.

They're going to release three.

Well, by the time this airs, there will be episodes.

Yes, three will have come out.

And there's, there's like a twist with my character that I have been embargoed from talking about.

Okay.

But these episodes will have come out, but I just, you want people to watch it.

Yeah.

You want me to watch it.

Yeah.

Okay.

So something happens with your character.

I'm guessing.

I'm just going to say it.

I'm guessing like a Ned Stark kind of lizard arm comes out of my pussy.

Oh, shit.

Why did they embargo that?

That makes me want to watch it.

There, I don't know.

Sue me Levitan.

Okay.

It starts as a show about a rebooted sitcom, but really it's about a writer with a, with a, about a writer with a, with a lizard lizard arm and her pussy.

Like a, like giant lizard or just regular lizard arm?

No.

This is important.

Yeah.

So it's a great question.

It's just an arm.

Just an arm.

Sure.

But it's an arm of like a, like a, like a Hila monster.

Oh.

Big lizard arm.

So one of those ones you'd see down in Mexico or something like that.

Oh, okay.

So it comes out squishes out.

Does it do it?

Does it perform tasks?

Well, it always can be.

It always, it always says, are you Keegan Michael Kee?

Good.

It talks.

Like, does it have to make the little hand mouth sign, kind of?

No, there's just like a disembodied voice.

And I mean, this is also super embargoed, but it is, it's James Earl Jones.

Whoa, Darth Vader himself.

Yes.

From field of dreams.

Yes.

Um, and a third thing.

I'm going to get so dinged for this.

I, I, I'm sharing all the twists.

That's okay.

It's come out by now by the time we're doing this.

Yeah, exactly.

So if you want to see this, uh, Gila monster arm coming out of a, a woman's vagina.

Yeah.

And is it just, is it graphic?

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Good.

Yeah.

Great.

So then watch reboot.

Yeah.

Um, three episodes out right now and more to come.

Uh, I would think, although did, did they just ended after that thing comes out or are they just like, look, this is, this is the high point.

Well, then the lizard arm takes out a snow globe.

Oh, okay.

So you're in the first.

I love it.

Well, look, we have to take a break, but these are two great projects, uh, both reboot and kiss and tell.

Uh, we're going to take a break.

When we come back, we have a postal worker and a small business owner.

Rachel, can you stick around and talk to these people?

Yeah.

I'd love to.

This, I mean, this is a big, big show.

Yeah.

celebs are back end of September edition.

77, seven baby, we will be right back with more comedy, baby.

After this, comedy, bang, bang, we're back.

Rachel Bloom is here.

Of course, kiss and tell out, uh, wherever you get your audio books, but of course on audible Google play, uh, et cetera.

And then, uh, reboot also is out and three episodes of that are out right now.

And, uh, this is a big week for you.

Yeah, but you seem depressed about it.

What's wrong, Rachel?

Um, I miss the lizard arm.

You want it back?

Miss it?

You missed having it up there?

Yeah.

Maybe feel warm, cozy.

Oh, I'm sorry.

You could, I mean, props could probably, if you make a call, maybe they haven't destroyed it by now, right?

Or are they keeping it for season two?

Oh, we're keeping it for season two and now they're going to sell it on eBay.

Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

We'll cheer up.

We have more show here.

Oh, great.

Oh, you're excited by that.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

Great.

I am a sociopath.

Oh, I forgot that about you.

I had people like you.

Oh, I understand.

Well, you don't understand human emotions.

No.

Okay.

I'm just mirroring you.

Oh, okay.

You are.

Oh, okay.

I love my wife.

Cool up.

Thank you so much.

Well, that's so nice to hear.

Well, speaking of people we love, let's get to our next guest and we're going to love them, even though I've never met him before, but nor have you, right?

So this is, although that wouldn't that be weird if you had met our next guest before?

I'm assuming I've never met them before.

They've never been on the show before, but let's get to him.

He's a postal worker.

Please welcome to the show Chris Orchard.

Scotty.

Hey, good to see you man.

Bring it in.

No.

What do you mean?

Ow, what'd you just do to me?

I do hugs.

You just make.

I do hugs, man.

You hug?

I don't hug people.

Hello.

I don't hug people.

I just met.

I'm sorry.

I thought we'd talk before.

I bring by your mail.

I brought by your mail before we've had a few.

Oh, you're my postal worker?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

When you say before, daily?

Or did you just have done it every once in a while?

This is Rachel Bloom, by the way.

Oh, hi Rachel Bloom.

Nice to meet you.

Hi.

Chris Orchard.

Oh, nice to meet you.

Do you prefer Chris or Mr. Orchard?

Oh, Chris is fine.

Chris is fine.

You can't, by the way, we can't set precedent that we're going to start calling guests, Mr.

whatever their name is.

The postal workers have an official doctor, professor, an official kind of monot...

Yeah, a post mate.

Are you a mate who delivers the post?

We call each other mate, but that's not something that the general public calls us.

Oh, okay.

And I would never appropriate that.

Bring it in, Rachel.

Oh, sorry.

I'm just in a great mood.

I'm sorry.

You have really long nails.

Yeah.

Those are like Alistair Crowley or something.

What?

You know, when you're out delivering the nails sometimes...

Trying to think of the person with the longest nails that I could, and I just took a shot at Alistair Crowley because he was a witch or a magician.

So I have no idea.

I've never even seen his fingernails.

I've seen him up there in the Hotel California cover, the Eagles album.

He's up there in the bell tower, I believe.

He was so cool.

But don't shout at the nails.

No, shout at the nails.

The mind get pretty long because, you know, I'm always...

He did have his hands on the window sill and you see like this shadow.

Yeah, that's why all of the young girls on TikTok go like, oh my god, my nails are so Alistair Crowley, you know, the cultists who claim to fuck the devil anyway.

Anyway, hi.

You're in a good mood.

Yeah, I'm in a great mood.

What's going on?

Well, Scott, I got a lot to tell you.

Oh, okay.

Well, we have a full segment devoted to you.

So this is good news because otherwise it would just be me and Rachel bullshitting for another 25 minutes or so.

No one wants to hear that.

Rachel, I want to tell you too.

I want to tell anyone who will listen, Scott.

I'm seeing somebody.

Great.

Oh.

You had not been up to now or?

Well, this is my most recent relationship.

I mean, I would hope so.

It's the fact it's currently going on.

Well, it's...

We've been together for about six months and, you know, before that it had been a little, you know, it had been a little while.

But...

Well, congrats.

So it's like your six months anniversary or...

Coming up.

Cool.

Coming up.

So you're just here to say you're seeing someone.

Well, yeah, I just wanted to tell you because, you know, we've had a few conversations before.

Have we?

I drop off your mail.

At the house or here?

At the studio.

Well, sometimes they have been messing around with my routes.

Is it different route every day?

This is a bad system for a mail carry.

I get...well, they give you the route that week.

But then you have to memorize it?

Yeah, you gotta memorize it.

You're not allowed to use GPS.

You have to be off book.

They don't...

Yeah, you have to be off book.

They don't have GPS in the mail trucks.

That's why they have a Tony award for postal carriers every.

Right.

I forgot about that.

That's right.

Because of the first mail carriers, name was Tony.

That's how they named the award.

Anthony.

Well, yeah.

Anthony Mail.

Anthony.

Which he got his name when he came over to Ellis Island.

They were like, what gender are you?

And he said mail.

And they thought that was just the idea I put in the wrong box.

Which of course, you know.

And that guy was then killed by the Unibomer.

Yeah.

So many years later.

After he...

He was a hundred...

He was a hundred hundred.

He was the about there.

The oldest Unibomer victim.

Yeah.

We don't want to talk about the Unibers.

Look, I don't want to talk about the Unibers.

Yeah.

Why are we bringing it down talking about Tony Mail?

I just want to talk about my new girlfriend.

So we had no mail questions for you at all.

No postal service.

No, no.

We're just here to talk about your girlfriend.

I just want to tell the world that I'm in love.

And it's crazy.

I mean, it's like a total opposites attract situation.

Really?

So like a Paul L. Abdul, MC Scott Cat kind of thing.

Exactly.

Opposites attract.

That was the name of that video.

That's right.

It's we are completely different people.

I mean, it's like she likes green beans.

I like shrimp.

You can like both or are you saying that you exclusively like those things?

She likes to read books.

I love to sing.

I'm a mailman.

She works for the DMV.

These are not opposites.

Right, Rachel?

And these are like just two separate things.

I'm telling you, we've got no business being together, but she's my missing piece.

I just I guess like my just a side question is how do you book this show?

I don't you know, to be honest, very surprised.

So yeah, I don't do.

So you're very surprised, but you're someone's here to plug their relationship.

Yeah, I'd unfortunately our producer Devin is out and we have Sam over here and Sam, you know, I mean, honestly, he's like sleeping in the other room right now.

To be honest, I don't even know what's going on with him.

I don't know how you got booked on.

I mean, did you just deliver the mail?

How did you get on the show?

No, I when I was delivering the mail, I saw the little clipboard that has the people that you book on the show.

And I put my name on there just because I'm so excited about my relationship.

It's a sign up sheet, essentially, is what we saw like John Ham.

And then you're just like, just put your name right there.

Slends are back, but and this guy, I guess.

And I love love.

Yeah, I heard that this place had an open door policy, but I thought I'll try to get to go through the regular channels.

The regular channel.

The regular channels.

Yeah, you know, I mean, it seems like this show, I say celebs are back, but it seems like we usually have a celeb on at the top of the show and then like, I mean, the show, it's like a small business owner and a poster worker.

I don't know, you know, but please tell us about your relationship.

I mean, this is like exciting for you.

We don't know you.

So this is, you know, it's less exciting for us, I guess.

Well, Scott, I don't know, like he'd just be happy for it.

I am.

Look, I'm genuinely happy for another human being when I hear that they are having a good time.

And this, you know, as human beings, we trick ourselves into thinking that our lives are bad so often that to see someone who's genuinely happy with where they're at, that brings a smile to my face.

Yeah.

And apparently to Rachel's, but she's mirroring me.

I would.

And staring at me.

Ha ha.

I love hosting this podcast.

I would also love to hear, I would just love to hear about more about more of the things that are opposites, like in rapid list for them.

Oh, yeah.

Well, I mean, there's like how rapid can you go?

Because you have sort of a slow voice.

You know, I don't talk a lot when I'm out on the road.

It's all time I talk to somebody.

A little, uh, stubble it over by words.

I understand.

But anyway, yeah, what are these opposites?

Well, it's like you've all been in this type of relationship before.

I say tomato.

She says potato.

Referring to the same thing or because she sounds when we're trying to have a conversation, I'm saying tomato.

I say she's saying potato.

Got it.

Normally when you are not having a conversation, you want to be saying the same thing.

I don't know.

We are just on totally different pages.

How does the stew turn out though?

The stew?

Yeah.

Sounds pretty.

I mean, I'm.

Presumably you're discussing a stew.

We're taping this at dinner time, by the way.

Rachel and I were salivating when you were talking about this.

That's the thing is that I used to always like an all tomato stew.

I mean, that was kind of my thing.

It sounds like tomato soup to me.

Is that what you're talking about with grilled cheese?

No, tomato stew with a little bit of a braised stewed tomatoes.

Is that what you're talking about?

Yeah.

Dude tomato.

Disgusting.

Well, that's what she said and learning.

Hey, already.

I hate it.

Finally, forgetting to some humor.

She's just opening up my mind all kinds of different things.

I did not think I was going to like a tomato potato stew, but it turns out the fact that she likes it, that makes me happy.

So she liked just eating like what?

Raw potatoes or?

Yeah.

Well, she wanted to have potatoes for dinner.

I was like tomato and she was like potatoes and I was like, we're talking about stew here.

Oh, okay.

She's like, let's put them in the stew.

Let's do it together.

Wow.

Congrats, man.

Thanks, man.

I'm just so happy about this.

So this is the rapid list that we're hearing.

You know, I can be stubborn.

She can be greedy.

She likes Joe Biden.

I think Al Gore should have won his particular presidential run.

Right.

Do you come from a universe in which Y2K happened?

Well, it happened for all of us, right?

Oh, like the apocalyptic event.

We're all computers.

Oh, the apocalyptic event?

No, that didn't happen.

Okay.

I just want to make sure that you weren't from a universe.

Oh, no.

You're talking about a lot of universe.

He's using Y2K to just refer to the rear.

Yeah.

Got it.

The rear.

Hey, look at that Y2K on that.

Yeah.

I just call him.

This issue is perfectly legal.

Look at this Y2K.

Is your ass Y2K?

Because it destroyed society.

I said that to her the other day.

Yeah.

And she was like, weird coincidence.

Yeah.

It is weird.

Now that I'm calling it out.

Yeah.

Maybe I never did that and I just thought I did after I heard her sing.

I think that's more likely.

Get back to this list.

I don't know.

I love this list.

I love it.

I'm from the rough side of the tracks.

She's from a place with no trains.

She likes to get dressed up and have drinks.

I like to wear a hat to bed.

Okay.

Now I'm what hat are you?

A pink bat.

Baseball cat.

Yeah.

Every single day.

Well, I like to.

I hope it just let you.

Well, sometimes you don't allow yourself to do it.

Well, sometimes I forget.

Sometimes she's like, we're trying to cut all the brim is sticking into my neck.

Could you possibly wear this beastie boy style?

Yeah.

And she suggested that and I was like, I don't do that.

But if it would make you happy, I'll try.

And guess what?

I actually kind of liked it.

Okay.

Good.

I don't know why you're wearing this hat to bed.

Well, you give the way when you're rolling over or you just.

Well, are you a face down sleeper?

Well, I used to be straight on my back sleeper with the brim pointing up.

Now I'm a side sleeper because I've got the beastie.

Beastie boys.

Right to the side.

So now I got it.

Yeah.

Got it.

But sometimes when I'm feeling a little bro-y, I'll sleep on my, I'll sleep on my stomach with the hat turned backwards.

Okay.

There we go.

But I think people who sleep face down are lunatics.

What do you think about this, Rachel?

When you say sleep face down, you're talking about someone whose entire face is in the pillow.

Yes.

All night.

Just like a corpse.

I would say 5% of the population does this.

Are you really?

Really?

Yeah.

There are people who sleep with their face in a pillow.

Yeah.

What do you think about this?

That's, I worry.

Yeah.

I feel like is there like, is there like, is there like, sids for adults?

It should be.

Thank you.

You're sad?

I mean, in the case, get back to this list.

Oh, you're on board.

I was just thinking about sads.

You thought we were just talking about it.

Yeah, I know.

That's why you were thinking about sads.

Or did I start thinking about it?

Oh, you heard us talk about it.

I think this list of opposites is really beautiful because I think the reason, if I had to guess the reason you're on here is what you really want to share about is like, the compromises you make.

Yeah.

I know.

And I never used to be this guy.

Yeah.

I mean, you know me, Scott.

I used to don't do it all actually, but go ahead.

I have a type.

I used to have a type.

Why would I know that?

Was it women who looked a lot like?

I thought we had some ties.

I dropped off some mail and we talked once.

We never, I have never spoken to you.

I used to always go after the girls who looked like envelopes.

Did you ever like, are you dating someone and you, and you realized, oh my gosh, she's exactly like it, like a Manila envelope?

I'm not allowed to mess with the envelopes.

But you know that there are people who look like envelopes.

Oh, yeah.

Like, would you go for envelope looking people?

Like wide mouth.

Wide mouth?

Metal thing in the middle.

Yeah.

Like a lot of like a grill.

One eye.

Uh, I'm trying to think of a person who looks like this.

No, the types of girls I used to always go for were girls who like shrimp and like to sing.

Mm.

Because we had a lot in common.

Yeah, because we had a lot in common.

It's just fearless.

I'm trying to think of.

Did anyone like to sing?

Well, she likes to read books.

But does she like to sing?

She'll sing along sometimes.

So it's really.

All right, let's get back to the list.

You having to open your phone and put in your password every time, by the way, is just slowing this down.

Okay, go ahead.

Did I ever date an envelope?

Back when I.

The mail trucks.

No, you're not talking about real envelopes.

No, I'm hanging up on that.

Oh, with people who look like.

Yeah, sure.

My apartment is a mess.

I'm sorry.

Her apartment has 65 crystal clear photographs of Sasquatch and other cryptid.

I mean, we should not be together.

We should not.

We are totally different.

All my friends.

Did she take these photographs?

Yeah, she did.

Oh, wait.

This is the bigger.

This is huge.

Yeah, this is huge.

That she has evidence of Sasquatch.

Yeah, and we talked to her instead or?

You want me to call her up?

Sure.

Yeah, this is, you know, she's a, she's always bringing up her cryptids whenever, you know, she's seeing how messy my apartment is.

Yeah.

Yeah, I have to talk about her cryptid.

Like, how does that go?

She's like, oh, this apartment is so messy.

She shouldn't it be more like, shouldn't it be more like mine?

These photos on the wall of Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster.

Bessie.

Who's Bessie?

No one.

Who's Bessie?

There's never been a Bessie.

Who's a cow.

That's how.

Exactly.

That's who I'm talking about.

Cows aren't cryptids.

No, they're not.

But they are animals.

Right?

Wait, wait, wait.

Can we agree?

We all know that cows definitely exist.

I think so.

I've seen one or two.

I've been trying to tell Jennifer that.

She does have a couple of pictures of cows in there.

As if regular cows.

Those are not cryptids, baby.

Yeah, I'm bell around the neck.

Does the Sasquatch photo, are we sure it's not just Robin Williams?

From that one episode of Mark.

From the more commend he's just torn apart.

But that's in a different universe, right?

Right.

The one where...

Yeah, that's a good point.

It's definitely not that.

It's not in our universe.

Do I too can't happen?

You're still on that.

Does it kind of look like Robin Williams?

Okay.

Let's get back to your list.

I'd love to hear more opposites.

Okay, swiping in goes the pass code.

Right.

iPhone 6.

Why do you have such an old iPhone?

Because I don't have a lot of money.

Oh, that's right.

That's right.

Okay.

She likes to have a laugh with friends.

I'm always getting stuck in elevators.

Why?

Well, because I have to deliver the mail and sometimes you go inside.

If you have a big package, you got to take it up to there.

But the getting stuck part.

No, that's what I'm stuck on.

Speaking of stuck, why are you stuck in these elevators?

Well, sometimes I don't know how to work it.

Every...

The button?

The elevator.

It's a different elevator every time I'm going.

Yeah, but they all have...

It's a standard system of buttons.

You press a button.

Yeah.

Oh, this is why you're getting stuck.

You're just entering the elevator and you're not pressing a button.

The number refers...

So it just stays.

There's...

The number refers to what floor you want to be on.

And it counts upwards from the bottom.

Oh, see, I was always...

They're ascending rather than descending.

Oh.

See, I would go in there and then I would just kind of wait.

And then at some point the elevator would start moving.

Right, because someone has called it.

And then I would get out and there'd be another person there.

And I'd look around and...

So you know enough to press the button to make it open?

Yeah.

I just have to say I'm very sorry because the system has failed you.

Yeah.

You need to money back guarantee from your teacher.

Look, teachers and mailmen were thickest thieves.

I'm not arguing.

I couldn't tell if it was going to be an opposite.

Teachers and mailmen are pretty much the exact same...

Two sides at the same point.

Yeah.

Unlike Joker in the Batman.

Yeah.

Unlike people work at the DMV.

Right.

Exactly.

Completely different.

Okay.

Any more on this list?

How long would it take for you to open your phone again?

Well, let's see.

I'm trying to do it now.

Scrolling.

Why do you have to scroll?

Are you scrolling away from it every time you say one of these?

She likes to smoke cigarettes.

I actually kind of like to eat green beans.

I think you mentioned that at the top.

What the top...

It was her that likes the green beans.

She likes green beans.

Oh, right, right.

So let's list your likes food wise.

Okay.

Green beans.

Sort of.

For sure.

I love shrimp.

Stute tomatoes.

And now tomato potatoes stew.

I'm kind of...

You're working that in there.

You're working it.

Yeah.

Okay.

Good.

I don't like cigarettes.

Don't like cigarettes.

She does.

Right.

And does she like...

Yes, she does like green beans.

Okay.

Good.

Yeah, she likes green beans a lot.

I don't know why she likes you.

Because you seem like a weird dude.

I don't know why she likes me either, man.

All the signs are pointing to this should never work, but I'm telling you it does.

Mainly because of what an odd person you are.

Getting into L of random elevators, just sitting there for hours.

I'm not the one with the totas of Sasquatch on my wall.

This is a good point.

She sounds weird too.

Okay.

Yeah, you're made for each other.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

That's all I wanted to say.

Wow.

Okay.

Do you have any mail for him?

Do I have any mail for him?

Yeah.

Right here.

Oh, thank you.

What is this?

It's already.

Yeah.

It's from the Scientology Center.

Oh my God.

I've been accepted.

We accepted you based on your...

Oh, your scientists.

I'm not supposed to say that.

I'm a mailman.

I heard they can deny it if anyone asks them, by the way.

That was a new wrinkle I just heard.

Okay, look, we have to take a break.

When we come back, we have a small business owner.

Silebs are back, baby.

We'll be right back with more Rachel Bloom, more Chris Orchard.

We'll be right back with more comedy bam bam bam.

After this.

Bum bum bum bum bum.

Comedy bam bam bam.

We're back.

Rachel Bloom is here.

We have reboot, of course, on Hulu, which almost rhymes.

You have to admit that.

Reboot.

No, I don't have to admit that.

Hulu.

You don't have to.

I don't have to do anything.

Come on, man.

Back me up.

You're my wingman on this show.

Oh, no.

We also have Chris Orchard is here, postal worker to the stars.

To one.

To one?

Yeah.

Rachel, I can deliver your mail to you to the universe.

Do I have a say?

Yeah.

Do I have a...

You can request a specific...

Really?

Well, because, I mean, these days they're getting...

Obviously, they're changing their routes all the time.

So they're trying to make it...

Well, sometimes I'm taking it to your house, sometimes I'm taking it here.

Seems kind of like it's a...

It's a little strange.

It sounds like a gerrymandering situation.

There might be some corruption there.

I'm looking into it.

You are.

I'm a good.

Yeah, because I'm...

Your spare time or on company time?

On company time.

Well, sometimes on my spare time, sometimes on company time.

Here's my question.

When I'm with my coworkers, I got to ask them to be like, how do we all feel about the fact that they keep messing with all the routes?

It seems like they're doing...

Here's my question.

When you're done delivering the mail and it's like you're three hours early, do you still get paid for those three hours or are you trying to do it as slowly as possible in order to get paid longer?

Well, I tend to be a little bit of a slower guy.

I've noticed that.

So I like to take my time with things and I'm not in any rush.

And when I've got some downtime, I've got time to look into what's going on.

The corruption's up top.

Yeah, it goes all the way to the top from what I hear.

That's what I think.

President of the United States.

If it does, then I'm coming after him.

Okay.

Well, I look forward to that.

Well, let's get to our next guest.

He's a small business owner and I'm pleased to punch to announce that he's been on the show several times.

He's the owner of Kissy's Grocers in Downey, California.

Is that right?

That's right, Scott.

And please welcome back to the show Albert Rowe.

Hello.

Hey, Scott.

Thanks for having me.

Are you okay?

You didn't say hello, everyone.

Yeah.

Hello, everyone.

Yeah.

Hello.

I just...

Things haven't been going so hot.

I don't know if you remember, last time I was here.

I proclaimed that I was...

You don't remember anything about the last time you saw me?

Not really.

Not a single thing.

It's been purged from my memory.

Go ahead and remind me.

Last time I was here, I said I was fucked.

Things were going really bad.

I had to sort of alter the business in a couple of ways.

We joined the metaverse.

A lot of stuff just not going great.

Some of you might not know, Rachel, we've never been before.

What was your name?

My name's Chris Orchard.

Chris.

I'm feeling bad.

Oh, wow.

That's not a hug what you're doing, by the way.

No, yeah, you're scratching.

You're doing a big scratch because Alistair's.

Sorry.

Just trying to cheer you up.

You know, I got a little something from it.

You know, nobody's getting me a hug in a long time.

I've been...

What's going on?

I've been completely alone.

I had to purge my entire staff at the grocery store.

No.

And the thing you got to know about my groceries...

Layoffs?

Mass layoffs.

And I had to do it myself.

Do you think he said, meant that he killed everyone?

Maybe.

I don't know what he does there.

I did not kill anyone.

Somebody did die during the process and it had nothing to do with it.

Okay.

Yeah.

Really?

But on your...

During company time and on the ground.

It was a fucking mess, man.

Are you insured for that?

Yeah, I have pretty good insurance.

You know, I'm a massive inherited wealth.

Yeah, your Jeff Bezos is my...

Jeff Bezos is my...

That's my paternal father.

Yeah, my paternal father.

Your paternal father.

My paternal father.

That's right.

Yeah.

The other thing about Albert, for those of you who are listening for the first time and also Rachel.

Yeah.

And probably Chris, although maybe you deliver his mail.

But...

Sometimes.

You get all the way up to Downey?

When they tell me to.

That's really far.

That's too far for him.

That's a different county.

Yeah.

But Kisses is a grocery store out there where you have one, what pretty much one's promise that you promise every customer.

I will kiss every single item in the store.

That's my guarantee.

I give it a nice polish and a nice smooch.

Not in front of the people you do this beforehand.

No.

I'm not going to add it though.

We have started doing backroom kissing sessions if you want to pay a premium.

Because look, I got to keep the lights on.

It's not going good.

This is a failing business at this point.

I can't imagine COVID was kind to you.

No.

And I was also not kind to COVID.

We did not adhere to any of the restrictions.

It's like an opposites attract kind of situation.

Yeah.

It's sort of like a MC Skatcat and polyep stool sort of thing.

Oh, I've made that reference before.

Is that the name of that song?

Yeah, I think so.

I don't know if I because I heard that, but I don't know if I thought of it because you said it.

Oh, I see.

Okay, you were here for that.

But I yeah, we just did not adhere to any event.

A lot of people got COVID in my store, but it was because in that during that time, business was booming because a lot of people did not want to wear a mask at the store.

They didn't want to do six feet.

Well, also you sold exclusively toilet paper from what I was reading.

I sold a lot of toilet.

We yeah, you hoarded it essentially.

We hoarded it and that we sold one sheet each.

Yeah, so that would make it last.

Every sheet.

That's right.

Before they use it, of course.

Okay.

Don't be crass Scott.

I know you probably are thinking I kissed it after they wiped.

I was seeing they were trying to figure that out.

Yeah, but some people are using it in the store.

We do not allow customers to use the bathroom at our store, just people who are stopping by.

Why?

Just to be the opposite.

Usually like if you're a customer, they let you use the bathroom.

But if you're not a customer, they don't.

I tell you, when I was growing up, they didn't have bathrooms.

They had an employee bathroom in every grocery store.

And if you ever had to use it, I was a little boy and they would just be like, you had to go into this dark room.

Yeah.

It was very frightening.

Now they have these beautiful, beautiful bathrooms.

Gorgeous, beautiful bathrooms.

Gorgeous.

You had to go into this dark room.

Into a dark room and it is.

Was there a man in there?

Yeah, there was this nice gentleman.

Oh, yeah.

So that wasn't a bathroom.

What?

Oh, you can use our bathroom.

But it's the scary one for employees only.

Yeah, I remember going through these like the plastic strips that we're hanging down.

Yes.

Separate the back from the.

So close to where they store the milk.

I had to go through the cold.

Yeah, I had to go through where they stored the milk.

It was so freezing.

It'd be freezing.

Yeah.

But are those plastic strips a barrier to entry to anyone?

I think they must.

I mean, certainly they stopped the cold from coming out.

Oh, that's a good point.

Okay.

Good point.

Plastic stops cold.

Yeah, plastic stops cold.

It's on that's written on the walls in our store.

My store is made of glass also.

Just so people know, like, what are these?

What are these plastic?

What's this plastic doing here?

Don't fucking ask me.

It says it right there.

Plastic stops the cold.

Okay.

That have been like an alternative to masking in the pandemic.

Could we all have worn kind of plastic?

Plastic strips like like Zoidberg and Futurama just kind of billowing in front of our face.

I've been trying to dress like Zoidberg more often.

So that would I would love to have loved that.

Yeah, I probably would have come.

I would have complied with that.

It's Zoidberg adjacent.

I would have loved.

Yeah, I also love anything Zoidberg adjacent.

Nearly shrimp.

Zoidberg loves shrimp.

That is a detail from his character at Futurama.

That's right.

He loves it.

Don't know what he is.

He is it.

He also kind of is, isn't he?

Yeah, he's sort of he's got to all eat things that we look like.

That's true.

Anyway, why are you here?

I'm here because I've tried to diversify the business now.

We started as a grocery.

She's trying to reverse the biz.

Metaverse didn't work.

And NFTs didn't work.

Our app Kisses Prime didn't work.

But we're sort of rebranding the app Kisses Prime.

And I'm happy to say we're getting into content, baby.

Okay.

We're getting into content.

We're seeing there's a massive hole in the business.

There's not enough streamers anymore.

They're purging content from websites and stuff.

I mean, it would be great to have another streamer who would buy things.

Yeah.

Well, we're trying to pick up anything that will come over.

You know, especially anything that's left my father's business, Amazon Prime.

They would not sell us.

They would not sell us Lord of the Rings.

They would not do it.

What about paper girls?

They're not giving you that?

They would not give no they destroyed it.

They canceled paper girls and they also were like, you know, he burned it right in front of me.

I was like, Father, please.

Can I have paper girls?

That's a burning $300 in front of us.

That's how much I offered for it.

I don't got a lot of money anymore.

I'm fucked here.

Yeah, they're coming for your neck from what I understand.

They're coming for my neck.

And just so you know, it is.

Yeah.

So now you thought I was in trouble with us grocery stores.

Now I got Hulu barking down my neck.

I got Netflix.

Wait, wait, like, because they want your content or they're or they're doing it.

Or they want you to get out.

They don't want me to get in this business because they know I'll be too good at it.

Oh, they're going to say, oh, everyone's going to go.

What's the content you're eyeing?

Well, you know, we are trying to I'm trying to go after a lot of content.

You know, after a lot of canceled programming to make people happy because, you know, people missed these shows that were canceled.

Obviously we did not succeed with Paper Girls.

We are trying, we are trying to get House of Cards on our show on our platform.

I don't know if that was canceled.

Yeah.

You think it ended?

I don't know.

I think maybe went on too long, some might say.

We're trying to get that.

We're trying to get.

You're getting it back with K-Space?

Well, look, I'm trying to just revive the whole thing.

I'm just going to get whatever people.

Interesting that a guy got his new name.

Yeah, Kysos.

That's right.

K-Packs?

No, K-Packs?

K-Space.

We're trying to and we're trying to make his Christmas videos.

K-Space.

That's true.

Yeah.

Well, we're trying to make his Christmas videos canon to the show as well.

So we're trying to canonize that.

We're going to store the cards versus the hashtag if you want to participate in that.

No, thank you.

Thank you.

We are doing unscripted as well.

We are shocked.

What do you mean?

You know your whole thing about you kiss everything?

Oh, yeah.

My kissing the...

Yeah.

Every episode, every real of every episode that we release.

So every 20 minutes or so?

Every 20 minutes.

That's right.

I kissed film.

Some of it's film.

Shooting on film.

Yeah, we're shooting it on film and that's harder to stream than digital.

With projectors and like people moving.

Yeah, so we have a projector going on a big screen and then we have a digital out camera filming the film projection.

That's good for projection.

Oh, it's like how you do old home movies.

Yeah.

Yeah, that's how it's a transfer.

It's sort of like a transfer.

Yeah, but you know, you have to...

Somebody has to change the reel 20 minutes in later.

So we do that.

Slice three-alls together.

Look.

All that stuff's above my pay grant.

I'm just funding the operation.

But you're also kissing everyone.

Yeah, I'm also kissing every single thing.

There's also...

There's going to be a kissies and chills sort of the situation where if you want, I will come over to your house and I'll give you and your partner a kiss on the forehead while you watch something for a little bit and then start smanging.

I'm just curious how...

How what?

How me too affected you?

How?

I did great during it.

I came in on top.

More the same?

Yeah, more of this.

Nothing...

Everything writes itself.

Yes.

There was a little bit of a hiccup with me too, but eventually it got, you know, back to me.

Yeah, of course, correct it.

I sort of...

Let's just say I didn't do it for a little while.

I see.

But it's also...

I'm not kissing anybody without their consent either.

It is sort of like...

Hey, this is what goes on in here.

If you don't want any of that...

Without their implied consent.

No, because I remember I passed out buttons that say it's fine for me to do this.

Oh, that's right.

It's fine for you to do this.

Give me that smooch.

That's very progressive.

Yeah, thank you very much.

I'm gonna try.

You know, I guess I'm a woke king.

It's hard.

But it's, you know, not for me, because actually it actually comes really easy to me because I'm a good guy.

Are you a good kisser?

No complaints thus far.

I'll tell you that.

Really?

Yeah.

Really.

Boy, who's gonna complain?

A pancake?

An apple?

A can of soup?

These people?

You say you're gonna be here?

It actually sounds a lot like the cast of the Juma Child show I'm doing.

Yeah, BB Newworth had no complaints.

Nobody, it's hard to mess up a kiss on the forehead.

I guess you could make it a little too wet or too long.

But it's like, there's not a really, it's not a, there's not a back and forth.

I can't ever kiss anyone on the lips.

Well, Scott, I don't know what you want me to say here.

Can we stop for a second?

You want to shut down?

I'm sorry, just to stop for a second.

Yeah, I promise I won't work for this part.

Yeah.

I guess I just didn't know you were gonna fucking try to got you at me today.

What the fuck is this?

I apologize.

I mean, you talk about kissing so much, I thought that...

Yeah, I talk about it.

You don't ask me where I've kissed.

What?

I mean, you, I'm supposed to ask you questions, right?

This is humiliated here.

Along monologue, I know you were probably prepared to do just along monologue about it.

I've prepared so much.

Your content you were gonna buy and...

All this content.

But I'm sorry, but I, but have you ever kissed anyone?

I mean, it's okay if you haven't.

Could you promise me that it's just not gonna be at the show?

I'll tell you off air.

Yeah, well, so we stopped recording.

Yeah.

Well, because you know I have 11 children.

Yeah, but do you do pretty woman rules?

That's what I call it.

Really?

First, I gotta smack your hand.

With a ring box or whatever.

Yeah, with a ring box.

I've never seen it.

Before that, I deny you entry into a business.

Okay.

I'm sort of guessing what the plot might be.

Jason Alexander involved in this?

He is not involved in this at all.

Hector Alexander?

I think this is the cast, right?

I think so.

Richard Gere's there?

Sure.

Well, of course.

Yeah.

Even I know that.

There's no Gerbal Heidenar hair near anywhere near anybody.

Is he constantly sort of rubbing his butt kind of going like, ow.

Let's just say he's not sitting down quick.

In pretty woman.

Yeah, but to answer your question, and then we can get back into the show.

Please.

I've never kissed him a lips before.

This is sad.

Well, we started the show by kissing.

It's the most natural thing to do when you're on a show.

Yeah.

Do you want?

I don't know.

Do you want to finally kiss someone?

Do you want to kiss both of us?

I guess.

I mean me.

Oh, I forgot you were here.

Honestly.

You haven't talked to 15 minutes.

Jesus Christ, man.

You scared me.

Okay.

I will fucking get it.

Dude.

Clear your throat or something before you talk.

It's like fucking creepy.

All right.

Hey, man.

No, come on.

Yeah, you can kiss her.

You can kiss too, I guess, if you're into it.

Yeah, if this is like, is this something we all agree to?

I'll kiss all of you, and then we can just get back into the show, and then I'll answer appropriately that yes, I have done that.

Okay.

Should we do it four way or do you want to do one at a time?

I think just four for experience.

Four way, yeah.

Yeah, we got to get it.

That way you can all sort of get it at once.

All right, here we go.

All right.

Oh, wow.

I'll stop hugging her.

She's real long fingernails.

Sorry.

Oh, wow.

Okay.

That was good.

Okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

Do you want to come back to the show?

All right.

Okay.

I'm sorry that I got so.

Sam, let's pick it back up here.

Here we go.

And sorry.

Okay.

I'm going to point at you.

Okay.

Ready?

Three.

I've kissed on the lips before and everyone fucking loves it.

Oh, God.

Yeah.

I don't know how I would have added that last part.

How did you feel about it, Rachel?

I thought it was fun.

I've only had one best kiss I've ever had.

Everything else was dog shit.

For me, it was kind of Jesus fucking Christ.

Dude.

You had to tell us you're here.

I do?

I'm sitting here.

You're like human amnesia.

I forget that you're here.

You've also been like, I don't know, you've been hiding in that bag of mail.

Yes.

Well, after you started talking about envelopes.

You got a horn?

I thought maybe I'm trying all these new things lately.

Maybe I'd try out envelopes.

Okay.

I'll announce I'm here every time I talk.

Okay.

Or at least if it's got to be like a good five minutes.

Okay.

You don't have to if we're in the middle of a conversation because obviously we've been.

Okay.

Oh, Jesus fuck.

Okay.

That didn't scare me.

I'm talking.

I'm saying okay.

Okay, great.

All right.

Albert.

Yes.

So you've kissed on the lips.

I've kissed on the lips to much acclaim.

And you know, it's obviously a big part of my business and I want people to know that like just because they're watching something on TV doesn't mean that they can't also have that experience.

Right.

I'll kiss the I'll go down to the where the the server warehouse kiss all the servers too.

Why not?

What?

You know, like they have to have to get things on the internet.

There's like large warehouse.

Oh, I thought you were talking about servers like at a restaurant.

No, I know you love talking about restaurants, but that's not what I talk about at all.

What are you listening to my other show?

Yeah.

Restaurant roundup.

I love restaurant roundup.

Oh, okay.

Always nice to meet a fan.

I mean, yeah, I I I I hope this turns the business around for me because I know that.

People love stream and people love paying for subscriptions.

Yeah.

So I love paying like a small amount of money for a lot of things.

They love that.

And the line, it's like a tapas, but for TV.

Yeah.

And that's sort of what we say at, yeah, at Kissy's Prime.

We did things a little differently around.

Have you been with us before?

Yeah.

Have you watched every single time you turn on the TV?

How much is the subscription?

Okay.

So don't be mad.

You can't start with that.

I just you can't be mad.

You can work out if we're mad.

I mean, yeah, I just need you to promise me that you can't be upset.

I can't promise you like an emotion.

I can promise you an action.

I can't promise you an emotion.

Okay.

I won't act in rage, but I I'm going to feel however I'm going to feel.

Okay.

So it's fucking expensive.

Okay.

Some of this stuff.

Because we're not it's it's we wouldn't be mad if it were free.

How much is it?

Okay.

So you wouldn't be mad.

That's good feedback to have.

If it was free, you wouldn't be mad.

We wouldn't be mad.

But based on our reaction to it.

I just you know, it's it's it's in beta right now.

So we are charging $50 a week for the service week.

Yes.

But think about what you're getting.

You're getting new episodes.

What are you haven't even this up of potentially has a cards.

It's right now it's blank.

Only thing you've mentioned.

So I'm paying $50 for a blank streaming service.

The only thing you've mentioned actually is Kevin space.

He's Christmas videos.

Yeah.

We will we have that stuff.

I just I sent that you know I typed in YouTube to MP for download.

This is all stuff that's on YouTube already though.

Like exclusive content.

Well, I'm telling I was trying to tell you about my kisses unscripted series.

But you had no interest in it.

You wanted to go blue and ask me if I've kissed on the lips before pervert.

I'm sorry.

Tell us about your unscripted show.

That's a good.

Thank you for asking me.

It's a reality show set in my grocery store.

Wherein you see me kissing the items and such.

I'm here right now.

I'm announcing my presence.

Okay.

Thank you.

I'm speaking.

Okay.

Good.

I've got an idea for a show.

Yeah, man.

Were you in the running and all for Scott's AirPod show?

We did.

We lost a bidding war over the air pod.

Yeah, your dad got it.

Yeah, he got it.

So happy.

My friend spam called me.

But you know what?

You know why he got it?

You can't risk.

She's so hot.

I hate to judge her.

You can't say that.

You can't judge her on her physical attributes.

You can't say that anymore.

You are working with her.

She is your executive.

She's so fucking hot.

You can't not say that about Ms. Risk.

Can you call her a smoke show?

No.

Okay.

Unless she's made a smoke.

That's what the S stands for.

Smoke show, Pam Risk.

Now you probably feel.

Yeah, you feel stupid, don't you?

Wow.

Now I know why I'm sneezing.

You feel so bad?

Bad?

That's what they're not really talking about.

He feels really bad.

Yeah.

He's so, he's like horrified that he did this.

You know why my dad picked up the movie?

And I hate to put this, you know, type of negativity out there.

Yeah.

He wanted it because I wanted it.

A classic sort of like big dicking me.

Yeah.

Still he wanted it.

Yeah.

Sorry.

I thought you said a classic big dick in me and I was, I thought you just revealed something terrible.

No, there was a G.

Yeah.

Okay.

I'm good.

Good.

Yeah, yeah, no.

Yeah.

No.

Well, Albert, I don't know that this is going to work.

I hate for you to come in depressed every single time, but it seems like every single time you come on the show, you're depressed because the previous thing you talked about this work.

So you do remember the last time I was here?

No.

That's interesting.

I just remember your general countenance, which is always depressed.

Look, my life's hard.

You know how hard it is to be a billionaire because I've inherited wealth?

It's not easy.

People think it's easy because, oh yeah, I have all the money in the world.

I can do whatever I want.

It's hard.

Starting a streaming service.

I don't even know how a computer works.

Okay.

We got to get you both.

By the way, you're still here.

We got to get you.

I'm here.

Yeah.

Now I'm taking to announcing that you're here.

We got to, we got to get you both lessons about things.

You need computer lessons.

We need the geek squad on this.

You for elevators?

They have geek squad for elevators.

Hmm.

I think that's just known as an elevator repair.

If it's a fancy building where there's an attendant, that might be a geek squad for elevators.

Yeah.

They're doing a private residence, kind of the doorman.

Yeah.

That's your show.

That's the show.

That's your prestige streaming show.

Listen to Rachel.

She's an elevator attendant.

Yes.

He sees everybody.

Interesting.

Can I be the star?

Why are you asking me?

I think we need to go diverse.

I'm sorry.

Okay.

That's fair enough.

That's fair.

I'll accept that.

That's fine.

I have no issues with that.

Can I be in it?

Oh, she's fucking shit.

I don't know if you could be in it because I don't know if anyone will notice you're in it.

Yeah.

I don't know if the cameras pick you up.

Are you gonna have freaking vampire?

I'm a mailman.

Yeah.

Those aren't opposites.

They're pretty opposite to me.

Okay, what's the opposite of a vampire?

I guess mailman they do deliver during the day.

Yes.

That's right.

Okay.

And they eat a lot of garlic.

The opposite of vampires mailman.

Yeah.

Okay.

It's honestly up to opposites thus far.

That's closest.

All right, look guys.

We're gonna get a time.

We only have time for one final feature on the show.

That's a little something called plugs.

Stop lights for fun songs.

Ooh, I love the length on that.

That was Scott likes short plug songs by Ryan Keaton.

Thank you so much to Ryan Keaton for that.

And let's plug it up.

Rachel, what do you want to plug here?

I mean, I think we got a circle back to kiss and tell.

Which is already out.

Came at September 20th.

Yeah.

Wherever you get your audio books and reboot on Hulu.

Come for Keegan Microkey.

Stay for the lizard arm.

That's right.

Okay.

Two great things to plug.

Man, what a week to be you.

Out of all the weeks of the year.

This week.

The final week of September.

The final week of September is always a week to be anyone.

We only get it one week a year.

Okay.

What's your name?

Chris.

Chris Orchard.

I'm here.

What do you want to plug?

Well, there's a guy that I sometimes deliver mail to when I'm doing it.

It's my route.

Yeah, we got a name.

Name James Mannion.

I just like the guy.

And I want y'all to follow him on Twitter at pizzamanion.

Maybe he can get a new phone, you know, if it gets a follow-up.

Do you think the old part of the phone as well was so slow about this?

Because it seems very simple.

You just swipe.

It's open.

Oh, is it the not recognizing your face part?

You got to enter the code.

I actually deactivated the passcode.

So I wasn't even doing that.

And I'll be honest.

I'm not sure why it took me so long.

I guess, like I said before, I'm just a stubborn person.

I'm a burn guy.

I'm like my girlfriend who's greedy.

That's true.

All right, Alvar, what do you want to plug?

Well, I do want to say that my reality show on Kissy's Prime is also called Kiss and Tell.

So I will be seeing you in Court Rachel.

Oh, good.

And I'm sorry, but I just, you know, that's just how it is.

That's show business, as they say.

Don't know if it is not.

It's not show business.

No, no, none of that was show business.

Oh, okay.

I love show friends, although they should, shouldn't they?

Such a great ring to the friends.

Especially the friends.

Yeah, friends.

Oh, friends.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, I hate that musical.

What friends?

Show friends.

Let's just move on.

Let's move on.

What else do you got, Alvar?

You can listen to, there's this podcast that I really like.

I blasted in the grocery store.

Really?

Yeah.

Do people enjoy that?

Yeah, they like it when a podcast is too loud.

And they like to shop, hearing people have overlapping conversations.

Overlapping, boring conversations.

Yeah.

It's called Get Played.

It's a video game show, toasted by Heather Ann Campbell, Nick Weiger and Manopadaka.

You can check that out.

And their anime premium series on patreon.com slash Get Played or on Stitcher Premium.

It's really nice that everyone chooses to plug for other people.

Yeah, it's so nice.

I mean, I'm just going to plug myself.

Although other people are involved.

Hey.

Okay.

Here it is.

I'm here to plug Alberts Tummy.

No.

I'm here to plug.

This is a huge announcement.

Comedy Bang Bang has a book coming out.

Wow.

That's right.

A book is coming out in April, 2023.

This has been a massive undertaking.

Basically what it is, it's edited by myself and it has all of your favorite guests on the show writing and making their own pieces.

It's advertisements that they have, essays that they've written.

It includes a lot of things like pamphlets and board games.

Just anything that your favorite characters have decided to submit for this book, it is in there.

It's really incredible.

Maybe a grocery store newsletter perhaps is in the book.

Maybe Scott?

I believe I found one of those grocery store newsletters and I put it into the book.

I hope that's okay.

From my store?

From your store.

You're just bringing it up for many stores.

I wasn't sure if you put one of my competitors in there.

No, I don't know.

Kisses store pamphlet is in there.

Thank God.

I'm glad I didn't lose out to another one.

We also have great people doing the introductions Lin-Manuel Miranda, Weirdo Yankovic, Bob Odenkirk, Tatiana Maslani, Patton Oswalt, Jack Quaid.

They're all doing introductions for it.

Right now you can order this book.

You can pre-order the book.

It comes out in April.

If you head over to CBBWorld.com.

Book, all the links are there and I am doing several autographed editions of it.

The links to those are at Barnes and Noble and Indigo and those are at the top of that page.

You can click on those and order those, but you can get it from wherever your favorite bookseller is.

And I do hope you have a favorite bookseller.

Head over to CBBWorld.com.com. for more info on that.

This is huge.

Very excited about it.

All right.

Let's close up the old plug bag.

Will you call a hoochie?

Oh, no.

I know.

Oh, I know.

Yes, exactly. Oh, no. We think.

Yeah, like oh no or whatever. Oh, no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. I know.

Oh no Eric, it did you. Open up your house. Have you lost your f***ing mind? Ah, I was oh no, it's Danger Doom by King Love Duck Electricity. A bunch of gibberish. Guys, thank you so much Rachel. Always a pleasure to have you on.

Please come back again. Really enjoyed having you on. This is my pleasure and I didn't even get to introduce. I'm not crazy at Mod. She's been here the whole time. March! Oh no, we don't have time. I don't know.

Oh, our catchphrase this year. Bring it in, March. Oh, I love being scratched. Oh, she loves it. I'm an exhibit. Thanks to you, Chris Orchard.

Great to have you and your weird hugs and your student tomatoes. By the way, you brought a whole pot of student tomatoes here with you. You just opened them up. Yeah, well, my girlfriend didn't want these. Yeah, of course she did. This is the one thing I'm on her side about. It's like I would prefer of just eating a raw potato to this giant vat of student tomatoes. Well, then you're just like her because that's what she wants to do. Yeah, well, anyone would want to do that.

March, what about you? Did you forget how you talk? I'm just going to announce my sale.

Albert, good luck to you, buddy. You know you're one of my best friends. Hey, that's true. And you know what? Just because I hurt that, maybe next time, I'll be in a better mood. Hope you're in a better mood next time we see you.

Thanks. All right, do you promise I mean, such is life. Who could say? All right. All right, we'll see you next time. Thanks. Bye.

Bye.

You I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a shot.
