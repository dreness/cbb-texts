♪♪♪ Noah's falling, the air is crisp, if only I had someone to fist, welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

I mean...

Ahh...

I mean, thank you so much to Aaron Lehman 517 at gmail.com.

I guess we should...

I mainly wanted to read it just to read that person's username.

I wonder if it's...

Their username?

That's their username.

I wonder if it's that person or if it's that person sending a bunch of emails to their friend?

I don't know what it is, but...

So you may have inadvertently docked someone.

Sure.

This is a satirical show, so we can say anything and call it comedy.

We can give anyone's home phone and address.

Who knows?

Whatever happens with that, I apologize or don't apologize.

Whatever happens to maybe Jane.

Who knows?

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang, best of 2020 part four.

We're counting down the top four episodes of the year on this show.

Scott, this is it.

For countdowns from 16 to number one, this is the part that's happening to me.

It's the one that you dream of.

This is a part everyone wants to listen to.

Weirdly enough, every year we do four parts and the part one is the one that most people listen to and then the numbers dwindle.

And you'd think they would increase.

Because they're outraged.

Yes, probably.

Do you think people think it's in reverse order and they think like, oh, they start with the best one?

No, I think that people who have never heard the show before are interested and then listen to one and say, enough of that and never listen again.

Come on.

Scott, that can't be true.

I think people think it's a count up.

It could be.

And they're like, well, why are they listening to this?

It doesn't even matter.

I'm game.

It really doesn't matter.

This is all made up anyway.

It just doesn't matter spaghetti.

Spaghetti.

Meatballs.

That's right.

Here's what people need to know.

You voted.

My name is Scott Ockerman, by the way, and Paul of Tomkins is right across.

That is my name in my backyard.

Here's what you need to know.

You voted on these.

We ignore that.

We have a big hat filled with episode titles.

Yep.

And not even episode titles of episodes previously.

No.

We had to go record new episodes to fit those titles.

Yeah.

The first one picked out the one with ugly naked guy.

What?

That was a character on Friends that we never saw for obvious reasons.

But so mean when you think about it now.

That, I mean, it's one thing that he's naked, fine.

Let it be naked.

Come on, just because you're the most attractive six people.

Yeah.

Man, I hated all those people.

I hated them.

I'm playing Lisa Kudra.

You're the last former best friend.

The last episode.

I was just talking about how much I liked her if you.

Guys, listen to that previous one.

Come on.

It's a spherical show, remember?

A spherical show.

We can say anything.

And speaking of saying anything, we're going to say everything about these top four episodes.

I'm holding a boombox above my head.

That's the top four episodes.

What if...

Would someone please...

Would someone please take that image and just play the top four clips?

Please take that clip of John Q. Sack holding the boombox over his head to win the love of Ioni Skye and instead of in your eyes by Peter Gabrielle, put in one of the top four clips.

Ioni Skye, of course, an avid listener of our sister show, Freedom, I believe.

That's right.

I don't know whether she listens to this show, but...

Why would she?

Of course.

If you're listening to Freedom, that's the absolute limit for an Ioni Skye.

You know what's...

Skye is the limit!

This Skye.

This Skye has a limit.

Whoa, did you think she ever says...

Who has two thumbs and wants to kick the shit out of you?

This Skye and points at herself.

I hope so.

I hope she does.

Listen to this episode for a good suggestion, Ioni, and then go back to Freedom if you want.

Um...

Do you know what song was originally playing on that boombox when they filmed the show?

The boombox when they filmed it, that John Cusack wanted to put in instead of Peter Gabe.

Back to a man by Clarence Carter.

That's right.

No, it was shaving cream.

My doctor depends on...

He just gets credit for all the songs that he plays on his show.

No, didn't he actually sing that one though?

Did he really?

I felt like he sang shaving cream every time that it was...

I thought Dr. Demento was an aggregator.

Like a fuck Jerry.

I was a tweet I did!

I know, I saw this one.

That's fun.

I read your tweets.

Ha ha ha!

I read your tweets.

Um, no, I think it was a fishbone song.

You know, John Cusack was really into fishbone, so he picked like a really punky, like, mosh-pity-type song to get across that he was so torn up over the relationship that he felt like all punk rock about it.

And I think Cameron Crow was like, uh, yeah, why don't we do this song instead?

How about a song somebody would like to hear?

No shit on fishbone, but come on.

You're not gonna woo any girls with fishbone.

I, of course, was a big fishbone fan growing up and never got one date out of it.

So I, uh, commiserate with him.

But you thought that was your game?

You're like, ever heard of fishbone?

Yeah, I go to their show.

I'm not invited you to work.

I like to move your head.

What smells like fish?

It's not that kind of a show.

I'm sorry that the very beginning of this episode, but look.

Biony.

As Biony.

Biony.

That, that, that, that, that.

Ah, the music man.

Oh, the music man.

Meredith Wilson, writer of the music man.

That's right.

Meredith Wilson.

Why are you on password?

The music man.

Mink, mink, mink, mink, mink, mink.

I used to love that sort of clock noise during the pyramid, the final pyramid.

Yeah.

Where, uh, it was, you know, they'd sit there.

Bink.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It was really effective.

Yeah.

That's the one thing I asked my agent if I could do.

That was a good game show.

Is it still, did they reboot it?

They, they had rebooted it.

And so I, I was like, look, I don't ask you if I could be on anything.

I would like to be on pyramid.

And then they came back to me and said, yeah, you're, unfortunately, they're having bigger celebrities on.

I went, okay.

Yeah, I get it.

And then, you know, who's on Lauren Lapkus.

Dang.

Yeah.

And, and pre, the wrong Missy.

Pre-wrong Missy.

Yeah.

Pre-wrong Missy.

Yeah.

Somehow shot.

Um, and here's his pre-wrong Missy.

Uh, we'd love to do it at some point.

You know that Jimmy Pardo and I used to play it all the time.

Uh, to be there.

Yeah.

Like just to test each other on it.

Uh, because we both wanted to do it.

He wanted to host it.

I wanted to do it.

He used to love doing the, uh, dick Clark hand on the shoulder.

Yeah.

Like half massage.

What if I had said, dick to foam?

Dick Buckus, things that people confuse Dick Buckus for.

Dick Buckus.

Wait, what was the thing we did?

Dick Hitch.

What was the thing we did with Mike Ditko?

What movie?

Da room.

Ah.

That seems like a million years ago now.

What about Da marvelous Mrs. Maisel?

Da curious life of Benjamin Button.

Oh, it was a case, right?

A case.

The case of Benjamin Button.

It certainly was a case.

Yes.

It wasn't a life.

Who was keeping track of these cases?

Well, it's all, it was a detective.

Oh, sure.

Yeah.

There's in the expanded button verse you learned that is someone tracking all these people down.

The secret was he got younger to conceal murder.

He murdered someone.

He murdered someone as an old man.

And everyone was looking around for an old man, like, or older.

All I got to do is keep getting younger until I'm in the womb again.

Yep.

How does it end?

I've never seen it.

Weirdly enough, that's the one Finter movie that I do not care for.

By the way, helicopters above us, we're outside.

High helicopter.

Outside in my backyard and about 24 feet apart and not spitting on each other and outside the breeze is taking care of it.

And we have been testing each other every day.

I test you, you test me.

We're a happy family.

I have a question.

Yes, raise your hand.

You said I did.

You.

Paul in the back.

You used the term backyard.

But I think of this as a patio because it's all concrete.

Yeah.

Well, there's a yard right there.

There's a yard behind you.

Sure.

But we're in a concrete part where I feel like we're on the patio.

I guess maybe where I grew up as established previously, Orange County.

We called it.

Previously at Orange County.

We called everything that was behind the house, the backyard.

Hey, man, I hear that.

So no matter what it was, was it the patio was a, I mean, yes, there were subsets of the backyard, but we called everything the backyard.

Hey, I don't care what you are.

Grass concrete polka dot.

Grass on the backyard to me.

Play ball.

What are some of the things that you say that I could make fun of you over?

I don't know.

Let me just keep talking and you can run me like you always do.

Hey, look at a mirror as well.

Look, we have fun.

Speaking of freedom.

Yeah.

Now, do you think anyone's going to yell to them when they see that these are going to be episodes are out because that's what people do to me and Lauren when we post our about real problems.

Really, they just yell to them.

It's a different person every time somebody will post a picture and somebody says to them.

I mean, it's nice, but it does.

It makes me feel, it makes me feel bad.

Like you can't do your own thing without me.

I got it.

Well, that people think we're excluding you.

But aren't you?

Yes.

I don't want people to think it though.

No, I wouldn't do that show on a bet.

So.

No, no one feel bad for me.

You won't even do a live freedom.

I won't.

That was a heart.

That was one of the hardest nose.

We were recording three of it.

Break Lauren said, would you ever want to do a live freedom?

And Scott went, no, live on zoom.

Yes.

We've done.

We did want a Toronto.

Yeah, that was really fun.

That was really fun.

I was kind of nervous about that before we did it.

I trusted that it was going to be okay that it would just kind of naturally fall into place.

Yeah.

And people like such a strange thing to be doing this thing we'd only ever done by ourselves.

Yeah.

And putting in front of an audience and how it would change the dynamic.

And it didn't really.

Didn't really.

Well, I don't necessarily get nervous before anything anymore.

Okay.

I think, I think, no, no, just in my head, I'm usually just like, whatever happens happens, it'll be fine.

But there was a lot of discussion about the chairs.

That's all I remember.

A lot of discussion about the chairs.

Lots of chair discussion.

Yeah.

Where now you're in charge of the chairs for freedom and I'm in charge of the chairs for comedy bank.

Because you hate the chairs on comedy bank.

That's right.

The stools.

Because the show started getting longer and then we're sitting on these fucking wooden bar stools.

And by the way, and I haven't talked about this previously, but on the last tour that we did.

The last tour we did.

I was having really severe knee problems and was in pain during every show.

God damn.

And every time I would jump off the stool in order to go into a scene or whatever we were doing, my knee would buckle and I would, and I would twinge and remember how, how, like some of the green rooms were like flights of stairs up from the stage and I was having and I was like gingerly going down them and all that kind of stuff.

I remember you were like, I'm ginger.

And here I go.

Professor.

I'm the Marianne and the rest.

No, but it was, I was, I was in constant pain during that tour and then I went into physical therapy and my knee got better.

You were just like Ricardo Montabon on Fantasy Island?

Yes.

He had some problems.

Did you say Financers Island?

Yeah, Financers Island.

The magical place where you got to find it.

You're tripped to fantasy island.

All right.

Here's how we're going to do it.

Just you're going to sell some stuff.

And then eat, eat, and eat, and eat.

I mean, and an APR.

This is an insane amount of money fantasy island.

You know what they do there, right?

It's like magic shit.

I think he had back problems.

He had like chronic back problems and he was in pain the whole time he was doing that show.

Right.

Well, like the professional I am, I didn't let any of the audience know and apparently not you, even though I think that you knew.

I probably forgot.

You're playing dumb at this point.

I'm sure you brought up a week of playing about the stools.

Yes.

Did you ever see you see Star Trek to the wrath of Khan?

Have you seen recently?

Of course.

Pretty recently.

Yeah.

He is having a fucking ball in that movie.

Oh, man.

I would love to do any show where I had as much fun as he's had on that show.

He is including this episode now.

You don't think you're having a Ricardo Mottlebahn and Wrath of Khan level of fun doing this?

Yes, they don't know.

But if you have not seen that movie or haven't seen it a long time, check it out because he's ate so much fun to watch him.

It's a tour de force.

It really is.

And, I mean, you watch that movie and you know why they named a theater down the street after him.

Wherever you live, wherever you live, there's one theater down the street for wherever you are.

It's like every place has a Marlouza King, Jr. Boulevard, everybody says Ricardo Mottlebahn Theater.

Well, east of the Mississippi, east of the Mississippi.

It's not the Ricardo Mottlebahn Theater, of course.

It's hardies.

Yes.

It's best foods theater.

We talked about that on the Italiano Jones episode.

Oh, sure.

Gotta talk about it.

We're counting down the top four episodes, Paul.

Yeah, I know.

I can't believe it.

Getting close to the end of 2020.

How do you feel about that?

I mean, good, but also bad.

Do you remember, I think when we take...

My president Nixon.

When we take the Christmas episode last year in 2019, I think people were saying, oh, are you looking like 2019 boy, looking forward to 2020?

Well, what a fire that occurs in a dumpster.

And then I was like, I think 2020 is going to be really bad.

I kind of remember this and everyone's like, why?

Why?

I was like, well, the election is going to be fucking horrible.

And all year leading up to it is going to be dramatic and terrible.

Which it was.

And I didn't even conceive of the pandemic.

Yeah.

And you conceived of it, of course.

You thought it up.

You're welcome, everyone.

But yeah, it exceeded expectations for how horrible it would be.

And it expected excisions.

That's right.

And we read Ephesians.

Oh, the book of Ephesians.

I love it.

One of the best books of the Bible.

What are the Ephesians up to, by the way?

Some books you could just...

And we talked about this on another show.

We should just rewrite the Bible.

Like, there hasn't been a new...

I remember when I was in church in the 70s.

Groovy.

There was...

Yeah, it was Groovy because there was an adaptation of the Bible called The Way, I think.

Oh, that sounds familiar.

It had The Way in that 70s font.

It was written by fastball.

Yes.

But it was in that almost like Jonathan Livingston CEO font.

Yes, yes, yes.

And then there were pictures of young hippies in the letters.

Yeah.

And it was like, this is the hip Bible.

Hey, man.

We're the Ephesians.

And it was a translation or an adaptation of the Bible that did all the verses and everything, but like updated it with hippie language.

It was so ridiculous.

But we should do one ourselves.

We should cut out all the stupid shit.

Have Jesus say, take it, sleazy, catch you on the flip.

And have some new stuff in the Jesus first.

Yeah, yeah.

How about like the apostles are like watching TV and stuff.

Yeah.

They're like watching Netflix and they're chilling.

Sure.

They're Netflix and chilling.

And they invite their boo over.

Yeah, make it real modern.

You know, modern references.

Right.

TikTok.

Um, I would love to spend three years just translating the Bible.

Do you think that TikTok is an adaptation of dig dug?

We talked about that on one of these episodes.

Did we really?

Yes, because I just heard us talking about it.

You and you?

You brought this up.

Someone said no.

Someone said TikTok and you thought they said dig dug.

Okay.

Yes.

I can.

We heard this clip I feel like even I can't remember.

Fuck.

It is really running together.

But scary everybody.

Sorry.

I smell toast.

Good thing I'm making toast.

Boy, that was a close one.

Oh, I'm making toast.

I smell bacon.

I'm also making bacon.

It's breakfast time.

Get on the floor.

Put on your breakfast.

She is the more everybody get that on the floor and eat your breakfast and you snore.

Snore wakes up your head.

Now, the rainy time.

Maybe I do now.

We've lost our minds.

We really have everybody.

By episode four, we have lost our minds because we do this all in one day.

It's wild.

Oh my God.

Didn't we start out just doing an hour?

Yes.

The first best of episode was an hour long.

And how many episodes was it?

10 to 1?

I think we did 10 to 1 and we played like a three minute clip.

That means 1.

In sanity.

And now they're four three hour episodes.

Yeah, I mean, we are in control of that.

I know.

But the clips are so good.

I honestly, there's so many minutes of clips on this particular episode.

There's an hour and 50 minutes of clips on this episode.

I love my mittens.

Mittens.

Yeah, it's winter.

Oh my gosh.

But the clips are so good, I couldn't cut them down any further.

Man, when you got clips just good, you don't want to cut them.

You never want to cut them.

Well, let's get to it.

Let's get to the first clip.

No, I don't need clips.

Top four.

These are the good ones.

Finally.

Finally, we're out there.

All right, let's hear.

This is your episode four.

Number four.

Okay.

Remember the year of September.

Remember the last episode, episode five was episode 649?

Yeah, that's all I remember.

This is episode 650.

One week later?

One week later.

April 13th, smack dab in the middle of the 600s.

That's right.

And it's one of those special, like, not anniversary episodes, but, you know, rounded off.

It's not even the hundreds, but it's 650.

Right.

It seems like a special episode.

So you make a special.

And what do we normally do on the 50s and the 100s?

You get your good old pals, Jason Mansuk and Standy Daley.

That's right.

Well, exception, this is from April 13th.

This is called bun gun and a hot dog bullet.

Bun gun and a hot dog bullet.

Okay.

Bun gun and a hot dog bullet.

So this, this needs a little bit of explanation.

So Jason Mansukas, of course, we've heard him several times on the countdown and Andy Daley.

This is his first appearance this year.

Andy Daley, one of the best improvisers around does all these insanely dark characters.

And the year before on the 10th anniversary episode, which was episode 599, if you must know, Andy was playing the surfer character that he plays hot dog based on my catchphrase, old catchphrase, what's up hot dog that I gave to weirdo.

Yankovic, which he says, he really used it.

He does.

I went to see him at the Greek and he used it there.

So all right.

Yep.

Okay.

How long ago was that?

That was one of his last live shows that he did before the pandemic.

Did he know that you were going to be there?

Oh, I mean, maybe just saying maybe, but not because you have to show up in the guise of a beggar to one of his shows and see if he says, but it's just old lies to make it bubble up.

Exactly.

And you were a cloak, a radio cloak, and you must go in with sandals upon your feet, shoddy sandals.

And I have to beg for the ticket.

Yes, please, please.

Oh, if I don't get in, then you'll never know.

I'll never know.

Of course.

So Andy was playing hot dog and Jason was talking to Jason and I.

And of course, Andy, Andy's character hot dog.

And I think Andy himself loves Sean and a lot of Andy's characters love what he loves.

Do you think that Andy loves Sean?

I know.

He's just kind of fascinated by that.

He knows so much about Sean and a lot that he must love them.

I, okay.

I don't know.

He, he, you ask him off Mike any question about Sean and on.

He knows that so much about them that I, I don't know.

I, I, this is a good question.

We should call him.

I feel like I know a lot about some people that I personally despise.

Yes.

The Proud Boys queuing on.

That's exactly.

Sean on us.

Same thing.

Sean was the Proud Boys of the 50s.

He was the 70s about the 50s.

Here's what people are saying.

Sean on was the Proud Boys of the 70s about the 50s.

It was a different time.

It was the 70s about the 50s.

But everything's the same.

Proud Boys now.

The new Sean on that.

If everyone took them as seriously.

There's a variety show briefly on CBS.

What a better world that would be if everyone just treated them like Sean on that.

Right.

Sean on in Greece.

Oh man.

That's a good question.

I think they were, but I don't know.

They should have been, right?

The country you mean.

Yeah.

They even played Greece before.

Have they ever gone to Greece as a family for Greek week?

Who knows?

So we were talking about Sean on awe.

Every year we've tried to get, well Andy talks in character, talks about how it's a crime that Sean on awe has not been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

And so on that episode, I believe we said that we should create a petition in order to get them in because that's how it's chosen a lot of times now is the fans all start petitions for their favorite acts to get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

So we had a bunch of comedy bang bang listeners start a petition that thousands and thousands of people signed to get Sean on awe into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Oh, and on that episode, we said in a year from now on the 650th episode, when we traditionally do an episode, let's meet and check back in.

We also, you'll hear it, but something was going to happen.

We established if Sean on awe was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

So they were inducted.

If they were inducted.

So cut to a year later, the petition did not work, but we still did the episode and we're catching up with it.

On this episode, Andy plays three characters.

He plays his cowboy poet character Dalton Wilcox.

He plays August Lindt, who is the German pretzel inspector, Sultan Spector.

Sorry.

And we just talked about that last week.

And he also plays the aforementioned hot dog.

This is bonkers.

Let's hear it.

This is your episode four.

Number four.

It's great to see you.

The bro down, ho down continues to pay.

So we are going to be doing this all the entire show.

Thank you, sir.

Don't.

Did you talk?

What?

Who?

Don't Wilcox, you goddamn city slickers.

Jesus Christ.

Yeah.

Wait a minute.

This is.

Barreling through the door.

That's right, I did.

Sorry, Dalton.

Where in the middle of a bro down, ho down?

We're on hour one of an uninterrupted seven hour podcast.

Gentlemen, I've been to a lot of ho downs in my time and this is no goddamn ho down.

Oh, interesting.

No, but have you been to a bro down?

I don't know what that is.

And I don't want to know.

I'm full up knowing stuff.

You are fired.

Yeah, man.

Hold on.

You're not knowing.

You don't want to know anything else for the end of your till the end of your life.

That's precisely right.

I am full up knowing things.

So are you not reading anything or watching any kind of informational television?

Never in hell.

Even trivia like TV trivia?

I know all the trivia I need to know.

Go ahead and test me.

Okay.

If the professor on Gilligan's eyelids could make all those inventions, why couldn't he make a boat?

Well, that's not trivia.

That's not trivia.

That's complaining.

That's not trivia.

Oh, aren't you so serious?

It's smart that you can point out the plot holes in Gilligan's island?

Yeah, ridiculous.

If Mike Brady was such a great architect.

This again is not going to be trivia.

It has to be something, a fact that was established on a television program.

You nailed me about that.

He aren't just because of Rule of Three's.

He has to do one more thing that proves that he was a child in the seven.

I understand.

Go ahead.

On Gilligan's island when they say, and the rest, who were the rest?

And the rest.

The rest was Mary Ann.

And the professor.

Well, they changed the lyrics midway through.

They added them.

From Ann, the rest to the professor.

And Mary Ann.

How do you feel if you're the professor of Mary Ann and you get Ann, the rest status?

Well, they were fucking furious.

And that's why they had to go change the damn song.

I'm sure it was, you know, like contractual, you know, like they were probably.

Do you think so that they filmed, you know, 50 episodes of it, then suddenly it started to air and they're like, what the fuck is this?

They had never seen that they're.

Well, yep, that's exactly what happened.

They went 50 episodes.

You think they shot two years before they realized they weren't in the...

I don't have television used to work in those days.

You would shoot 50 episodes before the first one premiered and hope it did well because you're in the hole millions of dollars.

Is that what happened with Bonanza?

I know you're a big Bonanza head.

Not only am I a big Bonanza head, but I love Bonanza.

That show...

I think that's what being a big Bonanza head means.

That's 431 episodes.

And they shot 200 of them before they even premiered the first one.

Wow.

Because they knew it was going to be a barn burner.

So that was on the air for 10 years or so, was it not?

I don't know years.

I know numbers of episodes.

You don't know years.

I don't know.

Let me throw one out of you.

Show.

Okay, right.

1963.

I'll take your word for it, but that was a year.

Yeah.

I don't know.

Sure.

Sounds like...

I've heard, yeah.

Can you understand a year as a measurement of time?

Well, yes I do.

And funny you should say that because I was hearing this goddamn chair one year ago today.

Wait, really?

Roundabout sorta.

Sure.

Yeah, that's right.

Wait a minute.

The first time I was on episode 600, which...

No, no, no.

I'm saying episode 599.

No, y'all were having your 10 anniversary.

10th anniversary episode 599.

Yeah.

So 51 episodes ago, a true mid-hondo.

And yeah, and I forget what we talked about.

You do?

I certainly do.

You do?

Wow.

That makes me mad on top of mad.

Wow.

I was given an assignment when I left here last time, goddamn it, and it was a hard fucking assignment.

Well, hold on.

Yeah, by you, goddamn it.

Let's recap what happened the last time you're here because I don't even remember booking you.

I think that...

Oh, that's right.

Why aren't we talking to our friend Hot Dog initially?

Oh yeah.

That's exactly what I...

Good guy.

He came in suddenly because we were talking about the catchphrase.

What's up?

Don't say it!

I said it very quietly though.

Don't say it.

He shows up.

Oh, that's right.

And wait, it's because...

I'm not ready for him to show up.

I have to explain.

I have to say things and showing up, we said your name for whatever reason and you appeared.

I know you conjured me last time.

This time I came here I'm on power.

I can't believe you guys don't remember what the mission you sent me on a year ago was.

It was literally to save the goddamn world and the human race!

You got suddenly...

Haven't you done that already?

It seems to be ringing a kind of a bell.

What a...

The mission was that there's son of a bitch who's named after a food that you'd eat at a weenie roast and I'm not going to say it's no I don't conjure him.

Oh, okay, sorry.

He had a plan.

He was going to get some rock and roll band to inducted into the rock and roll hall of faith.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

Oh yeah, the thing that was supposed to be yesterday.

Shanna, he wanted to get...

Shanna inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame.

We signed a petition for that.

I think we might have championed that for a while.

Yeah, that's right.

That's a fucking mistake because it turns out that Shanna and I had prophesied the whole entire rock and roll hall of fame.

And if they got inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame, all of their songs was going to come true and it was going to destroy the world!

Oh right!

This is not ringing any...

I believe you.

Yeah.

It's not ringing any bell.

It's shocking to me that you could forget this.

Well, I think I sort of remember we were talking to that guy.

And HD.

HD, of course, yeah, HD Wells.

High definition.

Yeah.

And we were trying to get Shanna into the rock and roll hall of fame this year for 2020 because they were not inducted in 2019.

And we said a year ago that we were going to try to get them inducted.

And then we had some sort of side conversation about where if they were to stand upon the stage at the rock and roll hall of fame and sing that something would happen.

Yeah.

All of their goddamn songs would come true.

Including Earth Angel.

We would all be...

Angels would come to Earth.

Oh, we were...

We angels would come to Earth?

And yeah.

Oh, that's hot.

Everyone would die and become an angel.

Right.

And would all be teen angels.

We'd be teeny.

And everyone would get a job.

Everyone would get a job.

Meeting being slaved by Satan or something like that.

That's exactly what that means.

I'm going to worry about these teen angels.

Children would be born to hand jive.

The moon would turn blue.

Blue moon.

Oh no.

Thank you for explaining.

Oh no.

No problem.

There would be skeletons walking around.

Boney Maronis.

Oh no.

Yeah.

It would be terrible.

And of course, God only...

I even hate to say it, but that purple people leader would be...

That would exist.

Yeah.

Be running a muck.

Literally eating people.

And we would also find out who wrote the book of love.

Oh, that's right.

The book of love is...

You don't want to know who wrote the book.

That is...

The fiery book of love.

That's the answer to that.

Yeah.

Not only did you tell me I had to kill this goddamn hot dog guy to stop him from getting shot on on stage.

He told him.

Yes, you did.

But you told me that I...

That doesn't sound like a...

I specifically had to kill him with a bullet made out of a hot dog, shot out of a gun, made out of a bun.

Oh, right.

Now that sounds interesting.

Were you able to do that?

This has been the most pain in the ass year of my life.

That sounds...

I'll be honest.

That sounds impossible.

Did we ask you to construct these things or to find them if they already go?

That's a...

You did not even specify.

And in a way I wish you had at least given me some direction to go on.

That's like an episode of Forged in Fire where they give men like crazy...

Tasks, yeah.

And they force them to make swords out of them.

Right, yeah.

We gave you a hot dog bun and said, make a gun out of this?

Well, you just didn't give me the bun.

You just told me it's got to be a bullet made out of a hot dog.

A hot dog bullet and a bun gun.

Yeah, a bun gun.

Bun gun.

Yeah.

Well...

So you obviously were unable to do this, right?

Incorrect.

What?

I contacted.

I was...

I did a little snooping around and I found out about a German guy in Dusseldorf, Germany works at a personal factory.

Whoa, why do you have to snoop?

Couldn't you just have like asked around?

No, you got to snoop.

You don't...

Could you don't want anybody to know what you're up to?

Okay.

People aren't going to ask questions.

Are you talking about August Lindt?

Who?

Yeah, that's a fella's name.

Oh, wait, I remember him.

Well, I brought him here.

He's outside because I didn't know how to explain the science.

You know what I'm in?

You've been a horrible...

You've been on this rock for...

People with you?

Well, I brought August.

Yeah, I brought it because he's...

Jesus, alright.

He's been on the show before bringing him in here.

I'd like to talk to you.

Oh, really?

Alright, hang on.

Yeah, I'd like to say...

Yeah, get out of here.

August Lindt, of course.

You know what's quite...

It's kind of nice that Tolden Wilcox has like made friends.

Oh, yeah.

He's reaching out to me, but he's alone.

He's like, I wouldn't consider us friends.

Hello!

August Lindt, you guys.

So great to see you again.

August Lindt, yeah.

It's wonderful to be here.

Luckily I was on vacation, so it was not to be here to come and see you guys.

Is the coronavirus disrupting your vacation at all?

It's where Darlene just told me he killed it.

So that's really good.

Okay, that's why you're over here.

But, no, I have been over the past few months.

I have been a coronavirus tourist.

Do you know about this...

The coronavirus?

The coronatorism?

I guess.

You're going to places where you think they...

I'm just going to the real coronavirus hotspots and starting out in Wuhan.

Sure.

And then it's been all about Italy.

I've had a wonderful time.

I don't think you should be here, man.

Well, if you're... why?

Because you're afraid I have this thing?

Yeah, obviously.

Honestly, if you're going from hotspot to hotspot, that's not good.

I have what's known as a supercase.

Oh, no.

Supercase.

Like an exacerbated, intense concentrated dose of this?

Yeah, that's right.

So...

That's bad.

Yeah, but it's fine.

Oh, it's fine.

Oh, it sounds like it's fine.

It's fine.

I have been...

Listen, over the course of my life, I have been to so many disease areas.

And I have been...

Is this a hobby for you?

Oh, I just... it's just... I like to go on vacation to an interesting place.

Some people go to, like, sites of famous battles or things like for you.

Well, obviously, I'll just have it.

You've always been going to dangerous places and trying to...

Well, you know, I just like to... you know, the issue is that I always have a wonderful time on vacation.

And so my boss, Mr. Schmeiderberg at Schmeiderberg-Pretzels, has sort of challenged me to try to go to someplace that I would not like.

And it hasn't happened yet.

Has it?

You like me?

Yeah.

And Germany famously has, like, so many weeks of vacation.

Well, not at the Schmeiderberg-Pretzels.

We only get about this.

Yeah, I think we're only going to get about in ten months of vacation.

It's so terrible.

And what do you do with the pretzel factory again?

You're the guy who's...

I am a salt inspector.

You inspect the science.

You don't inspect the salt.

You don't put it on the pretzels.

Are you kidding me?

No.

What is this?

You inspect the salt before or after or both.

Before or after what?

It's put on the pretzel.

Oh, before.

Yeah.

Once it's put on the pretzel tails, no further inspection of the salt, it is considered to be pretzel verity salt.

Okay.

So you're inspecting it before?

No.

Because I thought there was a situation where the pretzels come one at a time.

And there was a...

Yeah, of course they do.

And there was a someone in the booth, like a dummy or something like that.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

What exactly is it?

We don't have to remember mythology.

I don't remember all of this.

It's been a while since I've been to the office.

But yeah, that's something...

So every time you come back after your ten months vacation, you have to refresh your memory about it.

I don't remember who works.

I go back through training after vacations.

I'm just training less.

Like training?

Six weeks.

Yeah, six weeks.

And then I'm on a job for usually like two weeks.

And then it's back on vacation.

Look, the point is that I was able to make a hot dog bullet and a barn gun.

You were able to do this hot dog.

It was very difficult because a hot dog doesn't want to be a bullet.

No, a hot dog is primarily a...

I don't know why I'm explaining the concept of hot dog.

Everybody knows really well.

Where did you start with the bullet or the gun?

I started with the bullet because I thought, what's the point to have the gun if you can't fire the bullet.

There's no bullet.

So a hot dog does not want to be a bullet.

It wants to sort of...

It wants to disintegrate, I would imagine, and be...

Hot dogs want to be eaten.

Yes!

And then if the barn gun was actually not that hard.

Really good.

That seems to me like it would be the hard one.

No, the barn gun was easy.

I don't think I could make a gun if you paid me a million dollars.

I think there has to be like a hammer and...

If I had a 3D printer and could get some plans off the internet, maybe I could make a gun?

Hang on, guy.

The trick was just to get to a barn with no preservatives and let it go stale and put a trigger on it.

And that was really it.

Oh shit!

That was what it took.

Yeah, it works fine.

It's a trigger?

Yeah, you've got to put a trigger on it.

What's the trigger?

Next you do.

The trigger.

The barn!

So is that easy?

That was really easy.

I guess put a trigger on anything.

You could be a good trigger on it.

Yeah.

Well, great to see you.

No, we've got to do this thing!

What are we doing?

We've got to kill hot dog and...

You keep singing his name.

Well, you've got to say...

If you want to conjure him, you've got to say it about 11 or 12 times.

No, you've got to ask him what's...

Ohh!

The old catchphrase.

Yeah.

Okay, before we do it though, we need a plan.

What are we doing?

Alright, when he comes in here, I'm going to hide in that closet.

Okay.

With Dalton Wilcox and this can be...

Your Dalton Wilcox.

That's what I mean.

It's going to be...

What about August lint?

Me Dalton Wilcox, August lint.

And this can of refried beans.

I'm going to go hide in that closet.

That can be...

That can be open and obviously drunk.

August, you may not want to go into that closet.

No, I've...

Listen, I've seen it a few times already.

Okay.

So you're going to go in the closet and then we're going to summon a hot dog and then...

I'm going to...

Time is right.

I'm going to burst out of that closet.

When the time is right, this is the part where the plan gets a little vague for me.

What are we supposed to do?

You just keep him busy.

Keep him busy.

You see.

Because it takes a little while to get the fish, the hot dog bullet out of the dry house.

Do it now!

Before you go in.

Get ready now!

He's not here yet.

If he walks in here and I'm sitting here, he's going to turn around and walk right out.

Listen to me.

One of us at some point is going to say, what's up hot dog?

Uh oh.

Dude, it's...

Oh, Jason, you did it to me.

Fuck!

Hey, what's going on you guys?

It's me, hot dog.

Hey, hot dog.

How's it going?

Great to see you man.

Who's running into that closet?

Oh, that's the janitor here at the studio.

Yeah, that's the janitor's closet.

There's two of them.

There's two people running into the...

And the can of beans.

Yeah, it's three different paychecks.

Yeah.

But yeah, they work as a team.

They work as a team.

Three different appearances.

It's great to be here you guys.

It's great to see you.

I'm a real, real busy man.

I'm a busy, busy, busy year.

What's going on in the world?

We talked to you about a year ago.

Well, you know, I've been busy trying to get shot on on to the rock and roll hall.

We talked about that last time you were here.

Yeah, it didn't happen for 2019 and you were upset about that.

And we were going to try to see if they could get on in 2020.

Right.

Yeah, but anyway, so the...

I have managed to get shanana into the rock and roll hall of fame through the hardest possible way of doing it.

But it had...

This was the only way to do it.

I had a hunch that the doobie brothers were going to be inducted.

And so over the course...

Yeah.

It did happen.

Yeah.

Over the course of this year, I have one by one replaced every member of the doobie brothers with a member of shanana.

What?

Slowly so that no one would notice.

How did you do this?

Well, I started off with Jeff Baxter of the doobie brothers.

Well, that's... yeah, he's easy picking.

Yes, Max!

Nobody pays attention to Jeff Baxter.

I replaced him with Donnie York and it went just fine.

No, but none of the other doobies noticed.

They just went out there.

I mean, luckily these two bands have the exact same number of members and it's a lot of members.

Ooh, they follow the money.

It all adds up.

And what did you do with Baxter?

Well, he... all of these guys, all of the doobie brothers are in a dungeon in the shanana.

Okay, so they're still alive.

So they haven't swapped them.

Like the doobies aren't currently touring as shanana.

Oh, that would be people would be furious.

That's a complete swap.

People would be furious if they came to a shanana.

I didn't know this was a life-swap or not.

If people came to a shanana show and it turned out to be the doobie brothers, they would be fucking furious.

Right.

So the doobie brothers, they've had a busy year because I...

No, I mean, shanana, they haven't carried on as shanana and as the doobie brothers.

It's been difficult.

They've been doing double shows.

So it's very difficult because, you know, some...

Well, sometimes a casino will have two rooms and they'll play them both.

But actually, also the doobies, back-stared notoriously hate doo-op music.

Oh, I know.

Well, so he had to pretend...

Donnie York had to pretend to hate doo-op music.

Very difficult.

Then we...

Yorkie, we swapped John Hartman for Jean-Germilo.

Okay.

We swapped Tom Johnson for Jocko.

These are pretty much even swaps here.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I wouldn't be disappointed either way to see either of these bits.

That's right.

Keith Knudson, we swapped for downtown Michael Brown.

Okay.

Michael McDonald, of course.

This is the hard one.

Yeah, Michael McDonald.

Well, that's rockin' Randy.

Okay.

Solid swab.

They seem to have different kinds of voices, though.

I don't know.

But it's straight...

Yes.

When you go see the doobie brothers, how does Ronald...

Michael McDonald has such an iconic voice.

He's got...

Yeah, I know.

But this is the thing.

Nobody suspects that this is gonna happen.

Like, if you had some clue that maybe somebody has been one by one swapping out the members of the doobie brothers with the shanana, now you would notice.

But nobody thinks that nobody's...

No one would...

Yeah, no one would expect this to happen.

Right, but it's just...

People who listen to this podcast, I mean, admittedly, like, the couple hundred people that do, they would find out by you telling them right now.

No, but it doesn't matter because this podcast is coming out after the...

After the...

The secret inductions ceremony in the catacombs of the rock and roll hall of fame.

Right.

John McPhee swapped him out with Screamin' Scott Simon.

Oh, of course, yeah.

Tyran Porter swapped him out with Tim Butter.

By the way, this is already more members than I thought it would be.

Right.

It is a lot of members.

But Patrick Simmons, of course, you know we had to swap him out with Ty Cox.

That's not a completely equal swap, but I get it.

Yeah, but it's the one that makes the most sense.

That's so cool.

Thanks for popping by, huh?

Ty, I got it, dude.

Son of a bitch.

Whoa!

We had no idea that this guy was here.

I'll be honest, I forgot Dalton was here.

That's gotta be the janitor.

What?

Hotdog?

What, yeah?

Get ready for what?

For your end, my friend.

For the end of your life, hotdog.

What's up, hotdog?

Your death, hotdog.

What are you talking about?

About what's down.

Yeah.

Hotdog as in six feet under.

Yeah.

You guys tried to chat me, I'm gonna get killed today.

We're just keeping you busy.

These were our instructions.

He's clearly trying to fumble putting this hotdog bullet.

He hasn't even taken it out of the dry ice yet.

Well, probably this is very fucking cold under fingers.

Well, yeah, we're those gloves.

We're those gloves.

I told him he should put the gloves on.

He says that they're too feminine.

What have you guys learned?

Oh, God, Dalton Wilcox, August Lindt, this is hotdog.

Yeah, and you're, listen, you son of a bitch.

This is a hotdog bullet, and now I'm gonna shoot it at this bun right at your heart.

Here we go, ready?

I am present to trigger all the hotdog done right now.

It was very quiet.

It's almost like if you put a trigger on a bun, it's like a silencer.

The bun sort of cushions the sound.

It absorbs the sound.

But he did shoot him.

Well, guys, yeah, there's definitely a hotdog fragment in my heart.

Yeah, he got it.

I think I was getting to the point that you were lying about moving your heart, right?

That was in order to throw him off the...

No, I didn't.

I moved it slightly.

Had moved at 16 millimeters.

Why?

Well, that's not enough.

You can't move a heart that much.

It still has a function like a heart.

I think it was hard enough to find a doctor to do that.

Especially someone who is like competing at the high level you are physically.

Where did you get this procedure done?

Was that on a boat somewhere?

Yeah, it was on a boat way out on international waters.

Well, that's right.

We're the laws don't apply.

Who performed?

What doctor did you find?

Well, I don't know if he was necessarily really a doctor.

Was he wearing snakeskin pants?

Oh my God.

Well, he was dressed head to toe and snakeskin.

Oh, no.

He did a friend of ours from the Arklight.

Pasadena.

Oh, really?

Hotdog.

Are you...

Are you a man?

I can feel the life draining.

Oh, no.

I just want to tell you that we had no choice.

Yeah, sorry that we had to align ourselves with Dalton Wilcox here in August Lind, who...

But unfortunately, we want to remain alive past tonight.

I get it.

I understand.

By the way, Hotdog, before you expire, I did want to ask you...

Are you the guy who wanted your body to be turned into Hotdogs, right?

Oh, yeah.

Well, this August...

Oh, but this is very convenient.

August is the guy that you have the contract with.

Yeah, that's great.

I'll bring your body back to Germany and take care of it there.

This works out great.

This is a very convenient...

And you still want your penis to be served to make Mitt Romney, right?

I want most of my body to be served to the members of Sean Anau, and that I do specifically want my penis to serve Mitt Romney.

I don't remember why.

I don't remember why either, but it was something...

Oh, that's because Hotdog was his favorite meat.

Yes, I believe so.

Oh, he said that Hotdog was his favorite meat.

Yeah.

Well, we're going to find out if he really means it when he eats my penis off.

What a solid prank.

Number four.

And that's just...

It continues on from there, and I'll leave the end of the episode for you to listen to, but that's...

That is just the tip of the nutsburg.

That's right.

Just the tip of the nutsburg.

All right, let's take a break.

We'll come back.

We'll do number three.

Very quickly about Sean Anau.

I saw a clip of them, like old studio footage of them...

It was an old studio and new footage?

Or old studio and old footage.

Oh, okay, great.

But they were very young.

It was in the year they taped it.

It was an old studio, so now it's even older?

Exactly.

It's probably not even there anymore.

It probably died.

Okay.

But they are covering these old do-op songs, but they're doing them with this breakneck pace, and they look like punks.

It's like they were almost doing a pogues thing before the pogs did of taking this old music and f***ing speeding it up.

But it's really wild to see.

They're not wearing 1950s outfits.

They look like f***ing pogs.

And then they just leaned into the whole 50s of it because 50s nostalgia was really big.

Hey, remember how we were doing something different with this?

Let's not.

Let's do the same with it.

I'll try to find that clip and put it online when this goes out.

Oh, I'd love that.

Yeah.

All right, let's take a break.

You said it up a bit.

All right, so we'll take a break.

We'll be right back.

Comedy Bang Bang, we're back here.

Paul of Tomkins, best of part four.

This is the top three we're getting to.

Wow.

Now, Scott, before we go any further with the countdown, there's something I have to do.

Okay, what's that?

Well, he's walking closer to me, and he's putting a thing.

He's moved a, he's moved a, an end table further away from him, but closer to me, but now I know we have to be careful because of the times we're living in.

Okay.

But I brought a friend with me.

Oh, and I hope you won't mind.

I don't mind at all a little friend.

Oh, it's the, what did we call him?

The frosty guy who sings in points, right?

He's a snowman.

Right.

Of course, we have the snowman game, right, where the snowman sings, let it know, right?

And then dances around and whomever the, you hope that he will look at you.

And because if he looks at you, it's incredibly validating.

Right.

Yes.

At the end of the song, he stops and looks at someone.

He looks at, he looks at, he stops various points.

Right.

You always want him to look at you.

Oh.

And if when his song is over and he's looking at you, that's just, oh, that's the nuts.

That's those nuts.

That's the nuts.

That's flush.

All right.

So are you ready?

I am going to start him up.

Why did you put it so far away from yourself?

Cause that's, that thing is heavy or just makes it more dramatic.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

It's closer to me.

All right.

Here we go.

It's just you're so far away from the mic and I have to eat up all the time.

It's okay.

He started.

He's dancing.

We can't hear exactly.

I'm going to turn this up though.

Oh, he'd almost looked at me, but he didn't.

He's seeing him let it snow.

He's twirling around.

Now he's looking at the squirrel and he's twirling around again.

And now he's looking at one more turn.

He's got one more turn.

He's got one more turn and he comes and he's, oh, well, unfortunately he looked at my neighbors property.

Yeah.

Those creeps.

They're getting good luck.

Huh?

Yeah.

You like what you say?

You got a shit you like?

Well that was exciting.

We'll play another round.

We'll play another round right now.

Okay.

Yeah.

Let's keep on keeping on.

All right.

Let's do it.

This is the next.

We're in the top three crazy.

This is the episode that you have voted for.

This is your episode three.

Number three.

All right.

Episode three.

Number 643.

Yeah.

This is from March 2nd.

March 2nd.

Now this should give you a clue as to what happened just two days before.

Two days before was the end of February.

Right.

And everyone was like, oh, thank God.

But what happened?

What was the date two days before if you had to guess?

Well, I have two choices.

Yep.

I'm going to go for the weird choice because I like to think outside the jack and the butt.

I'm going to say it was February 29th.

Yes, it was because this is a leap year.

Yeah.

Does that give you an idea of what episode this is?

No.

Oh, okay.

Well, it should.

This is an episode called the order of the keepers.

The order of the keepers.

That was this year.

Wow.

It's so it feels so I was listening to this clip.

It was feels so long ago and yet it was just this last March 2nd when we dropped it.

We were different people.

Truly was.

This is in the studio and this.

Let's talk about this because it's it.

This is one of the benefits of doing the the podcast over for over a decade now because you can do things like this.

So four years ago, four or five years ago, Neil Campbell, who is the other participant on this.

Yeah.

This is my self.

Paul of Tomkins and Neil Campbell.

Neil Campbell, he was the head writer for the comedy bang bang television show.

Really funny.

Improviser.

He's in the improvised group.

He's in last day of school.

Is his group and currently he's a producer on Brooklyn nine nine and directed a few episodes.

Really funny guy.

But four years ago, he started doing a character called the time keeper and Maxwell keeper who was fascinated with time.

Inexplicable as to why it was funny.

It's something only Neil could have come up with.

It's true.

He pitched me the idea.

I was like, okay, I mean, he didn't pitch a bit.

He said, this is what I'm going to do.

And he doesn't have any sort of magical powers.

No, all he he comes.

He comes in with a voice like this where you think it's going to be a guy with magical powers.

And he wears a cloak with star field lining.

The cloak of star field lining.

But he's just a guy who works at his brother in love's watch shop.

Watch repair shop.

He loves time anything to do with time.

So the character became a fan favorite.

And that when we talked about Neil Campbell killing in front of his parents, that was in Boston.

It was unbelievable.

He has one of the best like final lines.

Of the show.

Anyway, so four years ago before Neil got busy doing Brooklyn nine nine, he would do the show a lot more and leap day was coming up in 2016 February 29th.

And he had I think in previous appearances have been talking about how what a wonderful day that was because extra time because it was extra time.

If you're a time based character, you got a lovely.

So when leap year was coming up, we said, okay, let's do an episode with the timekeeper.

And so he brought in a bunch of improvisers who were doing the timeies association.

I think they were called the timeies, whereas all people who love time.

And they did a funny episode.

And then we left and went home.

And then I think Neil called me up and said, Hey, at the end of the episode, should we do a Marvel style tag?

You know, how in the Marvel movies at the end of Iron Man, Nick Fury comes in recruits Iron Man to be part of the Avengers initiative.

And he goes, well, could we get Paul F to be his JW still water character?

Who was Neil's idea?

This is Neil's idea.

Oh, I didn't know that.

And tell us about JW still water.

JW still water is a vigilante hero from Cumberbatch County, Florida.

He is a guy who by day is a fan boat mechanic.

And by night is a vigilante hero patrolling the swamps of this very tiny area because the police are all corrupt.

Right.

Which by the way, recently I was watching Clone Wars and I saw a job of the huts brother or nephew or whatever.

And he travels around on a laser powered fan boat.

And so I had to take it.

And he has southern accent.

He talks like Truman Capote.

And I was like, that's weird that the Star Wars franchise allowed the voice over artist to basically just do Truman Capote.

Yeah.

Like it seems like the voice over artist is kind of like sneaking one in there.

And so I read about it.

And no, it was he originally talked in hoodies like Jabba until George Lucas said, I think it'd be funny if he talked like Truman Capote.

He'll be like, so then he got out of the hole.

His entire family has southern accents.

He goes and talks to his mom.

She's like in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.

And hey, here's that plane.

It's back.

What do you think you forgot?

His bowls in the living room.

Oh, come on.

Living room bowls.

So in any case, Neil wanted your JW Stillwater character because he's one of the superheroes in the comedy Van Bien universe to come recruit you into something called the Order of the Keepers.

Right.

And I can't remember if you guys were even together when we taped it or you did your parts separately.

I feel like we might have done a separate thing.

You did separately where Neil was like, oh, who's this?

And then we taped you a week later coming in and saying, you know, I want to recruit you into the Order of the Keepers.

I want to record you.

We had no, that's a good impression of data.

That's what he sounds like.

Hey, I got out.

We had no plan to follow it up.

Neil didn't have any idea to follow it up.

We never spoke of it again.

Never spoke of it again.

But in the back of my head, I was like, if we're still doing the show four years later, let's try to do that on leap day again.

And so as it approached, I reached out to Neil and said, hey, should we do this?

And he was game and I reached out to you and you were game.

And we did this episode where we were following up on you and recruiting him into the Order of the Keepers.

None of us knew what to talk about or how it was going to go.

But I listened to this clip and we're all going to hear this clip.

But it's just one of the one of those great episodes where like the three of us are having so much fun.

Yeah.

So we're going to hear.

We're going to hear it now.

This is Neil Campbell doing the timekeeper and then JW Stillwater comes in.

This is your episode three.

Number three.

Remind me exactly the last time you were on the show.

I believe you were it was around your birthday.

Yes.

Leap day.

Leap day is your birthday February 29th.

Yes, I turned 32 now 36.

Okay.

So you are 36 and you don't celebrate the ones in between.

Okay.

You can say no or you.

Nay.

Okay.

So you are now 36.

You just had a birthday.

It's true.

So you have a couple of news.

How did you celebrate?

I looked at time all day.

Every clock I could see digital clocks.

How many could you see?

I ran up and down the street house to house knocking on doors.

I said, can I look at every clock in your thine house and do let you in.

How many people?

Just two.

My old babysitter let me in.

Okay.

It's two more than I thought would let you in.

Yes.

So your old babysitter.

No, okay.

Thank you.

Mr. Schwarzenegger.

So that sounds like a wonderful way to spend the day.

It was a wonderful time.

For those of you who don't know Maxwell Keeper, describe your deal.

Oh, gladly.

I love and celebrate time.

That's all.

Short and succinct.

Yes.

I love time.

My brother in law Desmond Longo runs Longo Watch Repair in Tallahassee, Florida.

And I work there as an intern calling people when they have their watch in.

I'll call them every 10 minutes and let them know what time it is.

Right.

Because they don't have a watch.

They don't have a watch.

So they need to know what time it is.

And why are you not just staying on the line with them and counting down the seconds?

Why is it every- I have a lot of calls to make.

I hang up and I call someone else.

You stagger them then?

Yes.

How many watches are much staggering about how many watches are under repair at any given time?

Oh, your eyes just lit up again.

I was thinking, well, they lit up and then they started to feel tears thinking of those broken watches.

But Desmond fixes them post-haste.

Certainly.

But how many are there under repair?

Oh, roughly 17 at any given time.

17, so you're not calling everyone on the 10s.

Exactly.

Are you staggering it so that you call one of the people when it's like 10, 10?

Yes, it depends on what time they dropped it off.

Oh, really?

Yes, it begins 10 minutes to the minute.

To the minute.

After they drop it off.

So some people maybe drop it off at 10, 10 and some people drop it off at 10, 20 in the morning.

So you're calling those people on the 10s.

Back to back.

Yeah.

Right.

That's a nice little baby.

Okay.

Just like Jeremy Piven.

Do you sing, does he sing Jeremy Piven?

Does he sing?

I don't know.

Does he sing Jeremy Piven?

This one's escaping me.

His brother in law is a famous person too though.

Who's that?

To whom is he married?

Oh, I was thinking his dad Adam McKay.

Oh, okay.

I know there's some sort of familial connection there.

I think I don't know.

Maybe I should have.

Hey, speculate.

Look, you know, I'm not a prospect.

No, you are.

You are very good at time related issues.

Maybe not so much of the entertainment trip.

Well, that's kind of what I've been getting into lately though.

What does that mean?

So we've covered though, you work for your brother.

Oh, yes.

Four years ago.

He pays you.

Wonderful amount of time.

No, I'm unpaid.

Four years ago, an organization had recruited me.

The Timies.

Right.

That's the last time we talked to you on your birthday.

The Timies.

Yes.

They turned out that they just wanted money.

They thought time was money.

I rejected time.

I'm happy to say I'm back.

You're back, baby.

I'm back.

You like time again.

I like time and I'm working for a special interest group.

Oh, okay.

This is very interesting.

We're talking K Street.

Wow.

In Washington DC.

Yeah.

Right there.

It's a K and clock.

That's what I always say.

Now you're not talking about a misspelling clock to where it starts with a K. You're talking about the K at the end of clock.

Yes.

Very good.

You can't spell clock without two C's.

Can you?

Mm-mm.

Now, or one CC, I guess.

Oh.

Further all the people in the medical profession.

Mm-mm.

Do you worry about that band 10 CC's?

I haven't listened to Nari a tune of this.

The things we do for love?

You also, you don't have a girlfriend or anything like that.

They, they.

Right.

Were you dating anyone I can't recall?

I had a crush on Lisa Porsche.

Oh, that's right.

Lisa Porsche.

But she was murdered.

They don't remember this.

No, it happened in the last four years.

Oh, she was murdered in the last four years?

Yes, yes.

What happened?

Not by you.

No, no, nay.

I was saddened by it.

Oh, they was mysterious.

By whom was she murdered?

We don't know.

She just passed away one night.

But you said murdered.

I mean, you can't say she just passed away.

Well, sure, there was a knife in her chest.

All right.

Well.

I never really, you know, I just had a crush on her.

You had a crush on her.

You didn't keep up with her.

No.

Yeah, okay.

So now you're working for, are you working out of DC?

I call them and say, what's Kate Street want me to do today?

That's every single day.

Is that every 10 minutes as well?

I fit that in between the other calls.

Okay.

And so I, and so I'm working for a special interest group.

We're trying to raise awareness of time.

We like it's an election year.

It's a year of a census as well.

Yes, we love that people say the word year a lot.

Right.

Okay, so that's very good.

That's big for us.

Were you excited when the new year rolled around and it was 2020 and you knew every week there'd be an advertisement for the year?

Yes, yes.

We on ABC on Thursday.

Exactly.

That's still on?

Yes.

A few downs as hologram hosted.

So you are trying to spread awareness of the concept of time.

Yes.

And then you're trying to get them to put mentions of time in their works or to bring it up on the debate stage with candidates.

You know, you don't see a lot of, I guess every script potentially has a ticking clock element at the end where like the protagonist needs to achieve something in a certain amount of time.

Yes.

But you don't see a lot of characters in movies or television like looking at their watches, glancing at their watches.

Right.

Well, and also if you ever see a rough cut of a film, they have the time code on it.

But by the time they get released, it's not on any, the print anymore.

How do you know that?

Have you seen rough cuts of films?

Yes.

They showed me in the, in our offices in our secret theater.

They said, look at this.

You need to go out to Hollywood and meet with all the studio execs and say, keep the time code on the print when you release the film.

So I've been pushing for that.

You've been pushing for people to release the time code.

Release the time code.

But I, you know, I met with Tarantino who's finishing up a film.

Oh, he is really.

He was.

No, this was over the last four years.

Oh.

He was going to call it those misbehaving mansions.

And I said, well, you should put the word time in the title.

And how did he take that?

I mean, I, I don't know that he tends to listen to a lot of people trying to, he kissed me on the lips and said, thank you.

I will.

How?

He said, I called it once upon a time in Hollywood.

Oh, and you know what?

He even sort of highlighted that word time by putting an ellipsis.

Yes.

Right after it in order to separate it.

Exactly.

From the rest of the title.

They were going to call the upcoming film Wonder Woman Two.

I said, put a year at the end of it.

Okay.

So 1984 is right.

Okay.

Getting all the time out.

Wow.

You've been successful in those two endeavors.

Yeah, it's a Justin Bieber golden beat with Dan and Shag and make it make a song about a length of time.

Any amount will do.

And I don't recall what that 10,000 hours, 10,000 hours.

I mean, that's, I mean, I mean, it's either feast or famine with time sometimes.

And if you're looking at 10,000 hours, I mean, your eyes must be bigger than their stomach.

He's true indeed.

Do I hear a secret?

Do I want to hear a secret?

That's a good question.

This is real insider stuff.

I guess I want to hear a secret.

Sure.

Yeah.

Good.

Hit me.

What do you got?

You're Malcolm Gladwell.

Sure.

It takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something.

Of course.

Do you think he took 10,000 hours in order to become an expert on being an expert?

Yes.

Great.

It actually is 10,007 hours.

What?

We did the math.

10,007.

Yes.

If you do something old me for 10,000 hours, you won't be an expert.

You have to do seven more hours.

Do you think he was rounding down?

I think so to sell units.

I mean, I guess that sounds a lot more achievable than 10,007.

Yes.

But I just, I feel terrible for those neglected seven hours.

Seven hours is a wonderful amount of time after all.

Sure.

I mean, name the types of things one could do in seven hours.

You could work from nine to four.

You could watch Godfather two twice.

Yes.

You could watch the Irishman that have speed once.

Not all of it probably.

No, I'm not.

Yes.

You'd have to speed it up towards the end.

Yeah.

You could have cut it off before the credits.

Yeah.

So that sounds amazing.

You've been able to be so successful and you're out there doing it personally as well.

Yeah.

I'm out there.

Yes.

And we got a big, a big coup coming up, a big, a big get for us.

Really?

A bond movie has a certain word in the title.

Oh, that's right.

Was that you're doing?

The next bond movie, of course, is entitled No Time to Die.

Wow.

No ellipsis in that, of course.

No.

Didn't do the full Tarantino.

But that's incredible.

What was it called before?

It was called Kookie Killer Bond.

So it was describing James Bond or he was describing whom he was the person he was chasing.

I don't know.

They did a big Page 1 rewrite after they changed the title.

They had to rewrite the entire plot?

Yes.

To make him not a Kookie Killer anymore?

Yes.

And to have him not have enough time in order to die.

Exactly.

Wow.

Well, that's incredible.

So I heard about that movie taking a little, well, time off in between shooting.

Yes.

So that must have been the reason.

It was, yes.

And then we got a big song out of it too.

And I, I carot the lyrics.

You carot the lyrics to Billie Eilish's hit theme?

Yes.

No time to die.

No time to die?

And she changed, you know, she rewrote them considerably?

Yes.

Significantly.

Okay.

But I, you know, I will do a Page 1 rewrite of your lyrics.

Yes.

You know, that stands the one rewrite.

Yeah.

I mean, usually lyrics are maybe about one page.

Sometimes they dip over into a second page.

Like if you ever print out song lyrics in order to sing it.

Yes.

In a time when you ever saw me do that.

You'll waste a lot of paper on the second page because usually it's like, you know, one or two lines.

Yes.

I know just a chorus.

Yeah, exactly.

It's like, I don't need the second page.

I could remember that a chorus comes at the end.

Yes.

Well, that's incredible.

Congratulations.

Thank you.

I, and this is a, maybe a big ask, but do you have the original lyrics to the Billie Eilish songs?

Yes.

In my memory.

You remember them all?

Indeed.

Oh, okay.

Would it be possible for you to recite them then?

Yes.

Will you do that now?

I shall.

Go ahead with the then.

Okay.

Here we go.

This is incredible.

This is, this is the original first draft lyrics to No Time to Die.

The James Bond Spectacular coming out in theater soon.

Yes.

And they, please go see it.

The lyrics will start soon.

That's that's that.

The bars that was early.

Yes.

That was a little reminder for those.

The lyrics are coming up, everyone.

Not fans of instrumental.

So okay.

I should have known my watch would get fixed.

The biggest Desmond Longo is the very, very best in the biz.

He knows all about watch repair.

He should be a billionaire.

He's a great brother in law too.

He once took Maxwell Kiput to the zoo.

Does he listen to Max talk?

When Max talks about time.

Does a broken clock need to wind?

Will I fall in for time?

I love when a clock is right.

I'll ask once, I'll ask twice.

Don't you think that time is nice?

Now you'll never see me cry.

There's just no time to die.

She only kept the last two lines.

She said people won't know who Desmond Longo or Maxwell Kiput.

Why would I sing about them?

So many questions come to mind in hearing all of those lyrics.

Primarily, how was that day of the zoo?

It was fun.

I got a giraffe watch.

You watched a giraffe?

Well, when you put it that way, I did.

Yes, I watched a giraffe.

I said, watch a giraffe was fair play.

That's what Desmond said.

So watching the giraffe was so much fun.

He said, well, tell him about his fair play.

You may as well get a giraffe watch.

You get a giraffe watch.

Could such a thing exist?

And they had it right there in the store.

Now I have to ask about this giraffe watch.

Is the big hand the neck of the giraffe, or is the body of the watch shaped like a giraffe?

In which case, I would think it would be a very clunky thing to be upon a wrist.

No, the big hand is the neck and head of the giraffe.

OK.

And then the small hand is the tail.

OK.

And it's like facing you straight on.

So sometimes it looks like a freakish mutant giraffe.

Frequently.

Well, that is incredible.

I do.

Did it start as a jingle for Longo's watch repair?

Yes.

OK.

I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.

OK.

Right.

Bond theme and get some business for Desmond.

OK.

Well, unfortunately, no one will hear the original version.

So Desmond.

But now they will.

Maybe this one will chart.

It's so nice of you to do that for Desmond.

Does he appreciate that kind of thing?

Did you play it for him?

I did, yes.

What did he say?

He patted me on the head twice.

Really?

Yes.

Did he say anything like turned about his fair play?

Like he was going to write a song for you?

Of course.

No, but I hope he does.

You aren't surprising me with him, are you?

No, he's not here, unfortunately.

There's no one else but you on this episode.

Oh, OK.

That is incredible.

I mean, thank you.

The mirror.

You know, what was even more?

The mirror cat?

Is that what you were going to say?

I saw one of those.

Did you?

Yes.

You watched one?

I watched one.

Do you find a mirror cat song?

Yes.

OK.

I saw a mirror cat.

It turned about, of course.

It turned about.

As previously mentioned, his fair play.

He called it home depot.

He bought a song.

Sound of mirror cat sticker.

Yes.

Of course.

Yeah.

I understand the whole.

Oh, yes.

I don't do explain shopping to you.

Yeah.

I bet you bought all sorts of things.

And that's really incredible.

You know what's even more incredible is the fact that I was just looking on iTunes and found there was a no time to die karaoke version that you could have brought in here.

Oh, but I don't know when the words ago.

Well, it's so wonderful to talk to you.

I could talk to you for hours here.

And you know, so much to unpack.

Hey.

Maxwell, you don't need to shout, hey at me.

No, that's not.

We're in the middle of an interview.

It's not I.

Is y'all saying?

Wait, your catchphrase is Tiz-eye.

But Tiz-eye.

This is the opposite.

It's just particular.

It's y'all saying?

Are you saying JW Stillwater's catchphrase?

Is y'all safe?

Hey.

No.

Hey.

Is y'all saying?

Wait, now you are saying, hey.

Is y'all.

This is good.

This is confusing.

Is y'all safe?

Yeah, JW Stillwater's.

Thank you.

That's right.

It's me, Scott.

Is y'all safe?

I'm safe.

Well, Maxwell, are you safe?

I don't know.

Well, I don't know either, Maxwell, keeper.

Because I haven't seen you in quite some time.

Oh, your eyes just lit up again, and you're crying.

I love time.

How poignant.

I wish I hadn't given you that.

That was a laugh.

Because I'm mad at you.

OK, JW, I understand that you might have caused to be upset.

That's right, I do.

Well, what exactly are you upset about JW?

I'm not privy to what happened.

Oh, I'm not privy.

I didn't even know that you guys knew each other.

First of all, don't get all high-folute and use word like privy.

Well, what do you want me to say instead of privy?

Say, I don't know what y'all's talking about.

Isn't it privy a zoo?

A restroom.

Outhouse.

Yeah, OK.

That's right.

Nothing with plumbing.

It's not a bad film time.

It's got a wood door with a crescent moon carved in it.

Hopefully.

If you're doing it right, if you're doing it right.

How is it that I only been here one minute when we're talking about the bathroom?

You're the one who brought it up?

I came in here for...

You said privy.

But you said it after me.

Stop pointing at me.

You stop pointing at me.

Stop pointing at me.

You stop pointing at me.

Take it out and do it.

I'll do it over.

I'm very upset with the timekeeper.

How do you know each other?

Oh, you wouldn't...

You would not have been privy to this.

Yes, I was certainly not in any room that you guys ever met in.

We had a conversation once where I invited him to join a very special organization.

Really?

I was in here crying after the last episode.

His eyes was all lit up.

Yes.

OK.

Here's Welling.

Here's Welling, but you were...

Here's Welling was there.

Then he left.

You'll see his brother Tom.

Tom Welling was there, of course.

What about Tori Spelling?

She was...

Oh, the Spelling Bee.

Of course, she loves it.

Yes.

Can you use that in a sentence?

With a kilo.

Her catch race.

So you guys had a conversation after the last episode on February 29th?

If you can imagine people having a conversation and you weren't around.

I made me solid statistic if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

Ooh la la!

I'm just ex.

We're hitting a hole of him.

By the way, does he sing Jeremy Piven?

Does he sing Jeremy Piven?

OK.

Seems like a Pearl Jam reference.

I'm not kidding.

Ooh.

But you do get Pearl Jam?

You understand what that is?

Come right, everybody.

Come on now.

You said it too.

What do you mean I said it too?

You just said it.

Come on now.

Now that's what I call it.

You have me a come on now.

All right, what are you upset about?

All right.

We had this conversation where I asked you to join a very special organization and you said that you would.

Tis true.

And now you disappeared.

What?

I guess now we can tell you what the very special organization is.

What is the organization?

I have no idea, no conception of what you could possibly be talking about.

It was the order of the keepers.

What's wrong with you?

Why are you?

I'm stuttering.

I'm so astonished.

Why are you astonished?

Are you a stoner?

Are you bewildered?

Are you bothered?

I may be.

And I'm yours.

I don't know.

That sounds very important, but I couldn't even speculate as to what it is.

I'm not a prospector.

It's true.

He's not.

Look.

I'm not a prospector.

It's true.

He's not.

Look.

That doesn't have the pan.

You don't have a grizzly beard.

Is that the first step in becoming a prospector?

You've got to grow a crazy beard.

Really?

Otherwise you've got to be unkempt.

You're not healthy.

You're too better.

Right.

What about the flap in the back of your, I guess, what are those?

Long johns?

Does that have to be sort of like one button open?

You need to suit.

Right.

Well, you have clothes on.

You don't have to walk around.

You're underwear.

You're not going to do that.

I wouldn't have said that name allowed near an old person.

He said, don't say it.

I thought you were talking about me.

You're a vigilante then.

I'm a vigilante.

You're wearing a mask currently.

Yes, I am.

A cape which is the flag of Florida.

My cape is the flag of Florida.

This is my crime fighting attire.

Right.

Which is different from my secret identity attire.

Which is I don't wear the mask or the cape.

Right.

The coveralls though.

Always on.

I wear the coveralls because.

Just like IFC.

By date.

Slightly off though.

Of course.

Yeah.

Much like that prospector in his flap in the back.

During the day, my secret identity, I'm a fan boat mechanic.

Right.

Under the name Eddie Lee Capers, which is my real name.

Forget that I said that.

Okay.

That's right.

We've delved into your lore on other episodes.

Yeah.

We've delved into my lore.

Your father, Professor Steelwater.

That's right.

And of course your ward.

That's right Cameron Esposito.

Okay.

Many, many other facets of your life.

But this is a facet that I was unaware of.

Well Scott, there's a lot you's unaware of that goes on to keep people safe and protected.

That's what the order of the keepers does.

That's right.

Tell me.

We gather together all of the different people who are keepers of some sort or another like a time keeper.

Oh, okay.

What are then some of the other keepers that are in the order of the keepers?

Well, there's a lighthouse keeper.

Oh, anybody who works in a lighthouse.

Rit, even the people who are in that movie, the lighthouse?

Yes, they're honorary members.

That's fun romp.

Yes.

We give them like little, a little badge they can wear.

They're always in black and white.

They're always in a square.

Wow.

Okay.

What are those gatekeepers?

Right.

People that keep gates of one kind or another.

Oh, there needs to be more of those in comedy.

Agreed.

There's a couple that's very much in love.

He's a and she's a.

He's a keeper.

Oh, and she's a keeper.

Okay.

I get this.

Of course, I'm a promise keeper.

Oh, you are.

As I'm very, I'm very devout religious man.

Okay.

Devoted to Christ.

I need other promise keepers to help me keep my promises which are to be devoted to Christ.

To have friends who are to also devote to Christ and so you need the friends in order to help you keep the promise of having friends.

I promise to never beat my wife if I have one.

I promise.

When did you stop being a wife?

I see you promise.

Now you can't get me with that one because I ain't married.

Oh, that's right.

You're wearing one of those Jonas Brothers rings.

I noticed.

That's right.

Is it from the is it one of the Jonas Brothers originals?

Yes, it is.

It's one of their rings.

And when they gave it up, this was given to me by Jo Jonas who now has sex.

Congratulations.

That's amazing.

Congratulations, Joe.

You met Jo Jonas?

Yeah, that's right.

You were on the comedy painting television show with him.

And he was so enamored with you and he wanted to come back and do sort of what you were doing on a future episode.

Did he say this?

He should play me.

Next time let me be the promise.

The timekeeper.

That is exactly that but something you can do it.

Yes.

Oh my goodness.

You want to be the timekeeper's brother?

Then the long ago?

He wants to be the distance freak.

Yes.

If only there were an episode devoted to them.

Well maybe a future episode.

Probably there will be.

So is that the extent of the keepers?

Be keeper.

Score keeper.

Great.

Trapper keeper.

Goal keeper.

Trapper keeper.

Yes.

Hope Solo is in the group.

Goal keeper.

What about, was there movie solo about her?

I never saw it.

I think so.

The solo, I believe solo was a Star Wars story.

Oh.

I hope solo.

Hope solo.

Free solo.

Solo.

So inanimate objects are in this.

The trapper keepers?

No.

There's people that are trapper keepers.

What does that mean?

You mean meaning like trappers?

The MC Trapper John MD, the TV show?

Of course.

So let's keep picking on the yeah.

I don't think it is.

Do you mean just people who have bought DVD box sets of the Trapper John MD series?

Yeah.

I wish we would have re-thucked that one because that guy sucks.

Number three.

Oh, yes.

That's the stuff.

A lot of long, I mentioned we were going to talk about a lot of long running inside jokes in this one.

Yes.

Does he sing Jeremy Piven, Technicality?

No, don't hula over.

Hula, La Sex.

You had me a come on now.

We never did the shirts.

We're going to do shirts.

Say hula.

La Sex.

Oh, we never did them.

We did do.

Have you seen our teenage mutant into turtle shirts?

It's so funny.

The female picture is true.

The picture is true.

Splinter.

Where that picture comes from?

I have no idea.

I think someone designed it.

I don't know.

I got one the other.

Sean sent me one.

The picture is perfect because it looks so off brand.

Yes.

It looks so off brand.

It seems off brand.

Yeah.

It's like honestly not the best fitting shirt.

It's like such a funny shirt you would get on a street corner.

Yeah.

It's really funny.

But yeah, we did a lot of the old, our five jokes on this one.

And when I was listening to it back, one thing I was thinking is I would love to get Desmond Longo on the show.

We've talked about his- Oh my God.

Yeah.

We've talked about him so much.

Desmond Longo.

Yeah.

So now hopefully Neil is a little more free because I think Brooklyn Nine Nine is about to come on come the new year and they just wrapped up the season.

So maybe we can do that again.

Anyway, great episode.

Can I also plug my hashtag bring back Captain Orleans?

Yes, please.

Go ahead.

I appeared on one episode of Brooklyn Nine Nine.

Yes.

I think that character has the possibility to come back.

I think because it's so improbable to have Raven back on the show.

Sure.

Wasn't he on a boat the last time?

He was a cruise ship captain.

I think they get all the funnier to have him come back.

Yeah.

Like how did this guy get here?

He was demoted.

He was still a captain, but now he's on land.

He's a land captain.

And what about my character?

Gene Koolop played hackers along with Eugene Cordaro and we were promised we were going to come back on the season premiere of the next season.

Not only promised, the way it was put to you was like, well, there's no way we can't have you back on.

Yeah, we've been trying to figure out a way around it, but we have to have you guys back on the show.

Yeah.

And then they figured it way around it.

Yep.

Never heard from them again.

All right.

Let's take a break when we come back the top two, the top two.

No way.

These have been so good.

How could there be better ones?

We'll be right back with more comedy bang bang after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back.

Deed.

What was that little new?

No, he did.

Deed.

What was that little news?

What was that news you do?

You do it.

Little news.

You droid.

These are not the droids we're looking for.

We should stars R2D2 and C3PO in that new buddy film.

We should stars them.

They can't just draw us into Star Wars like they have all those nine movies.

You know what?

This is fucking bullshit.

How's they drew us into big mouth and pretend it was two other people?

Right.

We now are owed star wars.

Yes, Star Wars.

R2D2 and C3PO.

They owe us this.

Yes.

And by the way, if I get R2D2, I'm not going to beep anymore.

I'm going to talk just like this.

I think you can say I'm not going to beep anymore.

I'm going to boop.

That's right.

I may boop.

Boop, boop, boop.

Isn't it funny how R2D2 curses a lot?

Isn't it weird?

I'm just no one speaks his language, I guess.

But like every other fucking word.

C3PO.

C3PO is like, whoa.

How dare you?

I mean, I used to bug me before I spoke the bleeps and bloops that R2 speaks.

Yes.

How upset C3PO is getting.

I'm like, come on, R2D2 is cool.

Pray, speak me the bleeps and bloops that R2 speaks.

A lot of Shakespeare on these episodes.

Right?

Well, we're smart.

He is the immortal bard, of course.

The Morna.

Mel and Coli Dain.

We have the...

The Big Regu.

A lot of people don't know.

Shakespeare wrote all of his lines.

This is a sultan of SWAT.

Speaking of the Big Regu, of course, David Landers passed on this year.

Oh, yes.

Yeah, yeah.

This is the part of the show where we do the In Memoriam.

It's about anyone who dies.

Imagine there's no heaven.

This year for the In Memoriam of the Oscars, they should play the Gal Gadot singing a magic movie for it.

Oh.

That would be fun.

Oh.

That really made me sad when I saw that.

Michael McKeen, who played Lenny to David Landers-Squiggy.

Yep.

Just tweeted out a picture of them when they were young, when they were like a young team.

And it was heartbreaking.

Yep.

Those guys, I don't think I can't downplay what those characters meant to me, comedically as a kid.

Like the earliest beginnings of my love of comedy.

Just two people coming in being funny.

Just being funny.

Yeah.

Like, yeah, supposedly, Liverton and Shirley are the funny ones, but I don't remember ever really laughing at them.

I just remember- I remember laughing at Liverton and Shirley.

Sort of, yeah.

But I do remember the minute those guys came in, it was just like, it was go time.

They pushed that door open with the hello at the most.

How?

After somebody said something that would implicate them.

Yes, I love it.

Like, what kind of idiot would do something like that?

Hello.

Oh.

So good.

Also, the choice to say hello is really funny.

Michael McKeean, by the way, another one of life's great treasures.

But he did not come on and talk about Red Hot Chili Peppers with us, despite all of your tweets.

So why did you want him to do that?

I don't remember.

I remember us saying, yeah, he's got to get on this show with him.

Did you ever hear the Lenny and Squiggy album?

Lenny and the Squigtos?

Oh, I've heard of it, but I maybe I've heard of it.

It's really funny.

I had a copy of it on cassette that I taped from a friend's vinyl.

I don't know if I, I bet you could probably find a digit on line.

Probably on YouTube or something.

But the songs are really funny.

Christopher Guest is in the band.

Yeah.

Clay Guitar as Nigel Tuffnell.

It's like before, before spinal tap.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

That's so funny.

Yeah, it's great.

If you can find it, find it.

Yeah.

If you can find it, find it.

If you can't find it, Dee's nuts.

Um, well, let's get to Dee's episodes.

This is your number two.

I thought we were going to play another round of snowman.

Oh, we can.

We do it right now?

Yeah, we'll do it right now before we talk about what episode two is.

So, episode two, you know, we're going to talk about it before that.

Yeah.

We're going to play another round of snowman.

All right, here we go.

Paul is walking over to the snowman.

Do you want to press the snowman?

I can't hear you, but, uh, oh, he's exactly where he was.

This is what he said.

Okay, great.

All right, he's dancing around.

I'm all, let me turn this up.

He's dancing around.

He's twirling.

He's in the direction of Koolop again.

He's twirling.

No, he's back to Koolop.

What is this?

If she's out there on the ballot, she is thrilled.

No, now over to the squirrel.

This is it though.

He's got one last turn.

Not he's a little off my shoulder.

It's so close though.

Like from where I'm sitting, it looks like he's looking.

Nah, he's pretty far off, I would say.

Let's take a photo.

All right, I'll take a photo of how far off he is and I'll send it to you and you'll see exactly why it can't be as thrilled as...

I mean, this is dramatic.

Yeah.

Like what I'm looking at, it's like...

Dooling photos here.

I'm sending one to you.

You're sending one to me.

This is like a real photo-palooza.

I wouldn't go that far.

Okay, I'm sorry.

I apologize.

Hey, fun's fun, but let's not over-represent this.

Misrepresent this to the people listening.

It's not really a photo-palooza gang.

It's just two guys taking one photo of a piece.

All right, let's talk about it.

This is episode...

This is the number two episode of the year.

You really zoomed in, I wish you hadn't.

This is episode 638.

It's still in the 600s, interesting.

And this is February 3rd.

So this is about a month before...

So what happens on February 3rd?

Nothing.

You're not going to be able to figure this.

This is an episode called One Last Heist.

♪ One last heist ♪ ♪ One last heist ♪ Do you remember this episode?

Did you listen to it?

I don't know.

I may have, but I don't know by the title.

Okay, so this is Jason Manzougas.

I'm out.

We have Sean...

I'm kidding.

Sean Diston and Tim Balz.

And...

I mean, this sounds good.

It does sound good.

Tim Balz is not going to be in this clip.

And because he...

Sounds less good.

He comes in a little later where he plays...

I think he's...

He's Cincinnati playboy Antonio Lembradini.

Which is funny, but we're not going to play that clip.

This is the clip where Jason Manzougas are talking for a bit.

And then my old friend, Bullitt Jackson, enters, played by Sean Diston.

And I don't want to say any more about it.

I'll just let you hear it.

This is your episode two.

Number two.

By the way, Jason Manzougas is here.

You know, hello from that of This Get Made podcast as well.

Welcome back to the show.

Thrilled to be here.

When you die...

Yeah.

What do you want to be buried?

I...

Real question.

You want to be cremated, I believe, because every time I go to a graveyard, I guess they call them graveyard or funeral home or whatever, I just think it's such a...

Ooh, graveyard and funeral home?

Noxenomis.

Those would be two different places.

Yeah.

What's the difference between them?

A graveyard?

What? And a funeral home?

Well, meaning...

I mean, like, let's just...

Let's dial in.

Let's dial in first on yard versus home.

I mean, a forest lawn type of place, which you can't just call it a graveyard.

It's a cemetery.

It's a cemetery. That's the word I was looking for.

Oh, you were looking for cemetery and instead found funeral home.

Yeah, yeah.

Where you go to the way.

Yes, yes, yeah.

But does it forest lawn the cemetery?

Sure.

Has a funeral home at it.

So that's where the confusion lied.

Let's not get into another...

Or...

The argument that I'm going to win, okay?

Because the viewers...

That's the viewers have spoken.

That's the pillow coffin this?

The pillow coffin argument was decidedly in my favor.

But...

I look at those as just a colossal waste of space.

I agree.

Oh, no.

Same with me.

Burn me up.

Let me up, sky.

Burn me up.

Burn me up, baby.

Just to burn me down.

Do you hope that also that video screen will have the last credits from something about Mary?

Is that what it is?

Yes.

No, for real.

Burn me up.

Get rid of me.

Like, I don't want to be in the earth.

I don't want people...

I don't want to be in an urn that people have to look at.

I don't want people to feel like, well, if I want to reconnect with my old friend, Jason, who's passed away, I got to go to a place...

To a place where his body is currently decomposing in the ground.

No, thank you.

Burn me up.

Let me be in everyone's memories.

Like a little...

Here's what I want.

I want a final How did this get made show?

And I want a little bit of my ashes to be sprinkled in every audience member's mouth.

What do you want to...

Do you just want Paul and June to be doing that?

Or do you want your replacement to be hosting that one?

No, I mean, like, they can use my replacement.

Okay, so there's no mourning period.

Like the next episode you have a replacement.

Yeah, that's fine.

That's fine.

I think that's appropriate.

I think it's probably fine.

I want to be burned with you.

So, by the way, it's first...

Just hold on to the other one.

Yes.

Well, I'm not going to be burned with you.

But here's what I will promise you.

I will wait until I'm ready to go.

I will keep you on Ice Casey K some style.

Okay, thank you.

Above ground, ready to rock and roll.

And what...

It's like Casey K some style.

Do you mean his dog being on ice or what?

No, I mean, his family didn't...

Oh, that's right.

Didn't bury him for...

Didn't bury him.

His wife kept...

His new wife kept shuffling him around his corpse.

Not Jean K some certainly.

Her corpse, shuffling his corpse around the world so his children couldn't get a hold of it.

Doing the K some shuffle.

And processed it.

And he still recorded every week's episode of the Top 40.

It's incredible.

His commitment.

Speaking of the Top 40, I wanted to bring this up because you and I were in a conversation with a friend of ours before the show.

And he said his first CD that he bought was Please Hammer Don't Hurt Him.

Who is the pussy?

I'm not talking about our friend.

But who's the pussy who's saying that?

You know, what part of Hammer's crew?

Oh, oh, oh, he's saying, Please Hammer Don't Hurt Him?

Yeah.

Who is this guy?

And...

Please Hammer.

Let's do it or hurt him.

Please Hammer.

Please.

Wait, are you saying you want to be that guy?

Cause this seems like an audition.

It kind of is.

I'd like to see that story.

Do you think that's the meant to be the delivery of Please Hammer Don't Hurt Him?

Please Hammer Don't Hurt Him.

So this guy's crying.

He's got a family.

He's got kids.

He's got a family.

My assumption is Please Hammer Don't Hurt Him is a reference to like, Don't kill the audience too much by being so amazing.

No, that's what this guy thinks too.

Oh, so he's just weeping, begging on his knees.

Like John Tetero in Miller's Crossing.

Look into your heart.

Have a look into your heart.

I'll suck you, dude.

That's not part of the movie, but interesting.

That's very very...

Menestuous society.

Well, come here later.

We have the Cincinnati Playboy, but let's get to our first...

You're my co-host, so let's get to our first guest.

What do you say?

I would love it.

He's an old friend of mine.

I love that.

I just had to have an old friend on the show.

Terrific. Do I know him?

I know a lot of your old dear friends.

You do not know this one, I don't believe.

Please welcome to the show, Bullitt's Jackson.

Scott.

Hi, Bullitt's.

I'm getting the band back together.

Whoa!

What?

We were just talking about...

What?

Not a music band.

Oh, I was gonna say, were you guys in a band?

I didn't know you were ever in a band.

I was in a band one last job.

Okay, oh, a heist.

Wait, we're doing one last job.

What's the jot?

I told you.

One last job, Scott.

Wait, when did you...

You mean you just...

I told me just five seconds ago.

I've been repeated myself.

I told you, Scott.

We have one last job, Scott.

Let's go.

Trap all this podcast shit.

Let's get out of here.

Okay, I can cover this.

I don't wanna leave it to Jason.

I can cover this.

Can you just wait like an hour or something?

Bullitt's with the likelihood that Scott will die on this job.

Scott is pretty hot.

Well, then I'm glad we had the conversation we had over here.

Yeah, I guess so.

Look, what kind of job do you wanna do?

I don't remember exactly what we were last.

One last heist, Scott.

Yeah, what are we heisting?

I don't...

We're stealing Blue Boy.

Blue Boy.

Is Blue Boy?

Blue Boy is a famous painting at the Huntington Library Garden here in Pasadena.

Oh, so it's nearby.

It's pretty close.

Blue Boy.

That's right, Scott.

How much it's worth?

It's priceless.

Well, priceless.

Is it really priceless?

That's right, Scott.

They've been renovating it for over a year.

They've been renovating the painting?

That's right.

This is terrifying.

Is that how you renovate?

Yeah, you've seen renovating painting renovations.

Remember that Jesus one that came out saying that?

Oh my God, that was amazing.

Looks like a big smiley face.

Like the watchman cover.

That's right.

Now, Scott, are you ready to go?

I don't, I mean, couldn't we wait like an hour for traffic to die on?

I have gotten so much of the band back together and you're kind of a final piece.

Who else have you got?

Well, it's a big, it's a big band.

Yeah, there's like 60, 67 of them?

67 people that I'm painting.

I'll take you.

You've definitely got a leak.

Well, I'm sorry.

I'm 67 members of the team without somebody being...

No way.

...or working for the police.

Scott, you were telling the police.

No, Scott, you remember working with this team.

We were as tight as...

I don't recall exactly.

I mean, we're friends from, you know, back in the day.

Back in the day, Scott.

Yeah.

The crime days.

When was this?

How long did you guys know each other?

Back in what day?

Scott, I remember it was just yesterday.

Oh, it was yesterday.

What was I doing yesterday?

No, but it was a long time ago.

Oh, oh, oh.

But I remember it as if it was just yesterday.

Scott, I remember it.

Oh, wow.

Well, Scott was our distraction guy.

I don't remember.

What did I do to describe...

Well, you'd walk it.

Okay, so one time we robbed...

You remember when we robbed that bank, Scott?

I remember being in a bank.

Okay, so Scott walks into the bank and he's doing a very funny, old, bad character.

Oh.

And he's like...

It's funnier when you're younger.

Like, if I were to do it now, it would be like, Oh, look, I'm five years older.

It's kind of not that fun.

But when I'm younger, it was like...

It was hilarious, really fun.

So the intent was to be hilarious.

So you're the distraction.

The diversion was comedy.

Comedy, Scott is what we called him.

Exactly, which is why you grabbed Scott Ocherman.

That's right.

We grabbed comedy, Scott, for the greatest distractions in history.

I mean, I don't understand, Scott, why you're so confused.

This was your life, Scott.

Well, I remember being at a bank and you guys saying, like, hey, do your old man character.

Yeah, and then a series of interconnected events led to us walking out of that bank with a bunch of fucking buddies.

You guys got money from that?

Hell yeah, Scott, why didn't you give it to me?

Oh, were you...

Did you not come to the...

Okay, that's all it be because I get...

You didn't give me that details for the after heist?

Okay, so I do get the band together before, but I forgot...

What about the after heist?

I'm supposed to also get the band together after the heist.

And I think I might have left you off.

You're really good at getting the band together before the heist seems.

That's really...

Basically, it looks like you show up and you go, are you in or you out?

And then most of the time, people drop what they're doing right away and come with me, Scott.

I'm in the middle of a show.

I can't really do that.

I didn't even know you got money on it.

I don't profit from these.

And by the way, how do you split something priceless up?

67 wins.

Okay, Scott, I'm going to interrupt for just a second.

Yeah, it's like we all get 67 priceless shares.

We were at lunch just the other day.

I saw it pretty late.

You said...

You know what, man?

I don't have any adventures anymore.

You were complaining about how...

How stayed and kind of on track your life has become do a podcast per week.

Dinner with your ex-girlfriend.

Go to a meeting.

You know, pop, pop, pop.

Everything has become so regimented.

And you were like, I really just want a little bit of chaos in my life.

Yeah.

Like I used to have.

And you do drugs again.

Here is bullets, Jackson, offering you an opportunity.

Oh, yeah.

Scott, I'll offer in you the perfect opportunity.

This could be the highest...

What's your plan?

Is it the perfect crime?

It...

Well, Jason, hold on.

Let me think about it.

What if you go there?

Okay.

Jason, I...

I think it might be the perfect crime.

Were you adding thought about this?

I did, and I thought it was pretty good, but I just put all the pieces together.

The equation kind of equals the perfect crime.

What is the plan and what is my part of it?

Am I still the distraction guy?

You're still the distraction guy, of course.

And that's your skills.

What kind of character do I have to do now?

Well, that's up to you, Scott.

Oh, really?

What do you think you might want to do?

Well, I can't do the old man.

Maybe I could do a baby, though, the reverse.

Well, you could do the old man now and not have to do any of the makeup or hair gray.

Well, no, no, no, no.

What if I'm the guy who's talking to Hammer?

You could be...

Please!

You could...

Please!

I haven't in y'all.

I'm looking through y'all hot, don't hurt him.

Okay, let me think this out for a second.

They hang up Blue Boy after a long restoration period.

There's a huge crowd of people.

When are they hanging up at...

They're hanging up at...

They hang it up at 5 p.m.

5 p.m.

So they've restored it after the renovations?

Yeah, they've restored it as well.

They renovate restoration along with the renovations.

But then they renovated it.

So what does that entail?

Like doing the wood behind it?

Yeah, they put the wood, they kind of just like dusted it a bit.

Yeah.

That's kind of what they did.

Okay.

Now, let's go do this.

Now, there's a bunch of people watching.

They put up Old Boy.

Okay.

And then...

Blue Boy or Old Boy?

I think it's Old Boy.

Old Boy, the Korean movie.

Old Boy is some...

We're not stealing Old Boy.

Guys, Scott, I can't believe...

We're stealing the original...

Hold on, hold on, hold on.

Are we stealing Old Boy?

No, Old Boy is the code name for Blue Boy, Scott.

Oh, of course.

Do you now remember the way we do things?

Codes, right.

Slightly confusing code names.

Okay, so why are they putting up Old Boy at 5PM?

They're putting up Old Boy at 9AM.

Well, because that is when they close.

Oh.

So they're having a big press event.

Tomorrow?

Tonight and five.

When they close.

So they're putting it up at five?

Right now, over this, like, the visuals should be being shown.

Yeah.

Right.

Yeah.

When we're hearing this in V.O.

But we're seeing the crime in progress.

Exactly.

First of all, we've got a man at the ticket station.

The...

He's going to be making sure you get in for free without having to...

It might be the song, by the way.

This is pretty good.

So you'll get in for free and not have to pay because we've got a guy on the inside of the ticket station.

And you'll walk into the museum.

Oh, I have to pay because of why?

Oh, we have a guy on the inside as a ticket ticket.

What's a ticket ticket?

He's one of 67.

I'll take your ticket.

Exactly.

Dun, dun, dun.

And then, Scott, you're going to walk into the food courts.

Now, this is a very important part of the plan.

Well, I'm going to stop you right there.

Oh, okay.

This is the Huntington Garden food court.

Yeah, they got...

You would have they got there.

They got...

They run it down for me.

They got coffee.

Dun, dun, dun.

They got bananas.

Orange Julius?

Dun, dun, dun.

They don't got orange Julius, but they have orange scones.

Is there a...

Sabaro?

No, there's not a Sabaro.

You know, maybe he's not a food court.

So there's no licensed restaurants there.

Dun, dun, dun.

There's no licensed restaurants.

So yet...

Less of a food court, more of a snack bar?

Exactly.

Dun, dun, dun.

There's a Popeyes guy on the inside, applying for an application to be inside the food court.

Who's the Popeyes guy?

He currently works at Popeyes?

He's one of 67, Scott.

He's our Popeyes guy.

Are there anyone who is two of 67?

No, is there a way out of twins or not involved?

No, the twins are dead, Scott.

You guys don't have twins.

The twins are dead to us because they didn't send us a Christmas card.

Dun, dun.

So anyways, the Popeyes guy...

Are we flashing back to the Christmas card deliberation right now?

We can go back to the Christmas card.

Should we extend him a Christmas card this year?

Nah, he'll probably be fine if we don't send him.

We're not going to get kicked out of the 69.

Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

Pan up to the vents.

I'm in the vents looking down.

These motherfuckers.

Ooh, ooh.

I liked it better when there were 69 of us.

I gotta say.

We should get those twins back.

That's what I said.

Okay, 69 with twins.

Scott, if we could get old boys, AKA blue boy, I'm sure we could attract the twins back.

Guys, I'm not in a lie.

I bet we can get the sclars in on this.

That's who we're talking about.

Those boys!

Two guys, they say the lines all together at the same time.

Dun, dun, dun.

So here, Scott, this is your part.

Dun, dun.

Okay.

Blue boy's hanging on the wall.

Dun, dun, dun.

Of the snack bar?

No, we've actually now gone to the museum section over the library.

Why did I go to the snack bar?

To talk to the Popeyes guy.

I just talked to him?

Yeah, he's going to slip you a razor blade.

Oh, because they wouldn't have let me pass through the...

Win with the razor blade.

Yeah, exactly.

Okay, cool.

And if so, that's in case the job goes wrong, you can kill yourself.

Exactly.

You put that in your mouth, you bite against it, and then I would kill it.

You bite against it?

No, no, this is the way it's hidden.

And then with the grain.

And then if anyone catches you, you swallow it.

You bite right, you chomp right through your palate.

You chop through your palate, then you chew it up and you swallow it.

You bite your own tongue out.

And then it takes you like a week for your stomach to just say, right?

Yeah, damn right, Scott.

You're starting to remember.

So anyways, you take that razor blade, you put it in your mouth, and you start heading to the museum.

This is a good song, by the way.

You take the razor blade and you put it in your mouth.

I also like the bass sort of solos you guys have been adding.

Those are really good.

So anyways, blue boy gets put up on the wall.

Scott walks in and it's his baby character.

Okay.

Right?

So, wait, so did I walk into the museum?

You walked into the museum?

Or did I change after the food court?

God damn it, Scott, I didn't even think about a change.

All right, so Scott, I love to do like three changes.

Okay, okay.

First change.

Like Sherwood.

You jump right into the ladies' bathroom, Scott.

And why the ladies' bathroom?

Because you come out as an old woman.

Wap, wap, wap, wap, wap, wap.

And now it's the ree.

Do you know where all of the paintings are?

And then a boy points, blue boy is right over there.

And then you go into the men's room and then change again.

And this time you come out as Jimmy Stewart.

Oh, man.

I hate that.

That's terrible.

You're an old man.

Oh, man.

That's very questionable.

Don't make a lot of money.

Wait a minute, is that your ghost of Jimmy Stewart?

Everybody run.

Mr. Potter.

Run, that's the ghost of Jimmy Stewart.

Then you go in and shit me more than...

Go ahead, sorry.

No, no.

Go ahead.

And then everyone's scared.

Everyone's scared of the ghost of Jimmy Stewart.

Yeah, I was a Jimmy Carter.

Oh, man.

Wait, could I do Jimmy Carter?

Hey, if you want to go back, he's still alive.

I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

And now you pop into the actual...

You pop into the bathroom that is gender neutral.

Oh, good.

And this time you pop out as the baby.

So your third costume change.

Are you satisfied?

Okay, I'm good.

Yeah, I'm good with her.

And then they put the painting on the wall.

Give me, give me, give me, give me.

Who's baby is this?

Al Sharpton runs in.

He's one of 67.

Wait, Al Sharpton is part of the crew or someone playing.

How do you not remember Scott?

Al Sharpton himself is a part of the crowd.

That's right.

He's our media guy.

He's our crew.

He's a very big jumpsuit budget.

Yeah, there were so many jumpsuits.

And there were mostly his.

Well, they were jumpsuits and tracksuits.

He called them jumpsuits because he jumped in them.

Now...

He was a great guy.

Exactly.

Back of the day.

I loved him.

Yeah, any suit he wore, he called him jumpsuits.

And he would just jump around.

Go around me.

Dun dun dun.

And then he looks out and says, what a baby is this?

And then everyone's like, I don't know who's baby.

This is, I don't know who's baby.

This is, wait a minute.

That's a, is that he's wearing blue.

Is that a blue boy?

So that's kind of funny because blue boys are like, well, do we all in is to convince people the boy in the painting is come to life?

Yes, exactly.

Like a purple rose of Cairo's age.

I know we're not supposed to talk about woody.

Is woody involved?

Scott?

Oh, Jesus.

He has been applied to be a part of the crew for a very long time.

He wanted to be 70.

We have respectfully said no.

He's canceled.

He's canceled out of the crew.

So nobody out of, if anyone was wondering, he is not a part of the crew.

Okay.

So, so I'm the baby come to life.

Yes.

And everyone laughs, you said?

Everyone laughs, but then they get scared again because they said, the ghost of Jimmy Stewart, a baby come to life.

Is this some sort of ghostbuster situation?

Oh, right.

Answer the call.

And then some people excited about a new ghostbuster.

People, as respectful as they were about the last one.

Exactly.

They start talking about the new ghostbusters.

It wouldn't ruin anyone's childhood.

They think this time it's going to be a little bit different.

They really like that it's centered on Egon for some reason.

And everyone just starts to slowly walk out.

In like a motion?

Yes.

Slow motion walk out.

So they're all doing that.

Yeah.

Something about the, about it goes in the scene.

Duh-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

Can I just say, can I just say, there's a little too much music going on.

Oh, really?

You think this is overscored?

I think it might be overscored.

Really?

Yeah, I think it might be.

Aren't we still in the montage?

We are in the montage for sure.

I'll do much shiller scoring when we're out of the montage in actual scene work.

Okay.

We need less cues.

Less cues.

Okay.

Got it.

All right.

So everyone think they're walking out of the slow-motion.

Oh, now you want music.

Wow.

Just like a director.

Look, I'm the honest.

I am not the director.

Oh, what?

I'll be honest.

I'm not the director.

The director is what is it called?

What kind of music do you want, sir?

It's William Friedkin still in the crew.

I don't know who that is.

He's a director.

Let me check.

Billy Frieds.

William Frieds.

He is in the crew.

I don't actually know him, but he is a part of, he's a new ad to the crew.

He's a very famous director.

Maybe he's directing this one.

I mostly do HR.

You're a critical.

Internal complaints and so forth.

You have no part of this.

No, no, no, no.

Do you guys do like a sexual harassment seminar, or the whole, the hype starts?

Oh, yeah.

Well, I mean, there's a man to be.

It's like a small business.

There's 67 of them.

Sure.

69.

Sometimes, but that kind of can be problematic.

If you're going to be so close at 67, you've got to go for 69.

Even though that does encourage jokes that would probably exactly get people into a HR trouble.

And I don't like to get people into HR trouble.

Yeah.

With criminals.

HR trouble.

So I'm assuming.

HR trouble stuff.

I'm assuming everyone backs up and then we're free to tear the painting there or just take it off the wall or whatever.

Oh, no, no.

We got a more complicated.

We got to bring it on.

All right.

So then our axe guy comes in.

Axe guy.

Yeah, he's got axe body spray.

Yes, he's got an axe body spray.

Okay.

So he comes in.

So he sprays it everywhere.

No one wants to come back.

Oh, everybody gets so turned.

Oh, no, they don't want to come in.

They don't want to come in.

But if they stay in, they get turned on to want to fuck.

Then they're distracted.

Yeah.

Okay.

So the best of both worlds.

The best of both worlds.

Can we license this for the soundtrack?

Yes.

This is great.

This in Van Halen put it in.

So now everyone's distracted.

Now we got to bring in our fingerprint gas.

Fingerprint guy.

He comes in and wipes down all the fingerprints so there's no evidence.

Oh, so he's an anti-fingerprint guy.

So he's more of like an anti-fingerprint guy.

So none of us are wearing gloves.

We're just cavalier about putting our fingerprints wherever we go.

We've got a fingerprint guy.

If you come in wearing gloves, they know you're trying to steal some.

Well, I mean, it is the winter though.

Oh, wait a minute.

Don't, don't, don't.

All right.

Maybe we could get rid of this guy.

Don't, don't, don't.

Skip this whole fingerprint cover-ups.

And maybe just go to the chemical castration section.

Oh, what now?

Oh, yeah.

We all got to be chemically castrated before we leave.

Temporarily.

Wait, you can temporarily chemically castrate yourself.

I'm assuming isn't- Yeah, it's a dope.

It's like, is in a pill.

You just got to stop taking the pills.

Yeah, you just got to stop taking the pills.

Oh, okay.

So we all take six- Are you familiar with, give me that pill?

I've heard that.

I think you're the deal with that to be.

That's what it was about?

I think the deal with them be- Don't give me that pill.

Don't give me that pill.

Okay, God.

You say, give me that pill until you don't want it.

Then you say, don't give me that pill.

Why are we all- we need to be chemically castrated because of the Axe body spray.

No distractions.

Okay, I see.

How many times have you been on a heist?

You fall in love.

God damn it.

If I was not tuned into this frequency, I'd be able to steal so much better.

It's true.

All right, so the next part of the game, heat, you have to be ready to walk away from a situation in 30 seconds at any point if you feel the police are coming around the corner.

That is incredible.

That's why I said Scott, you should be running with me right now, Scott.

I can't believe we're still doing a goddamn goddamn.

I can't.

So anyways, here's what happens.

In the montage, we are ripping it off.

We are doing a terrible- No, it's not like we're here.

You know what?

We're kind of doing like a dry run.

This is actually very helpful.

It's helping you at least.

It's helping you figure it out.

Here's what I'll say.

We do need a glove guy.

When somebody animates this, it will go to Sundance.

Yeah, definitely.

Okay, so after we're chemically castrated, all the very cool and powerful, smart, sexy women come in.

Okay.

This is why we have to get cable- Are they part of the 69?

Oh yeah, there's six of them.

Six out of the 69.

We call them the sexy six.

No.

Okay.

I love this.

So they, first of all- They have their own branding.

They do, but it is a nightmare for HR, I will say.

I will get it.

As the person who's doing those meetings, and then I have to then introduce them as the sexy six.

I feel like, to me, I'm sort of- anyways, we're back to the play.

The sexy six out of it.

And then they start- Dump, dump, dump.

Slowly taking the painting off the wall.

Dump, dump, dump.

How slow?

As slow as you can make that high hat.

Why are they- They're moving so slow.

Everybody's slowed down.

And then you realize the painting's gone.

Everybody's gone.

And you just woke up because you've been drugged.

Bump, bump, bump.

By our drug game.

So the drug guy has drugged you.

It's now 24 hours later.

Right.

Okay.

So the whole team, once the painting gets got, the whole team goes into a- We're re-drained.

Everybody gets forced into a medical- You get coma?

Fully into a medical induced coma.

And what you remember of the crime is actually just a fragmented dream.

Oh, this is a total recall scenario.

So exactly.

You get that into a total recall scenario?

That's damn right.

So that when you're interrogated about it, you don't know what's going on.

Damn thing.

It sounds like you just are remembering the plot of a movie.

This is brilliant.

So Scott, are you ready to go?

No, I still have another half hour left on this show.

I think we can get there by five hour.

Yeah.

And traffic's kind of bad at this point.

We just kind of skipped the 134 if that's cool.

Like we'll go through Griffith Park probably.

Griffith Park.

Okay.

Yeah.

I'll text the team.

All right.

Great.

I'll text the team.

Are you guys on all on a WhatsApp?

We're on a big group meme.

We send a lot of memes to each other.

It's funny as hell.

I got to get on this.

Number two.

Oh, yeah.

I mean, that was a good app.

Good app.

Did someone animate this?

I don't remember.

We sent a lot of memes to each other.

I got to get on this.

Number two.

Oh, yeah.

I don't remember.

We asked people to.

I feel like somebody did something with the music, right?

By the way, the dude who's been animating clips of the show.

We're going to see you in court.

Yeah.

See?

And just it.

You don't have the rights of that audio.

Those have been really good.

Yeah.

They've been really awesome.

And I wish I had the information of who you are at my fingertips, but who has two thumbs and doesn't have that info?

Ioni.

I'm going to show you a little bit of the next episode.

The number one episode of the year.

And another round of Snowman.

That's right.

That's a tease too.

We'll be and the Snowman is a tease.

Never look at at me.

We'll be right back when we're coming back after this.

Comedy bang bang.

Paul, we've come down to it.

Scott, I know and we have and I agree with you to do the same thing that you do.

It's just to say we have come right down to it.

Well puts could not put that any better.

This is exciting.

If you had any guess as to what the episode would be, what do you think it would be?

Well, first I'm thinking about the first person to ever phrase it well put and how that was received.

It must have been received pretty well because otherwise we wouldn't have that as an expression.

Right.

But it sounds annoying when I think about it.

It does.

It's one thing to say.

Yeah, you're trying to be funny.

People sound really snooty when any of the famous sayings.

All of the famous sayings are packed with the snoots.

Stitch in time saves nine.

Oh, thanks asshole.

A Betty's name.

Let's do t-shirts for that.

A Betty's name is a Betty Hernd.

No shit.

So it's on the front is a Cichin time saves nine.

That's right.

And then on the back is thanks asshole.

We're moving into, I mean all of our podcast shirts are inexplicable but we're moving into things that don't even make sense to us.

I feel like a Betty's name is depending on your notion.

No shit.

To air is human to forgive is divine.

Whatever.

Three variations.

Or maybe three sides to the shirt.

Six sides.

It's all of the, you have to match it up.

The front is all of the first part of these sections.

So it's six different half shirts.

And you can mix and match.

And have Velcro on the side.

Yes.

You can mix and match what you want your rejoinder to be on the back.

You can tear it apart like those pants to turn your shorts.

Like the ones that I wore as Billy Flynn in Chicago where I tore them off and I was in my underwear.

Oh no, Scott, you didn't.

I was but 17.

And I have a 17 year old butt.

Butt naked.

No, I was not butt naked.

By the way, it's butt naked.

It's not butt naked.

I know, but everyone starts saying butt naked because they can't fathom that it would be butt naked.

I know.

It's very, there's expressions like that where it's like, it's a lateral, like I get where you, how you got there.

Yeah.

It's wrong.

You know what I don't like is, and you see this on the bachelor, the bachelor at every week is, do you want to cheers?

I hate that so much.

It's do you want to propose a toast or should we toast?

Yeah.

And then you say cheers as the exclamation when you cheers.

So we're cheering.

Oh my God, I cannot stand it.

Yeah.

And anyways, in any case, what about that?

Heat any quakes.

Let's get to it.

This is your episode one.

Number one.

All right.

You know what it's time for.

Well, should we do it at the end or should we do it?

We should only do it one more time.

I think we should do it one more time if it ends satisfactorily.

Okay.

And if it doesn't, we'll do it one more time at the end.

Okay.

All right.

We're going to do the snowman game.

Do you want to press the snowman?

What do you press his little palm?

Yeah, he's got a little red dot there.

Got a little red dot on his palm.

Now he's dancing around.

The top hat is twirling.

So he's still off my shoulder.

Maybe I should move.

Twirling still.

Yeah.

Well, he did the same over to Coolop a couple of times on the last one.

Now he's over at the squirrel again.

This is going to be it.

All right.

Come on, baby.

Oh, right at me down the barrel.

All right.

That feels good.

It does, doesn't it?

That is right on me.

I could see from here.

He's like looking right at you.

I mean, it's eye contact.

It's like Robert's in your own milking me contact.

I'll take you down.

They're trying to tell.

Wow.

Amazing.

And then we'll do it one more time to see if he looks at me.

Okay.

That wasn't the plan.

Okay.

Oh, you just said and satisfactorily, which means looking at you.

New plan, dick bitch.

All right.

This is episode one.

Any predictions?

I predict this is going to be the most important one.

Yeah.

And that this is the one that people like the most.

Ah, there you go.

You are not wrong.

This was from this is episode 632.

Wow.

Still, it's 600.

600.

This is from December 16th of 2019.

This is a while ago.

Yes.

Now, we all know that the year that we count is not the calendar year of January to December.

We count Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving in order to give us enough time to tabulate the vote.

Yes.

Surprise.

So last year's December 16th episode was eligible.

And this is the episode called the 2019 holiday spectacular.

I mean, these are always a blockbusters.

Now, this, let me tell you who's on this episode.

I dare you.

Jason Manzukas.

John Gabris as Geno.

Sean Diston as Sprague the Whisper.

Lauren Lapkis as my nephew Todd.

Tim Balz as Darren Matichik, the Bobblehead Museum guy.

Lily Sullivan who will hear a clip from.

Can I shout out Lily Sullivan?

And you certainly can now.

It's appropriate.

Yes.

Will Hines who we will hear a clip from.

Zeke Nicholson as Etouffé.

Paul and Tomkins comes in halfway through a Santa Claus.

I forgot where you were coming from, but you came in late.

All is a mistake on these shows.

What's weird though is you started doing callbacks to things without knowing that they were callbacks.

Oh, I kind of remember that.

Yeah.

Zacharino is Dash Grabham who's the Pokemon trainer and Drew Tarver and Carl Tarte who we will hear from as well.

So a lot of people, what usually happens is I put out a blanket request to a lot of people.

Everyone is supposed to bring a blanket.

Oh, yes.

Please.

Sometimes they bring them with smallpox.

And I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go, I go.

I ask people to do the show, thinking most.

We'll say no.

Yeah.

So just in my first wave, just about everyone said, yes.

So you put up three more waves.

Three more waves.

So this is a lot of people.

This is all on you.

And this was a weirdly enough.

This is a strange statistic.

This was a two hour and 36 minute podcast.

This year's holiday episode, which just dropped a couple of weeks ago, I just got the final version of it and checked it out.

It is two hours and 36 minutes.

We're weird.

They're exactly the same.

But this was two hours and 36 minutes of all of us and most people stayed the entire time and didn't leave.

And they're always like really fun clusterfucks with everyone trying to get their callbacks and their jokes in on top of everyone else.

And we're also gifted little bags of candy.

Yes.

And I think that might.

My coworker, Corinne usually makes them, didn't make them this year because she was like, I would have to drop them off at everyone's house.

Yeah.

But Corinne, Corinne, who's wonderful, puts these little candy bags together.

And I, not everybody eats the candy, but a significant amount of people eat the candy.

But then I usually eat all the leftovers.

So I'm sitting there eating.

But it makes you, it makes you crazy.

Yes.

It makes you insane.

It makes you a hyperactive child.

So we're going to hear three clips from this.

Me and you, you in the floor.

Me and you in the floor.

The two of us in the dance floor.

That's right.

Calm down, sing.

That's what I'm saying.

Calm down, sing.

I tell you a story about that song.

Oh, we did.

You know the part of the end where it's like the horns come in like a band.

Yeah.

Like a big band playing.

See.

I had, I taped that song off my CD player and I would listen to it all the time.

And I found out way later that my tape player that I was recording all these CDs off of had a channel missing.

Had like the left channel missing or something like that.

And it was recording in Mono, but only the right channel.

So I listened to that song again.

Like years later.

And suddenly I heard the other horn part.

Which was, is a counter melody going, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

And I was frightened by, I was startled by it because I had never heard that song.

And then that's how I realized I was like, what, this is a weird version.

Why does it have this other horn part?

And that was why I realized that my tape player was broken.

I never heard that horn part.

Are we talking about the same song because what you're describing sounds like the six flags thing.

What's the.

Good shit.

Speaking of good shit, let's hear this clip.

What do you say?

We're going to hear three different clips from this episode.

Let's hear them all in a row.

Let's do.

Let's do them all in a row.

With a little, with a little, a little shimmery sound.

It's true.

Sure, why not?

This is the episode that you chose as your number one.

This is on you.

Number one.

We do need to talk to her.

She's been very patient sitting here.

Has never been on the show before.

Am I right about that?

Yes.

Talk right into that microphone.

Dear.

Yes.

Oh, God.

You should be more condescending later.

Please welcome to the show Tracy M. Hello, Tracy.

Hi.

I'm Elle.

It's that time of year again when we all ship Omaha stakes to each other.

Oh, is he?

Are you an Omaha stakes red?

Are we sponsored by Omaha stakes?

Nothing says I love you.

Like shipping a big case of meat to someone in a cardboard box and then opening it up and finding some stake.

Is this a commercial?

$69.95.

You can ship 10 Omaha stakes to someone you love.

Jingle bells.

Oh, is that the code?

I feel like we're being robo dialed in the studio.

Yeah.

It's so great to be here.

Thank you for having me.

Yeah, Tracy.

Tracy is here.

Tracy is around.

Do you work for Omaha stakes?

I do.

Thank you so much for asking.

Oh, you're welcome for answering.

But nothing says I'm sorry.

Like a bunch of meat in a cardboard box.

Hey, listen to that, Scott.

You could send me that.

I think you're good with a porridge.

How does a case of meat say I'm sorry?

It's kind of seems like a threat to be honest.

96% of people would prefer a gift of food than a gift of product.

Oh, okay.

How is it food or product?

It's a complicated question.

So I feel like the 95% might have just been a little confused.

Even jewelry?

Even jewelry.

For example, my boyfriend recently sent me a bunch of steak and I said, okay.

Thank you.

What have you done?

He didn't say anything bad.

Obviously, that was his way of saying I'm sorry.

What did he do?

Who's your boyfriend?

What did he do?

Yeah.

Who is your boyfriend and what does he do?

What's happening?

What?

Yeah.

I will send you.

Yeah, springs rolling.

You are only close.

I feel like I only heard that.

It only happened once.

I heard it six times.

My boyfriend's name is Mick.

Mick.

Yeah.

And Mick did something bad.

What did he do?

What did, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, he, he cheated on me.

Pretty fucked up.

We started to hear that.

With a bunch of meat.

Wow.

He sent the meat.

And then is that the meat he sent you?

Um, no, he sent me new meat.

Did he arrange the meat?

Fresh meat.

Into a body shape or was it just purely just?

I think it was just a big pile.

Did he apologize to you?

Are you assuming the meat was an apology?

Seems like he was just delivering more meat to fuck for later.

Well, I think I took it as an apology.

And I said, thank you so much.

And he said, well, it's Omaha steak.

And I said, yes, it is.

So I have 12 follow ups.

And I'm gonna start with one.

Um, do you know if he warmed the meat to room temperature?

Or if you fucked it cold or did he go full hot?

Oh, you want a how to?

I think it was scalding hot.

Scalding hot hot.

I was listening to an old love line once about fucking a microwave tomato.

And they don't tell you to do under 10 seconds.

I did 40 seconds.

Oh, yeah.

I've got fucking severe third degree marinara burns.

Oh, that's good gravy.

That's good.

It's good.

It's a Sunday good.

It's a pretty good catchphrase.

Tracy, was he in love with, was, was, was making love with the meat?

Or was this purely carnal?

He said that carnal isata.

Oh, no.

No.

I'll see myself out.

Please.

No need to escort me on your shoulders.

This will be how the podcast ends forever.

Yeah.

Those will be the last words I ever say.

Carnal isata.

Just a dial tone.

Wow.

He said that the meat gave him something I could never give him.

Oh.

And that was, um, just silent.

Just silent.

Just the temperature of 200.

Silence.

Can I ask you a question, Tracy?

Yeah.

Was the meat that Mick fooled around with also Omaha steaks?

Yes, it was.

Oh, that must have been so hard for you because you worked for them.

That's where you worked, right?

This is your pride and joy these steaks.

I thought it was, it was, you know, uh, it's like workplace- That's like workplace sexual harassment.

That was the part that actually made me be like, it's okay.

Cause it was Omaha.

Does he work for Omaha as well?

Can I ask?

He does.

We all work for Omaha.

Oh, you're an Omaha family.

We live in an, um, well, Omaha.

You live in Omaha.

Omaha steaks.

Um, Omaha steaks, $69.95 for 10 steaks.

Okay.

You are, it seems like you're also kind of crying.

$69.95 for 10 steaks.

That's $7.

That's going to be bad.

$69.95 for 10 steaks.

Also, you're a choice of sides.

Mac, cheese, and other- These are two options.

Two things, Mack.

Yeah, if you want mac and cheese, you got to blow both your side options.

It's kind of complicated.

Salad potatoes.

Salad.

Oh, okay.

What do you think?

Salad.

Oh, that's one thing.

Oh, in a cardboard box.

You're just shipping egg salad to people.

I don't want to tell them what to do, but I bet you fucking a hot pile of egg salads better than fucking a hot pile of eggs.

Oh, absolutely.

Yeah.

That's like getting you, taking a bunch of sauerkraut.

Oh, come on.

Come on, indeed.

Oh.

Is that a callback, or are we supposed to jack off to it?

I don't know.

Come on, indeed.

Oh.

Well, I'm so sorry, Tracy.

Come on, this is- Come on, I leaned.

Come on, indeed.

That's correct.

And I was hoping to get out of there without talking about it anymore.

I'm sorry, Tracy.

This is a terrible situation, especially right before the holidays.

Don't worry.

I'm all right.

Tingle bells.

Happy holidays.

You don't seem all right.

Yeah.

You seem pretty fucked up.

This sticks that this guy fucked might have been hot, but whether you're a little bit of a mess.

He's been hot, but what he did was ice cold.

That's a good point.

Dial tone.

Darren, the fuck up that is Darren was reading that off a card.

Well, guys, it's great to see you.

We do have to move on to our next guests.

And this is very exciting.

We talked to him a little bit before.

He went to Johns Hopkins.

I can't remember if he currently is a doctor.

I don't know that we ever got to it.

I am a physical therapist.

Physical therapist.

Oh, Stanley.

That's right.

Please welcome Stanley Jamila.

You remember Stanley.

Yeah.

We were on an episode before.

You're on an episode with Claudio Adoriti, I believe.

Yeah.

And the shaman guy.

The shaman guy.

Yeah.

That's right.

So I'm Stanley Chamberlain.

I'm a physical therapist.

And I am here to talk about physical therapy.

Okay.

Great.

Well, because we barely got to a last time.

We barely got to a last time.

We had a digression, which was fine.

What was it about?

I wasn't on this episode.

I was on the lead and I...

It was about a satanic initiation right at Johns Hopkins.

That sounds very interesting actually.

That's good.

That's important to your whole thing though.

It's not important to your whole thing though.

It's not important to your whole thing.

We dug into it a lot last time.

Are you from Johns Hopkins as well?

No, I'm from Connecticut.

In fact, after going to Johns Hopkins, I went to Southern Connecticut State Medical School, so I could have a more normal medical school experience.

Because your medical school experience got very crazy.

Since at Johns Hopkins it was so crazy.

On the first day, there was a satanic ritual deep by the Earth's core.

Oh wow.

I was like, no, let's have a normal medical school experience.

I went to Southern Connecticut State University.

Yeah, sounds too.

After I graduated and matriculated from Johns Hopkins.

Which graduated and matriculated.

I graduated and matriculated.

Well, you wouldn't do it in that order.

You wouldn't do it in that order.

You went twice?

I went to Johns Hopkins twice.

Four years of a piece?

Yes.

Wait, four years or did you premature matriculate?

Four years the first time and then I premature matriculated in two years the second time.

Huh.

I know you're making a talk about that.

Did you have to go through the second time you went there?

Did you have to go through the same initiation?

Yes.

I hate to get back onto the initiation site.

No, no, that's okay.

Yeah, I had to go through the initiation where I killed people with machetes a second time.

Oh gosh.

For the devil?

Some man who was wearing- It was like a goat head D.

A goat head stag horned man.

Did you ever find out whether it was the devil infecting your instructor or- I never found out.

I used to see that guy around after you.

You should.

Right, it was just- You should find out.

I should dig into it and find out.

I was doing this, you know, the bidding of- Of a dark underlord.

Which I suppose in a way is an event bigger than myself or was I just duped into committing murder for a mundane normal man.

Exactly.

Like the solution to that.

You think- You think- No, I'm not.

He's just a guy.

He's not a normal guy.

You're not a demon.

You're normal.

Helping people with their physicality is nothing compared to like resolving this for yourself.

I guess I could go become a life of a demon hunter, but I'm really passionate about physical therapy.

Yeah.

So I feel like it's a calling to feel like- I feel like it balances out the times that you ended someone's physicality.

I think that I meant to do it so in a way, yes.

I'll be committing good karma for the 10 to 20 people I have mishetted to death in my education at Johns Hopkins.

Fellow students.

What'd you do?

Cut the heads off.

Some of them I cut the heads off, some of them I lapped.

I just hacked at their arms until they bled out.

That's fucked.

Just radical students and it was only the strong survive, say, 10 in initiation.

Did you find in any way that you were kind of butchering them for their meat?

This is really making me think of juicy Omaha steak available for 69, 95, 10.

I don't know if you want to segue over the murder.

Put me down for 10.

I love a good steak.

70 books?

Yes.

I think, you know, if you've never murdered before, and I certainly hadn't, and you're having murdered since only in the two initiation rights.

Okay.

So have you ever killed a patient accidentally?

Yes.

In physical therapy.

Yes.

Okay.

But I don't consider that murder because it wasn't intentional.

I was trying to help the person and I just got to excited.

We've like 10, let's talk about that actually.

Yeah.

Did you kill a patient while you were doing physical therapy?

I had a mailman in with a mild sprain in his calf.

Okay.

And I was like, this seems like a simple massage is all you need.

You know, we just have to let this heal on your own.

Why don't you let me, you know, you probably could just walk around it'll heal.

But why don't you're here?

I'll give you a little massage, work out some of the soreness.

Okay.

One thing led to another.

I would say, yeah, the fact that he came to the appointment, the whole you're here, we may as well do this.

That makes sense.

You know, a lot of people make appointments and not show up.

Yes.

I am huge.

Again, I'm sorry.

Oh, yeah.

For my businesses, it's been up and down.

And a lot of people make appointments and don't show.

Well, Gina, because of your basketball tournament, I'm sure you're, you were pretty sore.

Oh, yeah.

By my clinic.

I need to.

Yeah.

I got folded up the other day by my step down.

You might leave dead.

We need to hear this story.

Yeah.

Whenever you get no charge, if you want to come.

You referred to yourself as being folded up.

Yeah.

My stepdad folded me up pretty bad.

Like a gap sweater?

Well, I wish it was like a gap sweater.

You hide away bed?

Yeah, it was.

He folded me in half once at the waist and in half again at the shoulders and hamstrings.

Oh, wow.

And then in half, the long ways.

So my butt cheeks were completely wide open.

No, the other way.

Oh, yes, that's the worst.

That's the worst.

And then he spun me around and was going, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, in my open ass, like a jug band.

Like a jug band.

Like a big jug band.

Oh my God.

You do that all the time.

Oh, I did.

I never knew the term for it.

But you released the music on iTunes.

It's always the cover of when the wind does.

And they're in it.

So we had a special program where people have been jug banded.

We can, we fold you the other way.

We put a lot of heavy encyclopedias on you to flatten you.

That's what I need.

It works like a charm.

So what happened with a mailman?

So he got a mild sprain in his calf.

Sure.

No, we've already covered this.

This is a friend of mine and he came by and I'm like, he's a friend.

Well, he's a mailman and we've become friends.

I chat with you.

So what came first?

Yeah.

He was a mailman first but I would always chat with him when he dropped off mail.

Okay, so that's not a friend.

That's, you know, he delivered his email.

I guess it was a great deal.

It's been a warm, I felt like we would be friends.

He enjoyed that.

He enjoyed being talked to.

If he stopped being your mailman, would you still, would he still hang out with you?

I think it, we've never done it but I think we could do it.

Oh wait, this is the person you will.

But he's dead.

Okay, sorry.

I felt like we had the vibe that that would have happened.

Did you go away?

He was alive and you didn't kill him and you stopped being a mailman.

Would you still come to your house at the exact same time every day except Sunday?

I would like to think that he'd go out of his way to maintain the friendship.

I used to start planning when he would come by and wait by the mailbox to talk to him.

That is so sad.

Yeah, you're like a dog.

That's very sad.

I guess so.

I mean, I saw this.

What would you plan?

Like what kind of stuff?

I would sort of, I'd be there with like conversation topics that I knew would interest him or I would deliberately have something weird on my face so he would have something to ask it by.

Yeah, the Gorbachev tattoo that you had.

Sometimes I'm like, well, it's a tattoo of his whole body.

This is a tattoo of the full-figured Gorbachev on my forehead.

And on that tattoo, on its forehead is a little tattoo, that actual Gorbachev had.

Okay, but it's a tattoo.

It's not a birthmark.

It's a tattoo that he had.

This is a tattoo.

The birdmark and then he outlined it just so people could see it.

Yeah, Gorbachev got that birthmark tattooed.

Yeah.

Wow.

He started to lose it.

It was like his trademark.

He wanted everyone to know.

He's like, I don't want to win this.

He's like, tattooed the birthmark and then TM'd the trademarked.

Yeah, the trademarked.

Just because a lot of people were getting that same tattoo.

Yeah.

It was like the dentist, yeah, or like the mike Tyson.

I have a question about the mailman.

Okay.

How did he die?

That's mine.

That's a good question.

Did you go to his funeral?

Yes.

So you are.

I felt terrible.

I love this man.

I did not wish to kill him.

I love to him.

I loved him.

You were arguing whether he was a friend or an acquaintance.

You were a relationship.

You were a funeral.

Yes, I demanded too.

Okay.

You demanded?

So they didn't want you to.

No, I was not welcome at the funeral.

The charges were pending.

You think you're the graduate of this man's funeral?

Yes.

The charges were pending or are pending?

They were and are pending.

Okay, so it is still not.

So I'm not a murderer because you were in a certain prison.

You haven't been sent to the church.

You're still hoping for manslaughter.

You're still a murderer because of the initiations.

I wouldn't even call it manslaughter.

I would say it's a crime of passion.

Oh crap.

Okay, how did he?

You started giving him a massage.

He came in and he said, hey, let's- We know the beginning.

He came in.

He wanted to open the door.

Get to the end part.

I'm going to come in and crash and pay attention to my pants.

This is fucking hot.

This is hot.

This is like a Sennemax movie.

This is fucking hot.

He opens the door.

He comes in.

He's got a mild spray.

Yes, we know.

It's mild.

Please.

Cut to- smash cut to, in fact, the part where you're rumm- Smash cut to.

I don't think right now during the writers' situation we can use stuff like that.

How did he get in?

Oh, he walked in the door.

Good question.

Did he make an appointment or was this a walking?

He had an appointment.

Okay.

Then he also- Was it only a real name or did he use an alias?

I never knew his real name.

How did you know he had an appointment?

You never knew his real name.

You love his a crime of passion.

I called him skips.

Did you call him skips?

He had a little skip at his gate.

He would turn on- Not in his step, but in your gate.

He had a jaunty.

He had a jaunty little hop now and then when he would walk.

He'd be, hey, skips.

He's like, you know it.

So you gave a speech in the funeral for a man's name?

I didn't know his name.

Skips is what Scott calls intellectual properties.

What?

It's a heavy work.

I'll just think about that just later and I'll get it after I get it.

I'll be doing the work right now and I'm loving it.

So what- That's what the chalkboard is for?

He walks in.

Yes, we know your appointment.

He has a mild spray.

This is gonna make us friends.

You are not- So you were not friends at this point?

Wait, so you're in the clinic?

He's in the clinic already?

He's in the clinic.

This is the day he dies and you're not friends yet.

I knew that I considered him my lover.

Okay.

Emotionally.

Sure.

So you're a psycho.

You're a psycho.

Could be.

You targeted a disabled man for an emotional affair and then murder.

It could be.

You said he was your lover.

That wouldn't be how he would describe it.

What they taught us at John's Hop Against is morality is extremely simple.

Can I ask you a question?

When he showed up at the clinic to get his massage, did he know you would be his physical therapist?

No.

Okay.

No.

That must have imagined for skips and terrifying.

Imagine for skips.

How terrifying this would be.

How did he get the sprain?

I tripped him.

Oh, okay.

From a distance.

It's like I want to- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

From a distance.

With a blow dart.

Into his calf, he tripped and fell over and then I lobbed a business card at him with the address of my clinic.

Okay.

Ten seconds later.

He walks in.

Ten seconds later.

This happened in your home.

In front of my home is my clinic.

Oh, okay.

So you gave him a business card for the place he was at?

Yep, but he didn't put it together because he was disoriented.

You just thought it was a happy coincidence.

I assume he looked happy.

He was trying to- Did you give him a happy coincidence at the end of the massage?

I told him it was my policy to offer a happy coincidence.

That's where you both accidentally come at the same time.

You jerk each other off and I tried to time it that we both come.

Oh, so new is the robber.

And I'm like, who would have thought that would happen?

That's what you have to say.

That says come together like big or not stakes.

Oh no.

I'll have another ten.

I'm telling you, these are the- He's down for twenty.

Give me twenty of those stakes.

That's gonna be one.

Thirty-eight.

Whatever it is.

I'm good for it.

I'm thirty-nine-nine-nine-nine.

I'm just a men-mo-it-two.

I'm the bobblehead guy, Desch.

You know it, two, three, four, six of one.

Half-dubbers, half-dozen of another.

Are we done?

Yes.

And then you could give it to her.

Oh, I'll give it to her.

Oh, thanks.

It's a dial-up though.

See, you are married.

I know.

Hey, this guy tricked the disabled man.

Okay, yeah.

You're right.

We shouldn't be- He disabled the man.

He had a mild strength.

So what happened after you both achieved climax?

I never got to after him, but I usually- Did he get to the house?

Yes.

How did he- Did he go inside?

He walked up to the door.

Oh, dear.

He opened the door.

He came inside.

Oh.

No, no, no.

He walked inside.

We never got to the happy coincidence.

I would have offered him that.

I was going to end with a happy coincidence, which would have cemented our friendship.

It's not a happy ending.

It's a happy coincidence.

I missed that.

Yes, you did.

What are you going to do?

Another thing you're two mean in and out while on the show.

He is just right.

That's fine.

But we do appreciate you asking follow-up questions.

I have to call back from 90 seconds ago.

It was not long ago.

It worked just now.

It was very recently we established that.

I have to be allowed to think of all their stuff.

Todd's fully a puddle right now.

We need to rehydrate.

Cut two.

Yes, thank God.

He consents to letting me massage his leg.

He's like, well, if this makes it because he didn't know that I did it.

He's like, well, if this helps, because he was scared when he saw that it was me.

Right.

But I was like, hey, I'm an expert.

Just let me massage your leg.

You feel better.

Let's see where this goes.

In med school, you learn that massages are good for blowgun dart injuries?

Yes.

The Johns Hopkins, they were like, massages is usually the first line of defense in most medical problems.

So what reality is extremely subjective?

Right.

Try a massage.

So what happens during the massager after what?

I start to massage his calf.

Sure.

And I'm like, it's happening.

We're becoming friends.

This is going to take us beyond the mailman customer relationship.

You've already jerked off together.

You think you heard it or never happened.

Not yet.

No, I was going to offer it.

Right.

Never happened.

You don't know what's going on?

Roast him.

Drag him.

Drag my ass queen.

You're ass queen.

We do worshiping it.

What's your ass queen?

Of course.

We really want to start talking about ass queen right now.

Radio buttocks.

No, I want to know how this goddamn mailman.

I got excited.

Okay.

And I thought the only, I need this to be a real permanent relationship.

The only ritual that could come to mind for very serious matters is a machete fight to the death.

Okay.

And I brought out a machete.

Oh no.

Lined up my shot.

Just what?

Just one?

He was not armed.

And where's the crime of passion coming?

Because I was excited.

Okay.

And I sliced his jugular vein.

Oh, wait, his jugular vein?

His jugular vein.

And then his jago started spraying it.

His jugular vein.

He was like, oh, my gosh.

Some do car alarms, but most hard cars.

Ho, ho, trespass day.

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, I appreciate that.

The abrupt shutdown.

That is the signature of Memphis, Kansas, we bring our band to a halt.

In the middle of a beat, stop it right there.

Now I know it's- I like that better than the fade out.

I like the fade out of the sheet.

Yeah, it's overrated.

You can't figure it out and end the song.

No, yeah.

We're all done with it.

Let's be honest.

Yeah.

Look for my neck and when I do the cut it, stop on a dime.

My neck.

I like how in that song, one of your signature moves in previous songs was to say, beep and honk.

This time you said, ho and ho.

We did say ho and ho.

Yeah.

We didn't want it.

We just themed.

Yeah.

We changed it there to beep and honk to ho.

Pretty classic Christmas switch-up.

What was the footer on that one?

Oh, that's a Christmas party.

And parentheses, Christmas truck birthday party.

Yes.

Trucks Christmas birthday party.

Christmas trucks birthday party.

Yeah, that's right.

Close parentheses?

Emma, soon.

No, we leave it up.

We leave it up.

That's a period.

That was a big fight between us.

I want to get a lot of punctuation in your footers or other.

Yeah.

Let's go ahead and hit it when it's next.

Before.

All right.

Brandy.

I'm right here, guys.

All right.

Jason Manzuk.

Yeah.

There once was a girl truck who didn't get invited to the truck school Christmas dance.

No one has her shed to stay at home eating Christmas Eve fruitcake made gas.

The most popular truck in Christmas school invited her to the dance.

There's a huge hot joke.

The job Christmas trucks were gonna laugh at her like Rudolph's main friends.

But then the boy truck took off the girl truck's Christmas sweater and realized just how pretty she was.

He learned that you can't judge a truck based solely on its appearance on Christmas.

Christmas is what's inside the truck that matters the most.

You gotta open up the trunk to see what kind of gifts are inside.

Then they both gotta let it snow king and queen of the Christmas truck dance Christmas truck dance Christmas Christmas truck dance.

I got a lot of questions.

The last lyrics are Golders with Peter.

Peter.

Golders with Peter.

When Peter comes home and his little sister runs down and says, number one.

Boy.

Well, doggies.

We did it.

That of course was Memphis, Kansas breeze that we just heard the candy.

We also heard Lily.

Who's Lily doing?

We just heard it.

Shout out to Lily Sullivan.

I forgot.

I didn't write down who it was and I've already forgotten.

And Wilheins, of course, doing his, we should talk about Wilheins' character.

He came in as that character one episode where he said he was a doctor and then because of the questions we were asking him, we got way off track and he never talked about being a doctor.

So this one he talks about and he said, okay, with this character, I'm never going to talk about the thing I originally come in to talk about.

So just ask me a bunch of questions and get me off track.

And so he's playing.

He's the character is now a massage therapist and of course we talk about the malpractice.

So where he accidentally killed someone.

That's really fun to do with Will, the great Wilheins.

He's an incredible improviser.

Literally wrote a book on improvising.

Yeah, man.

So you should read that.

And that was really fun to do and that was the last time that we all were able to do one of those big ones together.

I know.

Do you want to go through the statistics?

Yeah, man.

Let's do it.

You know, I'm in real numbers head.

You really are.

You're in neat silver.

Your head looks like a number.

My head looks like a number.

Everyone hates me.

Yeah.

At one point, people really liked me.

Then they started not liking me.

And anytime I say anything, people do me to shut up.

Almost doesn't seem more than.

All right.

So let's talk about the performers who were on multiple episodes in the top 16.

All right.

We'll go down from the bottom.

Yeah, scream.

And we won't talk about the people who were in one episode, but the people who were in two.

And we won't talk about the people that were in no episodes.

Yes.

The people who ended up twice in the top 16, you have Dan Lippert and Drew Tarver both in two episodes.

Moise.

They're both from Big Grande and the Big Grande Teachers Lounge podcast.

Lily Sullivan ended up in three this year.

Shout out to Lily Sullivan.

Shout out to Lily Sullivan, of course.

Winding up in four episodes, we have Ego Wodum.

Sean Diston, John Gabris and Tim Baltz.

Antigonee Ty.

That's right.

All in four.

Congrats to the four timers.

Ending up in five episodes, we have Jason Manzukas.

Six episodes.

Who do you think has six?

Well, somebody great.

Carl Tarte ended up in, he beat out Jason Manzukas this year.

That was right.

Six episodes in the top 16.

I mean, that's got to be the most.

It is not my friends because coming in at eight, half of the episodes, Paul F.

Tompkins, eight of his episodes ended up in the top 16.

That's my name.

Of course, and that's the person I'm talking about.

Wait, that's me.

Of course it is.

I did it.

You did it.

Can I say I was very, I'm flattered that that happened?

And you didn't even juke the voting.

I did not juke the voting.

I am, I am, I did not, not only not recall how many episodes I did this year.

But I am very privileged to be a part of so many fun episodes.

I had such a great time.

I always have a great time doing the show.

And this is, I've set it before and I'll say it again.

This show means a lot to me.

It is such a light in my life.

And especially in these dark times to have it not only to, to be a performer on it, but to listen to it every week means a lot.

And I'm sure I speak for a lot of people out there who listen to the show that it is something to look forward to when everything, especially when everything's all fucked up.

Well, it's, I have been getting a lot of nice messages here and there about that, about thank you for continuing to do the show.

And I'll be honest, I, there was a point where I was like, I don't know if we can do this.

I remember that.

And it was getting so frustrating that I was, I was like, this maybe, maybe, maybe it's not the end, but maybe we take a year off or something like that.

But it really is a testament to our coworkers here at, at Earwolf.

Yes.

I want to, I want to thank them.

I want to thank all of the engineers, of course, but one person I really want to thank is Kevin.

Kevin, pretty much when the pandemic happened, could see how serious it was getting or how frustrating it was getting and really made sure that everything happened in order to make sure that the show could continue.

Yeah.

He really has gone, but I mean, he's, he's like, we have a very long text chain.

We are continually talking to each other all week about like just things that need to happen for the show.

And it's, he really became hands on with comedy bang, bang over the year.

And this is his final episode that he is going to be working on.

Yeah.

And he is, of course, if you don't know the news, he's moving on to go work for Hollywood Handbook, who is leaving the network and starting their own Patreon.

And I know he's listening to this because this is his final episode.

So he's forced to.

He is forced to, he's forced to listen to me thank him.

But I really do want to thank him.

And I really don't think that the show could have continued on without his help doing it.

So I really want to thank Kevin for that.

Kevin is terrific.

He's very generous with his expertise and he's helped me.

He's just offered to help me out a lot.

Like he's heard me on other things.

Yes.

Talk about having issues with tech and stuff because we've all been having to figure this stuff out in a way that we hadn't before.

And like he'll shoot me a text and saying, Hey, if you ever want me to help you, I thought your sound was good.

If you've if you want any help with any of that, let me know.

You know, he's really, he's a great guy.

Started as he was saying on our R.E.M. or our talking head show the other day that he started out listening much like Sean distance, started out listening and then came to work and.

You don't think they're the same person?

Never seen them together.

I've never seen them together.

I mean, together together.

Fucking.

Never seen them.

That must be the same person.

Now he's not my employee anymore.

I could say I want to see him.

Fuck.

He still is.

Oh, no, the Scraubart.

Oh, I should do that.

See you in D's court.

But good luck to you, Kevin.

I hope that I hope that working for the Hollywood handbook guys ends up being fulfilling and please let me know if they ever drop the stick around you because I'm fascinated because they don't seem to around myself.

Fucking lot Scott.

It's true.

Oh, let's also go through the months.

You know how there were curious clumps?

Yes, January, February, March.

Yes.

Okay.

No, you don't need to list months.

I mean, the.

I thought we were going to go through the months that episodes occurred in.

So this year, weirdly enough, in previous years, strangely, there's an ebb and flow to the show where some months are great and some are off for whatever reason.

We every month is represented on the top 16.

Is that so?

Other than August.

Sucks.

I don't know what happened in August, but all the other months have at least one.

I bet I didn't do one in August.

Let me check.

No, don't.

Okay.

I actually could.

I am going to check.

I'll just see.

For whatever reason, August was not.

And there's a few really good ones in August, but that's just the nature of this year.

It was a strong, strong year despite all of our challenges.

March for whatever reason had three in the top 16.

So that's the one month that had the most in there.

You had the order of the keepers.

You had the Darcy episode with the Olympics.

And then you had the Shawn Disson turtles episode.

Those were all close up together.

So I want to, I've thanked ear wolf the network.

I thank the engineers.

I've thanked Kevin.

I want to thank July.

I'll throw July in there who's.

Why don't you point at me when you said July?

Because we were talking about him earlier.

Thank you.

Oh, by the way, electric guest is also on that last show, the band electric guest.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

And they sang three songs.

And so I forgot to mention them.

But I do want to thank you, Paul.

It's always as much as this is the hardest week of the year for me collecting all these clips and having to listen to my own voice for a week straight.

The light at the end of the tunnel is the fact that we're going to get together and be able to have a lot of fun doing this.

And we've been doing it for now a decade at least.

And so, and thank you so much for being on the show so much.

I will count up how many episodes you actually did.

But eight of yours in the top 16 is nothing to sneeze at.

That's awesome.

I'm very pleased.

So thank you so much for being part of the show not only this year, but the entire 12 years that we've been doing this.

And most of all, I want to thank you the fans.

I really was concerned and worried when all this started to happen that the challenges of the show would turn people off and people would say like, it's just not the same.

I'm not enjoying it anymore.

Tell me whenever you're back in the studio.

And then I'd have to call all of the listeners individually.

But no, it really people have really and there have been sound issues wherever, you know, people's mics looks, I'm a guest.

I'll be frank, have not even turned their mics on and they've had them right in front of themselves.

But yeah, there are sound issues here and there and there's there's things we work through, but people really have been supportive of the show this year and have stuck with it and have even said that this year has been great, which if at the beginning of all of this, I would have said, hopefully people will just at least get through it.

But I am very thankful that people at the end of this year have been like, this was a really strong year.

And I agree.

I mean, just listening to all of these clips, even though the top four are all pre pandemic in the studio.

But thank you to the fans.

I really appreciate it.

And look, we're going to be back next year.

And we're going to keep going and there are no plans to end currently.

We don't know what will happen, of course, with anything, but we'll see what happens in 2021.

But I for one am looking forward to this year being over.

It's over in just a few hours from now.

And we'll be back in 2021.

And hopefully things will look a lot brighter unless you had a great year this year.

I don't know.

Some people there have to be people out there who are like, honestly, this was the best year of my fucking life.

Ellen.

Probably.

But thank you to everyone.

I look forward to you hearing me in 2021.

I was going to say hearing from you in 2020, but I don't hear from any of you.

You just hear me.

Paul, anything you want to say to people?

I want to say thank you to the fans as well, because not just, you know, for being a part of these, for helping for, you know, them voting for these episodes that I was a part of, whether or not they, that was a factor of their decision.

I don't know.

I appreciate it, and I appreciate the people that have discovered me here that have checked out stuff that I've done elsewhere because they liked me on this show that you put me on and brought me to these people.

And I really, I appreciate you for that.

And I appreciate them for exploring the other things that I do.

And it's wonderful to be a part of this community.

It really does feel like this year put a lot of things in like concrete for people in a way of how they feel about things.

And it really, it does mean the world to me.

And I don't want to speak for Paul, but I guess I will, that it means a lot to hear from you guys when you write to us and say that you appreciate the schedule.

Like I really, when this happened, I really tried to up my schedule of making podcasts.

I was like, let's make stuff and have people, let's, let's not only try to put out comedy bang bang every week, but let me do the talking head show.

Let me do the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle show.

I really tried to sort of like ramp up production in order to keep people entertained this year.

So and it means a lot when I hear people say that it is a welcome distraction from the world out there.

It's never lost on us.

It's never lost on us because we have stuff like that ourselves.

Like that's so extremely relatable.

But it helps to hear, you know, it is nice to hear because it's like, okay, good.

This is actually making some kind of difference.

It's more than just like us having fun.

It's, you know, it's making a difference the way other things make a difference for me.

You know, it's like how a doctor can, you know, like cure you of a disease.

Unless you're, unless you're a son.

You're a woman.

Surprise.

You're a woman.

We got our fifth joke in there.

You're so sexist.

You didn't even realize you were a woman.

You didn't realize your mom was a woman.

All right.

One more time.

Before we close up shop.

Here we go.

Look at me and then turned around and now is looking sort of split into difference between me and the squirrel.

Where the squirrel goes.

Where the squirrel goes, of course.

Now looking back at Koolop up in the balcony.

And now one more time around.

Is this the last time one more to go?

One more to go back at the where the squirrel was.

Come on, baby.

Here we go.

Now talk about your anti climax.

Great ending for 2020.

Of course.

That is 2020 in a D's nutshell.

Well, happy New Year everyone.

We'll see you in 2021.

And before we go out, why don't we play one of those songs that Electric Guest played.

This is one of their songs that there's a little sort of Christmas surprise built in there as well.

So that's funny.

We can't have the number one episode have Electric Guest on and not play one of their songs.

So I can't argue with that.

It's as dale as all this time.

That's right.

Beauty and the beast.

We will.

What?

We'll see you next time for our first episode of the year.

Keep smiling.

This is terrible.

We'll never say that again.

Bye.

Oh, they walking around but there's nothing in my head.

Thought I was high shelf.

Guess I'm something else I can see now was misled.

Oh, it's gone.

Took a while to realize it were wrong.

I'm really can find my way in this awful age.

Guess it's not much to depend on.

I'm just waiting on you, waiting on me, waiting on something to come my way.

These days it's hard to know what we live in full.

But I come back and get each day because I want more.

More.

And I know the most but still get harder now.

Cause I want more.

More.

Never know the smell of heat.

But all I know is that I can see.

Too bad.

Big game.

I'm just waiting on you.

Too bad.

Big game.

Myself is making me sad.

I'm barely feeling bad.

Still I'm here awake.

Any of you chasing might come back.

I'm just waiting on you, waiting on me, waiting on something to come my way.

These days it's hard to know what we live in full.

But I come back and get each day because I want more.

More.

And I know the most but still get harder now.

Cause I want more.

More.

Never know this really.

But all I know is that I can see.

Cause so many things.

I feel like I'm drowning.

But give a help but I still haven't found it.

But I still wake up for the hope of what's in stone.

Cause I want more.

More.
