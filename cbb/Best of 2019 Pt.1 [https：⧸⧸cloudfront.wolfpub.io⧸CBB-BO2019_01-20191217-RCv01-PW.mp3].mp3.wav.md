Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang, best of 2019 Part 1.

Not including what we just heard.

Not including that.

Yeah, that is eligible for next year.

Oh, it's like...

We should start voting on cast phrases.

Mmm, slippity sloped you boy.

Yes, true enough.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

This is the best of 2019 Part 1.

My name is Scott Ockermann.

I'm the host of Comedy Bang Bang.

And every year we do this.

Every year, this is the, I believe, the 11th time we have done a best of.

As we just celebrated the 10th anniversary and this is the 11th December, I believe that we have been in existence and therefore my math is correct.

10 plus 1.

Hey man, congrats.

Hey you, or I guess 11 equals 11 is more of what my math was.

11 does.

This is the 11th December.

It cannot be disputed.

11 equals 11.

It also equals 7 plus 4, 8 plus 3.

Yeah.

All sorts of ways the dice can fall.

But now you're splitting hairs.

We're getting into numerical semantics.

True enough.

I guess 5 and 6 is the only way the dice can fall on 11.

Mmm.

Can't do 8 and 3.

Can't do 7 and 4.

Unless you're playing Dungeons or Dragons, my favorite game.

Dungeons or Dragons.

Yes.

Who's Dungeons or Dragons?

And you had to choose.

Isn't it?

This is the game I play.

Which one do you prefer?

The Dungeons or the Dragons?

I prefer the Dragons because at least then you're fighting and stuff.

If you roll and you get Dungeons, then you're just in the Dungeons.

And that is just a coin that you flip.

Yeah.

That you roll sort of like you roll on its side and then it falls either way.

We roll over your knuckles to impress people.

Right.

Just much like Caesar Romero in Oceans 11.

That's right.

Then you roll the coin on the table.

Right.

It falls off.

It always falls off.

Which is so much fun for everyone.

And then the Dungeon or Dragon Master looks at it on the floor and says, oh, you got Dungeon.

You got Dungeon.

Then you wait in the Dungeon until you are maybe paroled or you die.

And you have to go before the parole board every year.

Yes.

The Dungeon parole board.

Yeah.

Every year.

Yes.

So it takes years and years to play.

Yeah.

I've been in a Dungeon for 16 years.

Play with the same guys.

It's great.

Have you ever played Dragon?

No.

I've seen people play Dragon.

I've seen like, and that goes by fast.

Oh yeah.

And it's incinerated immediately.

My friend Billy, he got Dragon.

Is he on the street?

Billy on the street.

That was straight, straight, straight, straight, straight, straight, straight, straight.

And he was having a ball.

Oh man.

And I got Dungeon.

And every week I would come back to the game where we've been meeting the other 16 years.

Yeah.

Immediately you were remanded to the...

Yeah.

I was remanded to...

Remanded, yes.

To the dungeon.

And I would...

So I'd come back and you know, I have my painted figurines and everything.

Sure.

And I would say...

The guard allows those because they're not allowed in the sense.

No, no, no, no.

This is me in real life, IRL.

Oh.

I bring my painted figurines to the game.

Oh, but then the guard does not allow them.

No.

The guard does not allow my character to have painted figurines, he confiscates them.

He smashes them in front of me.

In front of me.

With a big mallet.

Like a Gallagher.

Like the kind you'd find a dragon with.

Oh.

I'm an...

Assuming.

Introduce me.

Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Introduce me as Jason Momoa.

Okay.

Well, every year he's with us, he does these best ofs alongside me mainly because they're fun to do and he's on so many episodes.

He played Aquaman.

Please welcome Jason Momoa.

Scott, thank you so much for having me again.

I love being here.

I love the best of...

Hold on, hold on.

It's me, Jason Momoa.

Have you ever...

Shout out to Game of Thrones.

Jason Momoa speak.

I don't think that's it.

I've seen everything.

I've seen every one of my pictures and television programs.

Remember that one on Netflix.

I was in it.

That one on Netflix.

Love comedy bang bang.

Hey, no man.

I don't think you can keep this up the entire time.

I'm kidding a salad.

Joking.

No, not joking.

I love the show.

Oh, they...

The car goes on first.

Yes.

Jason Momoa.

I don't think you can keep this up the entire time.

Don't you?

I feel like I should introduce the real you.

You don't think I can do it?

I know you could.

You don't think I can do it.

You say you can't handle the truth.

You can't handle the truth.

That is such a charming dialect where people replace TH sounds with F sounds.

It's charming.

It's not abrasive.

It's also what people are dentures to if they take their dentures out.

Is that strange that in England...

Where are from?

Of course, Jason Momoa.

Jason Momoa.

Mary Tilesbone.

I love Lisa Bonet.

I get along well with Lenny Kravitz.

We're mates.

Remember that video of Lenny Kravitz?

Which one?

I know I need to be more specific.

Not let love rule.

No, the one where...

What where this cock came at?

Yeah.

We watch it.

Were you two, baby Jason?

You watch it every year?

Where do you see my video?

Oh, no.

I've constructed some flimsy trousers.

Is there a specific day you watch it?

We watch it with Christmas season like a you log.

We have it looping.

We watch it looping.

On a loop on the TV.

We're looping it.

We're looping it, me old china.

Don't faint for a second when I looping it.

Oh, telemarker's right.

Hey, super bara.

Answer it.

Should I answer it here?

Talk to me.

I tell you market it calls, but once.

Not these days.

Oh my God.

How many telemarketer calls do you get a day?

Thousands.

Thousands and thousands.

One second.

Me mobile never stops ringing.

At a certain point, we're just going to throw these things away or disable the phone parts of them.

Too right.

Tell me about Aquaman.

He's a charismatic figure.

I'm in the movie.

Not the character.

The movie is loud, flashy, incomprehensible, and not seen by me.

Wait, you said you saw all of your movies.

I've never seen a woman.

You're a liar.

I'm a liar.

You are a liar.

Jason Momma, the liar.

Is Aquaman a liar?

Yeah.

You can't talk to fish.

He can't.

Everything that happens is just a coincidence.

Really?

This is the most coincidental movie I think ever since.

I played him.

I played him as a liar.

You played him as a logical liar.

Every time someone says, hey, tell those dolphins what to do, you get it.

I notice you get a nervous look in your eyes and they start darting about.

You know, it's why I look back and forth, back and forth.

And then I say, oh, oh, dolphins.

I think if you've never heard this show before, you're very confused as to what's happening right now.

Do you think the politics is back?

I'm back.

Yeah.

Paul of Tomkins, of course, comedian extraordinaire, rock on tour member of the rock on tours with Jack White.

You played base, but I believe between the years of 2005, 2007.

Yes.

Not with that band though.

Not with that band.

Just at home.

Yeah.

You were a member of the rock on tours.

You didn't play base for them.

I refused.

You were the mascot.

I come out on the big rock on tours costume.

It was just a giant Jack White.

Yeah.

Big foam head.

It was approximately two feet taller than the real Jack White.

Yeah.

And you know what's weird?

It was inside that costume?

Freezing cold.

Usually they're incredibly hot.

Yes.

They get it.

And it's very close.

But this one was it was for the Tomkins movie.

Yeah.

Freezingly hot.

Did you see that?

Did I really close?

I did see that movie.

Why did I see that?

Why did you see it?

I went to a screening with Leo Allen.

Oh, you went outdoors to see us.

Can you believe it?

How is Leo?

I mean, this was years ago.

How was he then?

He was great then.

Good.

Even better now.

Please give him my best.

I hope to see him soon.

I have not seen it.

He lives in New York usually.

Oof.

Can you imagine?

You did that for a year.

I did.

Never again, did boy.

You lived up in the tip of the Statue of Liberty's crown.

Did you not?

Yeah, I did.

I lived in the Crown District.

It is a crown she's wearing.

It is.

Is she some sort of queen or princess?

You don't have to be royalty to wear a crown.

Isn't that funny?

That is funny.

Anybody can wear a crown.

So anyone just off the street including Billy can just go into a store and buy a crown?

Yeah.

You can make your own.

Who cares?

It's strange that they call the part of the head the crown and then you also wear a crown.

That would get confusing.

Two things called crown right next to each other.

It's like if you just said the hat of the head.

Yeah, the hat of the hat.

Yes, he a rock fell on him and he got a nasty cut on the hat of his head.

Yeah.

When he was battling a dragon.

What?

It would be like if you called the pupils of your eyes the glasses.

The glasses of the yeah.

Well, we've talked about it on this show.

Glass is one of the only things that is a noun but describes what it is made of as well.

It's true.

An iron perhaps?

Iron.

Nope.

Iron certainly.

And is there anything steel?

No.

I guess you can't describe a steel.

Maybe a blade maybe a sword is a steel.

Does it describe a steel?

You know, I mean a steel is not a a noun.

Not a steel, but certainly steel.

Steel is but that but that again you wouldn't say like hey that steel is made of steel.

That's just steel.

But are irons made of iron still?

I don't know if they are anymore.

I believe they now the plexiglass.

Perhaps yeah.

What is the bottom of an iron?

If not, what is the bottom of an iron?

The portal one.

Oh, the poet.

Sig of it.

What is the bottom of an iron?

Oh, would you just hit there?

Mike technique, Mike technique, Mike technique.

Hi, I'm Mike technique.

Would you like to learn how to fix this microphone?

Because I need you to.

I'm Skip intro and this is Mike technique.

You know the incredible duo Skip intro and Mike technique.

We do this every year.

The comedy bang bang best of episodes normally.

Hey, what's up people call us the incredible duo?

The incredible duo.

What's up, bad?

That's not bad at all.

I mean, I'll take it.

I wouldn't mind.

I wouldn't mind at all.

Sure.

If you want to call us the incredible duo, we'll be called the incredible duo.

We probably wouldn't argue with it, certainly.

No, I'm not going to talk anybody out of it.

No, I mean, I wouldn't, you know, get in front of a court and hire a lawyer to.

Free in crackers.

Shut it.

And then kick him out of bed.

Hey, lawyer, get out of the bed.

Get in front of a court, hire lawyers, free to crackers.

And into my car.

Billy, he's in the ocean.

He is in the ocean.

Do you think it's the same, Billy?

I think it is.

Carabin Queen on the street.

He's also a kid.

This is a kid who's in the ocean and in the street.

Yeah.

He's a kid in the ocean.

And Billy and goat on the streets.

These are the four billies.

The kid.

Ocean.

Goat on the street.

The four billies.

Four billies.

This is a shirt.

This is what you think so?

I think so.

Let's get the rights to, do you think Billy Eichner's likeness has been trademarked at this point?

I don't think so.

Let's get in early and often.

I'm sure he is neglected to do that.

Yeah.

It's too bad.

Because he's a friend.

But this is business.

This is show business.

This is t-shirt business.

T-shirt friends.

And we have to decide right now on Mike, the spelling of billies.

I think it's YS.

Billies.

So it's up top.

It's billies up top.

Up top.

Party in the back.

Yeah.

Up top.

Party in the back.

Right.

So billies with a YS.

And then there's pictures I would imagine there's two.

It's two by two.

It's like a square.

Yeah, nose arc style.

Yeah.

You have two giraffes, two elephants.

In one square, all the animals that were on nose arc.

Every animal.

Every single one.

So the images are so small.

You have to really get up close to see what it is.

It's like that Jim Carrey poster for, what was it?

What was the dude Truman Show?

That was the poster of that movie.

And it was made up of many little images.

Many little images, but it made one big Jim Carrey.

So it makes- Oh, like life.

We all make up one big Jim Carrey.

Yeah, the many images of our lives make up one big Jim Carrey.

Do you think we're all in Jim Carrey's imagination?

He has a fertile imagination.

You have to agree.

Oh, absolutely.

You've seen his paintings.

Sure.

Yeah.

He's got a fertile and febrile imagination.

Yeah.

Now febrile, that's a word.

I don't know it.

I know what it is, but I don't know what it means.

Okay, let's look it up.

Or let's ask Siri.

Look it up, Scotty.

Look it up.

Siri, what does febrile mean?

I found this on the web.

Febrile means having or showing the symptoms of a fever.

Oh, shit.

Oh no.

I think I'm a little febrile.

My nose is running.

She got exhausted with you asking so many times, then she's like, read it.

I found this on the web.

I tried to tell you twice.

And now I'm just telling you, look it up on the web now.

Now fish for life, asshole.

By the way, we have Kevin over here, chef Kevin.

We have him over here.

We have him over here in the booth and he's texting me answers.

I don't want answers from the likes of you.

I want Siri to tell me.

I'm going to hold up my phone.

Kevin.

I'm going to be a febrile mean.

Let's see if he texts you.

He wouldn't dare.

He would never.

Why did we give him our numbers?

He can contact us at any time now.

Sometimes he thinks I sleep with my phone by my bed because in the middle of the night he'll text me, boo, with a ghost emoji.

Oh, so my phone's out in the bedroom.

I see that next morning.

It's not scary during the day.

Where do you keep your phone in a safe?

Yeah.

At the bank.

So every morning.

Every morning.

You have to go down to the safety deposit box.

Get to go down to the safety deposit box and get my phone out of the bank.

And your jewelry.

And all my costume jewelry.

My, my, your costume jewelry.

Why do you, it's worthless.

Why do you keep it there?

To confuse the thieves, Scott.

Oh, so they take that instead of your phone.

Yes.

Because you can only take so much stuff if you break into a safety deposit box.

But they see me wearing it.

Exactly.

Because the timer.

They see me wearing this gaudy jewelry about.

They think this guy must have.

He's loaded.

Rich.

Then I think about the phone.

They think I have a phone.

I'm not going to steal a phone.

Yeah.

Everyone has a phone who needs it with them.

I want that jewelry.

Exactly.

What the jewelry?

Those pearls falling on the ground.

It's per oh because of Batman.

Oh, the Mark of Zorro himself.

And then Joe Chill came up and he shot us all.

You pounded on the table and is still reverberating.

I don't know whether people could hear it.

I could hear like a, a, a.

Powerful.

I'm trying to make the water glasses go Jurassic Park.

Do you hear it now?

I do.

I thought it was like a noise from outside.

But it was no it's these, it's these coils and everything that might stop doing it.

I'm trying to end it.

It is fun.

You got to admit.

Joe Chill in retrospect, it was probably a name that when they, by the way, Joe Chill is the robber that shot Thomas and Martha Wayne, the, the Batman's parents themselves.

When they picked it, he was like, chill, like chilling or something.

But now it just sounds stupid.

Like Joe Chill.

He's a very relaxed guy.

He's so chill.

Do you remember there was a Batman comic where Batman confronted Joe Chill after years and years and years and years and years.

Yeah.

Ripped off his cowl.

He's like, how would he remember?

You created me.

Like all the guys he's killed over the years.

He's not going to remember these two.

Well, also in that moment, in that moment, he's like, I guess that's what he would look like.

I'll grown up.

I do remember it.

Similar, similar eyes, I guess.

Nose is grown.

But then Batman did not kill him.

Did he?

Did he kill him?

No, I, as I recall, the, the writer wrote himself into a bit of a corner because that, you know, you can't just reveal yourself to be Batman.

And then there's Joe Chill running around going, Hey, Batman took off his mask.

Do you know that Bruce Wayne guy?

The famous fucking Batman.

He's Batman.

So I believe Joe Chill had a heart attack at the site of Batman and realizing what he did and then passed away.

Yeah, sure.

Wouldn't that be nice?

If people, if people had heart attacks and he took off anything.

That's what I was thinking.

That would be nice.

Just take off my clothes.

If you're a tech city.

You can actually whip off a scarf or something and make some of that heart attack.

Excuse me.

Well, I whip this off.

Every year we do this.

If you've never heard this before, it's important to note no one ever asked us to do this.

I, I do recall the first year.

Yeah.

No one asked for it.

And then people said they kind of liked it, but I think the second year we changed the format.

What was the old format?

Well, the first, this is the original format.

I think we've done it 10 out of the 11 years, but the second year someone convinced me to not rank the episodes.

They just said like here are good moments from people or something like that.

So I don't, you all of these, by the way, I believe are kept up for free.

They're not behind the paywall.

We keep the best of out there.

And a lot of people tell me that this is the first comedy bang bang episode that they have ever heard.

So let me explain what the show is madness.

It is sort of.

But I enjoy it.

Let me explain what the look over there.

Huh?

It's the band madness.

Oh, where are they?

Our house?

Yeah.

Here is.

I mean, are we in the middle of the street?

I believe we are.

Billy.

So the, the quads are.

Yes.

All the animals.

All the animals do.

Including goats.

Yes.

Oh, of course.

So they're covered.

Yeah.

Billy Eichner.

Right.

Billy Ocean.

Right.

And then the kid.

Yeah.

And the kid is.

Is, is it a young kid named Billy?

Here, let me ask you.

Let me ask you.

Cogan.

Siri, is there a young child actor named Billy?

He's yelling at it.

Like an elderly relative.

Just a sec.

I couldn't find exactly what you were looking for.

But I did find some of their selections with young and child.

Oh, oh.

Siri.

Siri, whose name is Billy?

Siri, believe that order.

I don't want any of those popping up on my search forms.

You are.

Everything you're saying is turning up on my search forms.

That's true.

Siri, whose name is Billy?

Siri, believe that order.

I don't want any.

Siri, whose name is Billy?

I'm still not sure.

I need to unlock your iPhone.

All right.

Fun with Siri.

This is a whole show in and of itself.

Fun with Siri.

We should do this as a show.

Stitcher preview.

Absolutely.

We just asked Siri things all day.

Absolutely.

Everything is a show.

It started in 2009.

We just had our 10th anniversary this year.

And essentially what it is is I'm the host, Scott Ockermann.

And I have...

I'm the guest, Paul F.

Tomcat.

Yes, currently.

And this is what we do.

We talk to guests.

And this is the best ofs, by the way, are where we put aside the childish things.

And the veil of dishonesty that hangs over the show during the normal year.

Oh, fiddling with that mic.

Fiddling with that mic.

Don't worry about it.

Well, it's making noise.

Well, I'm trying to do things to make it better.

Do it silently.

And every show is normally a combination of speaking to actors and comedians, people in show business.

And they are playing themselves.

And then we also have comedians on who play different characters.

And we don't say that during the show.

We just introduced the comedians as whatever characters they're playing.

And so some people don't listen to the best ups for the first episode.

And they drop in and they think that these people are real people.

But the show is not meant to be...

It's not like a Phil Henry thing where that...

We're pranking anyone.

It's just...

You know, the last time somebody thought that one of the characters was a real person.

It happens a lot, actually.

It...

Quite a bit with... still, yeah.

Kevin's over here nodding his head instead of texting us for a change.

We just get text.

Yes.

Wait a whole second.

Kevin texted me a video.

It texts you.

It's you nodding.

Yes, people still...

Yes, Queen.

People still get confused a little bit.

I heard a lot, especially with your... you do a character occasionally, the famous director of Werner and now actor Werner Herzog.

That's right.

From the Mandalorian.

You've done this for several years on the show.

And people have listened to the show and thought that it was the real Werner Herzog and the real Werner Herzog was very funny.

And they were like, wow, he's a really funny guy.

Yeah.

But it is you doing an impression.

That's true.

And that happens quite a bit.

I would think that the show is so ridiculous that people would understand that people are just fucking around with it, but we fool them.

We got them.

I drag them.

Here's the thing I love.

Getting these people.

Yes.

Oh, when I realized they got me, fell for it.

But that is not what the show is about.

We're not here trying to prank people.

It's just a...

It's just a happy accident.

An improvisational show where comedians come on.

We never discuss what we're going to talk about beforehand.

It's all just in the moment and these conversations come up and we never know where they're going to go.

And occasionally they descend into madness.

Madness they call it madness.

That's madness is theme song.

Did madness have a song?

Yeah, they did.

Called madness.

Yeah, madness.

They call it madness.

Don't do that.

Madness.

What other bands have had theme songs about themselves?

The monkeys, obviously.

Hey, hey, we are the et cetera.

Let's go down to Beatles town.

Let's get down to Beatles town.

We're the Beatles who are clapping around.

You have general public, bad company.

Although, bad company, that wasn't really a theme song as much as they were singing about the concept of bad company.

Is that true?

Yeah, well, is madness singing about the band madness or the concept of madness?

I think they're singing about the concept of madness.

The monkeys were definitely singing about themselves.

We are the monkeys.

Yes.

Hey, hey.

We are the bands who have done that.

No.

We are the monkeys and...

Hermans Hermans.

We are Hermans Hermans.

Hermans, he's our father and we all live in a cave.

He don't get out much.

He's a gorephobic and that's why we live here.

Didn't rhyme.

Hermans Hermans.

That's a very end of the song.

I wish more songs were that length.

Yeah, like...

Not bad, yeah.

When your favorite song comes on, it's like, oh, I love the song, but then it just drags on for two or three minutes.

I like every song for two minutes and then any...

Like, I love it and then to a one, I'm like, ugh.

I hate that.

What are you still doing here?

Songs are like guests and fish.

Mmm.

They expire after three days.

Is that what the saying is?

I like them both black.

Guests and fish and songs.

I love you black guests and I love the movie Blackfish.

Blackfish.

Oh, Oriental City.

Blackfish.

Oriental City.

Oh, Maria.

I'm back in my neck getting dirty and gritty.

By the way, you don't have to be 50 years old to enjoy this show.

I know you said by the way, you don't have to listen to this.

You just are.

You just are in control.

You don't have to listen to this.

If you don't want to, you just are listening to it.

So every year, Paul and I gather around the holidays time and it truly is around the holidays time.

They're undisputable.

Undo...

I mean, uh, Snow is on the ground.

Jack Frost.

That'll hold crafty weather wizard himself.

A snippet of Edo's.

Jason, you're back.

Right.

I love Christmas.

It's when...

Lenny Kravitz, when the whole dong you'll log comes out.

Jingle bells.

Etc.

That's another...

Oh, gosh, golly.

That's another song.

Jingle bells.

Goes on too long.

That's another song.

Jingle bells.

Yeah.

How about a happy birthday?

Another one.

National Anthem.

Now there's three songs.

It's like we have enough songs.

How many songs do we need?

I could believe when the alphabet went up to 26 letters.

Ah.

But that's the thing.

Songs these days.

Every song that comes out there getting sued for being a different song.

We're out of songs.

Just enough already.

At this point we should say we have enough songs.

Let's just cycle through and make different ones.

Look, Mariah Carey just happened this week.

Look at her.

A 25 year old song is now the number one song in America.

That's what we should do.

Just go back through old songs that didn't reach number one and say, this is the most popular song.

That song is old enough to vote.

Drink and fuck.

And rent a car.

Yeah, finally old enough to rent a car.

Who will do you have to be legally to have sex?

Well, depends where you're from.

And depends on with whom.

Hihihihi.

Ula-la sex.

But every...

Ula-la sex.

That's a shirt.

Ula-la sex.

Absolutely.

Ula-la sex.

Everything.

I can say that on a belt buckle.

Ula-la sex.

This person's impressed and thinks sexy.

I mean, I think we forget that it is.

It is so sexy.

It's like...

We're so used to talking about sex.

And sexy things.

Guys, I guess we're used to it, right?

We're used to it, right?

Yeah.

We're used to it all the time.

We're wives.

Sure.

Yeah.

You're constantly having sex with that wife.

It's like having sex every day.

It's like, yeah, why?

It becomes commonplace.

I buy the cow.

Yeah.

When you can instead have sex with your wife.

Yeah.

Between the two?

I'm not my wife.

Then go through the hassle of buying a cow.

Buying a cow.

And then you're not having sex with it?

Yes.

What if you bought a cow and then you could never have sex with your wife again?

And you couldn't have sex with a cow either because that's BCL.

You should do that.

Yeah.

The cow can't consent.

Exactly.

What if cows could consent?

What if you taught...

You know those horses that clomp on the ground in order to say yes or no?

Oh, I know those guys.

So that's...

We can teach horses to consent to things.

And for yes, to for no.

Why clomping on the ground?

We've proved we can teach horses consent.

We've proven that horses can understand English and answer our questions thoughtfully.

So they can answer binary questions thoughtfully.

We can have sex with horses.

Those are the...

That's the one animal.

And if they consent.

If they consent to it.

Yes.

You have to go...

You sweet talk that horse.

Give it a little bit of peanut butter.

Hey, you look gorgeous.

Gorgeous.

Your hair.

Your nude.

Mind if I join you?

There's a shirt right there.

A horse.

And above it says you're nude and underneath.

Mind if I join you.

That's not a bad shirt.

These are good shirt ideas for the holidays.

Well, I see money from these shirts.

Oh, yeah.

I mean, we'll talk about that.

Certainly between the lawyers, we'll get our lawyers involved.

Between the lawyers.

Is that your next movie?

Shut up.

Your next movie.

Oh, fuck.

How does he turn that around when we so...

I know.

Because you, between two birds was your last movie.

It's true that was my last picture.

What movies have you been in?

I can name them all for you.

Okay.

Aquaman.

The King of the Seven Seas.

All seven.

I love how he gets around to all seven of them.

Can we name them?

Yeah.

Atlantic Ocean.

Sea and Ocean.

Dead Sea.

Baltic Sea.

I love Japan.

Wait, no, they're all oceans, right?

Aren't the seven seas?

No, the seven seas.

There are seven oceans.

Oh, God, we're stupid.

But they also call the ocean the sea.

Okay.

So the Baltic...

That's seven separate from the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean.

Right.

Okay.

What's the difference between a sea and an ocean?

A sea is in color.

This is all like rudimentary seventh grade geography questions.

I don't know.

I just don't want to see it.

Like pornography.

What?

Hey, Siri, what's the difference between an ocean and a sea?

And by the way, don't give me those pictures of young children.

You'll need to unlock your iPhone first.

Ah-ha.

All right.

Hey, Siri, what's the difference between an ocean and a sea?

I found this on the web.

Siri, what's the difference between a associate Tennessee?

That's what I thought I said.

A associate's Tennessee.

Yeah.

Siri, what's the difference between an ocean and a sea?

Here's what I found.

Fuck you.

A sea is a...

A sea is a smaller...

A sea is a...

See you next Tuesday.

A sea is a smaller than oceans that are usually located where the land and the ocean meet.

That's cute.

The sea is a smaller than the sea.

And the sea is a smaller than the sea.

Well, that's like, is it a rabbit or a duck?

Yeah, that's true.

Usually it's a rabbit.

Is it a hag or a beautiful young lady?

Yeah.

Is it a six or a nine?

Sixty nine.

Up top.

Five.

All right, so we do this every year.

We...

Literally.

Every year we do this.

And I know we have not gotten to these best-ofs clips.

And I have not even finished describing what happens on this.

This is part of the fun.

Every year you the voters vote on your favorite episodes of the year.

We put out approximately 60 per year and you the voters then take a look at all these episodes, tabulate it in your mind, vote for your top 10 favorites out of all the 60.

And we then rank them.

Well, we don't rank them.

They come out ranked.

You're ranking them separately?

So you've ranked all these episodes?

No wonder you're in so many of them.

Oh, it's nice to hear them.

So every year we go, we run through the top episodes of the year.

We hear clips from them.

And we discuss them and it's a lot of fun.

And we do this in four different long ass episodes with long ass clips.

And look, no one's getting paid for this except Scott.

I do this for free because I love the show.

Okay.

What?

All right.

What do you mean?

I don't know.

I don't understand.

I don't understand any noises.

What do you know?

I don't know why you're saying that on Mike, certainly.

Well, I'm very transparent, Scott.

You are incredibly transparent right now.

You're like the invisible man.

I wish I could be translucent.

Yeah.

That's nice.

I think I like that word.

I think it's a pretty word.

It is very pretty.

It's a lot prettier than Vermillion.

I'll tell you that much.

Oh, Mr. Horn.

God rest him.

He died, you know.

Mr. David Horn.

Mr. David T. Horn.

Do you think that he's down in hell and has horns?

No!

Wait, do you think like he's in charge?

Do you think only the devil himself gets horns?

The guy in charge?

Yeah.

I think that when you're down there burning in hell, they give they throw you a bomb.

I would say.

Why would they give you horns?

So you could go stick them up someone else's bum.

No, I don't think so.

I don't think you're there to be punished.

You're there exclusively to be punished.

This is your Catholicism by the way.

It's true.

I believe.

I believe in a hell where when you get down there they give you some horns and say, look, you're here to be tortured.

And I believe in hell every man will have horns.

If you don't know what we're talking about with Vermillion, that is a story for another day and has been told on a different show, I would imagine.

That was a different day.

Or this show?

I think it might have been the show.

It might have been during the best episodes in the previous year.

Wow.

We'll run through them all.

We'll run through Vermillion.

Mr. Microphone Commercial.

No.

I mean the Simpsons.

Oh my God.

We don't have a song this year.

We don't have a song to sing, but perhaps we'll be hearing some music.

So every year we hear these clips and we count them down from a number which changes every year.

This year it's going to be 15.

We'll hear our top 15 episodes of the year.

What was it last year?

Probably 13, 14.

It always is like 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, somewhere in there.

Why do you do this?

You change the number.

Why do you do it?

Um, what do you do?

It's just lub-boo.

It has to do with the presentation of it.

What I think will make a good episode which, you know, clips would be good in...

Oh, and do I have no sayings?

You have no sayings because I like...

And long time listeners know that Paul F. Tompkins is surprised every year by the episodes which get onto the best ofs and which also in what order they appear.

Well, I'm a very...

Petulant?

Yes.

I'm very vermilion.

Translucent.

Oh, I phone me.

I hope you're not just saying that.

I hope you really think I'm translucent.

I would love for you to be translucent someday.

Thank you.

I hope that at least after you pass on, you somehow become translucent.

I hope it's in the coffin that plays for my funeral that people can come up and see me and say, he's translucent.

Look at the bottom of that coffin.

And the bottom on Paul F. Tompkins.

Right.

Yeah, because I'll be face down.

Face down.

As Prince said, please put me in my coffin.

Please put me in my coffin.

That's how I sleep on a stomach sleeper.

And I want a full showing.

I want people to come and look at me.

Yeah.

Yes.

Has that ever happened in a funeral, do you think?

Where like the first person gets up there is like, what did...

Why did they put the person face down?

Yeah, I'm sure.

And did they talk to someone and say, hey, could you turn them over?

Here's what I'm...

Here's...

Of course, you would think it was a mistake.

Or her, by the way.

Or her.

Do you think when J. Lo dies, she'll...

If she'll want to be face down, like everyone wants to see this.

Right.

Even in death.

This.

Everyone wants to see this.

What would you say, these?

That.

These cakes.

These cakes, boss.

That is a character that Paul F. Hopkins does.

It's true.

And took him out of retirement.

On the live episodes that we did this year, we did about...

I think we did 12 or so shows this year out there in the world.

And we'll be hearing the top one episode of those as well.

We had a separate poll where people voted on the live episodes in which were their favorites.

And we'll be hearing the number one episode that everyone shows in addition to these top 15 episodes.

Very interesting.

Yeah.

All right.

P.R.D. Johnson.

Very interesting.

When did Arty Johnson pass away?

I think...

When did you leave us?

Either this year or last year.

Yeah.

Talk about between two ferns.

He would peek out.

He would peek out between them.

In a Nazi helmet.

What?

He was a Nazi...

This was laughing.

Which was in the same show.

Yeah.

And Arty Johnson was with the...

During the 60s, Goldie Hahn was on it.

The rest.

Rowan and Martin, of course.

Oh, of course.

Rowan and Martin.

They put themselves in the title.

Two funniest guys in the world.

And then Ruth Busy was on there.

Sure.

Alan Seuss.

Richard Nixon.

Richard Gibson.

Richard Nixon was on the top for a while.

They've all seen the clip where he first came on and said Sockett to me.

She?

But a lot of people don't know.

People loved him so much.

He was a cast member for the next three years.

Yeah.

And he did between two friends.

Yeah.

He hung...

He's like, I want to do more stuff.

I have more time.

I want to be dancing in the party scene.

And so, yeah.

He's there in the movie.

Yeah.

He's a background artist in the movie.

Yeah.

By the way, if this is your first episode of Comedy Bang Bang, Little Plug Up Here at the Top, I directed a movie this year called The Between Two Ferns.

No, Between Two Ferns of the Movie.

Little Plug.

And that's available on Netflix and I would like people to watch it.

Let's go put the little plug into your brain.

And Paul Tompkins is featured in the movie.

It is his final movie.

I don't know if I'd say featured.

You're featured?

Here's the movies I was in.

Jack Frost.

Okay.

Voice only and Magnolia.

Yeah.

I remember that.

But you shot your side of the conversation, did you not?

And they only used your voice.

Yes, I did.

Mm-hmm.

Uh...

Chinesh's D in the pick of Destiny.

Okay.

There will be blood.

You're in approximately four seconds of that or so.

Between Two Ferns.

That's it?

Animated.

Oh, animated, sure.

Yeah.

In the movie Tangled.

Tangled?

You have a great part in Tangled.

Did you also segue into the series of Tangled?

I'm also in the TV show as well.

I have to watch Tangled.

It's a beautiful looking show.

Yeah, I gotta see that.

Is it on Disney?

On part work is beautiful.

Yes.

He says with authority.

Anything.

Certainly knowing the answer.

I think anything with Disney and it is automatically on Disney.

I hope so.

Yeah.

I'll check that out.

Anyway, some great films.

Oh, a discography that has lasted, no, filmography rather.

There's a blast disc.

They are all on digital video disc.

But has spanned two decades.

Archival footage in Run, Run, Run.

What year was Jack Frost, your first film?

98 or 99?

98.

So two decades.

An incredible career that has spanned two decades and five films.

One every four years or so.

Yeah.

Incredible.

And it takes a long time to make a film.

I think that's it.

Wasn't I in anything else?

I think it's it.

I don't know.

Hold on.

Siri, has Paul F. Tomkins ever been in a movie?

So rude.

This might be what you're looking for.

Oh.

Hekler.

Let me take care of this.

Siri, am I in any movies?

Here are some movies.

Well, by the way, let's see, Queen and Slim, not in that.

They shall not grow old, not in that.

Dark waters, no, Black Christmas, no.

National Unpoons Christmas vacation, Midway, 21 bridges.

I'm not in any of these.

Siri just said, this might be what you're looking for and brought me the movie Hekler, Gizzy Entertainment.

Oh, Hekler was a movie guy tricked into being in.

Ah, Michael Addis is the director.

Yes, he tricked me.

How did he trick you?

He answered your three questions?

He said it was a movie about a documentary that was about Hekling, but then the movie was really about Jamie Kennedy going up to people who gave his movies bad reviews and saying, why did you do that?

Because reviews are not Hekles.

It's a professional.

Yeah.

Yeah, agreement that we enter into when we make things that people who have jobs with major publications.

Well wonderful.

Well, wonderful.

I believe we have to get to our first clip.

Are we ready to do this?

I'm ready.

You're ready?

Yeah, I'm ready.

I'm definitely ready.

As I said, we are going to be counting down the top 15 plus one live episode and let's get to it.

This is episode 15.

Number one five.

Okay, episode 15.

Here's what you got to know.

Yeah.

Okay, you're setting me up so I can knock him down.

That's right.

Episode 15 is episode six hundred and six and it is called it is from June 17th, by the way, summer, summer and it is called treasure hunting with silver sun pickups.

I remember this episode.

You remember this episode, Paul, because you are in this episode.

I say the role of Brock Lovett.

You certainly did.

Now let's talk about the silver sun pickups are a band here from Silver Lake and great people who are also fans of this show and listened to it regularly and wanted to be on the show and they came and they you can hear them in this clip.

They are talking a lot during it and I don't know that sounds bad like they're talking a lot.

I want people to talk a lot over it.

No, I want people to talk a lot.

So that is a good thing.

Yeah, it's a show.

It is a show and an audio medium where people need to talk a lot.

Otherwise it would be long stretches of silence.

So I'm grateful to them for coming.

I've also heard that they and I just got a message that they want to come and do characters on the show.

No, really?

Yes.

So do people want to hear this?

But maybe let's have them on in 2020 doing characters.

I'll be the musical guest.

Music or guest Paul have Tomkins.

That also happened to me on the television show Joe Jonas who's a nice young man who is one of the one third of the Jonas Brothers.

The musical act and perhaps one fourth of the Jonas Brothers the people.

He came on the television show and he wanted to come back and do a character at some point and then the show ended before he could.

Well, I have a story to tell you about him off Mike.

Oh, good.

I'd love to hear it.

This so in this episode, I was just saying this.

It's very mild for anyone who's listening to this.

Very racy wants to know what the opposite.

Oh, it's mild.

Oh, OK.

It's not spicy.

Do you think mild is spicy?

Because that would explain anytime that I order a burrito and they say, what kind of a saucy do you want?

I'm like, oh, give me mild, I guess.

Too spicy.

I love mild.

It's so spicy.

So in this episode, Silverstone pickups are themselves and Nicky and Brian are there talking.

They also play acoustic songs.

And then we're going to hear three different clips.

We're going to hear a little bit more about this.

I'm going to hear a little bit more about this.

Did you start doing him around the house or how did you?

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

I hear what happens.

I wake up every morning.

After I get my phone out of the bank, I come back home and I say- And this is like a three hour process.

Yes.

My wife is just waking up when I get back with the phone.

And I say- The banks don't open until 9 a.m.

What time does she wake up?

No.

Okay.

All right.

So I say, honey.

I shrunk the kids.

First I don't pleasant news.

Every morning.

Honey, I did it again.

We haven't talked about your whole shrinking ray.

No.

That's like for- I don't like to talk about that.

We don't get in it.

But after that, after I deliver that blow, I say, honey, whom shall I be today?

And she'll name characters, she'll name actors.

If she names a dead actor, I say, can I have the cheat?

And she says yes.

Can I have the whole pass, I call it?

For you to do an impression of a dead actor?

Yes.

And so that means I can use a character that they have portrayed.

Ah, wonderful.

And so she did that.

She said that to you.

She was like, I'm in the mood for a little build, Paxton today.

And I say, would you accept Brock Lovett, his character from Titanic?

And she said, Hall pass.

You got her boyfriend.

And so then what happened?

You just go around the house doing him or- I have to do it all day.

All day.

So every day you're a different person.

For my wife.

So Brock Lovett will hear about what he, not only his history, but also what he is up to now.

And then we are going to hear from the comedian Jessica McKenna, as she is perhaps professionally known.

Perhaps who could say?

Well, Siri could say, but I don't want to waste any more time.

She plays the character of a park ranger Marjorie Kershaw, who I believe she started doing this character because she, Jessica, knows a ton about national parks.

Yes, she does.

She's very fascinated by national parks.

She literally does.

And incorporates all of that knowledge into a character who is a park ranger at these national parks.

So we're going to hear three different clips from this episode.

This is your number 15.

Number one five.

Brock Lovett, welcome.

Where's Brock?

Oh, sorry.

Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

Oh, hi, Brock.

Sorry, I introduced you without you being in the room, but I looked to my right and you were not there.

I'm so sorry.

I saw a puddle in your lobby and I was investigating it for treasure.

Okay.

I can understand that.

You played it?

I did not find it.

You did not find it.

Oh, yeah, I should have asked, but a good interviewer would do a follow up.

I extremely suggest you get better at interviewing.

Thank you very much, Brock.

It's only your second time on the show and you just started this second time.

I don't know whether you.

Well, last time you let me ramble on like an idiot.

You could have told me way sooner that there was a movie called Titanic.

Let me catch people up where the cordal of mayor was thrown into the ocean by some old lady that I had to listen to for hours.

If you have not heard Brock's previous episode, he is a treasure hunter who dives down deep into the bodies of water.

Triple D, baby.

Dives down deep.

And you call it a triple D.

We call it a triple D.

Yeah, which is all it's putting.

Let's go gang.

We're going to triple D.

Right.

Are there any women on your crew or?

Yes, some.

Okay.

Don't be so.

Yeah, thank you for the second time.

Now when you were on the show last time you talked about the court.

The cordal of man.

The heart of the ocean.

This necklace that you were in search of.

This necklace.

So dismissive.

Well, it's it's precious treasure.

It's precious treasure that you had been in search of for several years.

Several years.

And you did not know that there was a movie called Titanic, which had a fictionalized version of you.

It was hidden for me.

People went out of their way to hide this from me.

Where Rose is at her name.

Yeah.

The old woman.

The old woman Rose.

She Rose, whom in real life you would befriended.

Yeah.

She hid the fact from you.

She became one of my best friends.

She hid the fact from you that she threw that necklace into the ocean.

Yeah.

They captured that on film.

She not only hid that she had it the whole time.

While you were talking to her, you had a long conversation with her.

Yeah.

She could have opened her her flowery shirt and shown you her her decolletage.

I was wearing a hat.

I don't know if you're wearing a flowery shirt.

Well in the movie, I believe she was.

Oh, the movie again.

You don't have to ask me how I know something.

It's all in the movie.

Well, I'm talking about my real life.

What was she wearing then?

She's wearing a flowery.

Look, already happy.

I am happy.

I'm normally pretty happy.

Is that true?

No, no really.

So you found all this out.

Did you go back and watch the movie since the last episode that you did?

Oh, yeah, I did.

You did.

It's a three hour, approximately 180 minutes.

I mean, this is like, you know, three and a half silver sun pickups record.

So much for hours.

I tried four hours.

Did it?

Why?

Did you keep pausing it and going to the bathroom?

Yeah, I kept doing that.

Not even to relieve myself or anything.

Sometimes I just pause it, go to the bathroom.

You just hang out in there and just stand in there and think.

Treasure.

Wouldn't you even turn the light on?

Always think about treasure.

Yeah, good for you.

Are you ever in your restaurant?

Thank you.

No one ever sees it that way.

Good for me for always thinking about treasure.

You ever in your restaurant and you're like, let me just reach down into the toilet and see if there anything locked up in the drain.

I've been down that road.

I finally trained myself to realize no one's coming in and putting treasure in.

It's my bathroom.

No one's ever leave a little treasure in there.

If you know what I mean, I don't know what you mean.

Oh, I'm talking about taking a huge dump.

Yeah.

Thank you, Mickey.

That's not treasure.

Well, one one trash.

Look, I like to joke about a lot of stuff.

Treasure is one thing.

I don't like to joke about treasure.

I do not like to joke about treasure.

I apologize.

I hunt it, you see.

I do know about you.

So you saw the movie.

What was your reaction to it?

Didn't like it.

Yeah, I can imagine.

I didn't like it.

Beyond just the parts where they were truly concealing from me, things that had happened, made a fool out of me.

Sure.

I don't know.

I just thought it was corny, long.

Well, it was a romance movie.

That's fine.

But do you have romance in your life?

I mean, sure I do.

Are you seeing anyone?

I was seeing the roses granddaughter.

You were?

I heard for a while.

Yeah.

Wasn't I?

I don't remember.

I don't recall.

I think that I was.

Georgia class.

Is that a Brady Bunch treasure?

Yes, it is.

Brady Bunch's treasure.

It's TV treasure.

That's right.

So you didn't like, how did you feel about the portrayal of Bill?

What's his name?

Bill Paxton.

Yeah, he's.

Rest in peace.

Yeah.

How did you feel about his portrayal of your, I mean, just listening to you and seeing that movie, I think it's pretty close.

I thought, well, I guess, I thought he was, you know, he did a good job with what he was given.

Right.

He's physically, he's a lot different than you.

Yeah, that's right.

He's way shorter.

Right.

I mean, one of the things that makes me a great treasure hunter is I'm almost seven feet tall.

So if there's ever an ocean that's eight feet tall, like you're able to reach down in there.

Yeah, no problem.

Yeah.

An eight feet tall ocean.

I wish it was always.

That's always challenge for me.

Are they always deep or are they sometimes tall?

No, they're tall.

There's like, uh, there's some really tall ocean.

That's treasure hunter lingo.

And that's how they hunt mostly.

They just take their long arms and dive into the, right?

It's a lot of, that's where it starts is you just reaching the water.

It just does.

It's your hand around.

Yeah.

What's the first treasure you ever found?

First Trevor, obviously it was a doubloon.

Of course.

Where were you and how old were you and why were you and when were you?

It was Detroit, Michigan.

Detroit, Michigan.

What bodies of water around there?

The Great Lakes.

The Great Lakes, of course.

Yeah.

So it was at one of the Great Lakes.

It was at one of the Great Lakes.

Which one?

Lake Michigan.

Lake, oh, of course.

That tracks.

And we were there on vacation.

My family and I.

Also wait, were you young or were you married at the time?

Which family?

Your parents or your wife?

My parents.

Your parents.

Yeah.

How old were you?

I was seven years old.

Okay.

And I've reached my hand into the shortest part of Lake Michigan.

Sure.

How tall were you then?

Because I mean, when did your growth spurt happen?

I was five, nine.

You were five, nine, seven years old.

Wow.

Okay.

And I reached my hand in the short part of the lake.

It's outside.

Yeah.

That's right.

You've been there.

Yeah, yeah.

The short side.

Sure.

And I came up with a shiny doubloon.

Wow, doubloon.

Who had left it there?

I guess some Spanish galleon must have sunk in Lake Michigan.

Wow.

Amazing.

And that was the only one that was there?

Or did you try to scoop out anymore?

I tried to scoop out some more but I was cruelly ripped away from the lake by my parents.

No, why?

They didn't believe in treasure.

Did you not show them this doubloon?

I just doublooned.

Of course I did.

My father cast it back into the lake, into the tall part.

No, the tall part?

I was never going to do it.

It's probably still there.

Probably the end of the way to get in the top.

Out of respect, I've never gone back in love.

It might still be there.

No, I'm sure it is.

Oh my goodness.

Why did you find it?

I would have heard about it.

Had another treasure on her.

Obsconded with it.

Do you guys keep up with each other?

All you treasure hunters and how many are there out there?

We keep tabs on each other.

How many treasure owners are there?

Probably eight million.

Wow.

It's a big community.

Yeah.

That's a way bigger number.

I would imagine.

Yeah.

Are there rankings?

Like are you...

Everyone's equal.

Leaderball.

Okay.

In the eyes of all other treasure hunters.

That's right.

You are all eager.

Whether you are a very successful treasure hunter or you just can't catch a break, we're all out there doing the same thing.

Stick in our arms in the water and try to get treasure.

Scott, no, it's so good to see you.

It's great to see you.

I did start my parkdom at Pinnacles National Park in California.

Right, yes.

And I like the applause.

Reminding me of the Pinnacles, which you'll like the jazz hands of the earth.

But then as you recall, I was transferred to the least visited park.

Ah, yeah.

I did not recall.

The gas of the Arctic.

Yeah.

But thank you for reminding me.

Oh, no, that's for the listeners.

As you recall, I was transferred to the gates of the Arctic where...

No, very few visitors.

That's one of the least attended parks.

The least attended part.

It's the very bottom of the list.

That's right.

Okay.

But good news, Scott, I got another hot transfer.

Oh, congratulations.

Yeah, it's great.

Just in time for summer.

Where are you now?

You're from Marjorie.

She's down at Dry Tortugas.

Dry Tortugas.

I guess I don't know that one now.

Dry Tortugas.

I might be on board already.

Oh, well.

He likes things sopping well.

Especially treasure.

Well, we are surrounded by water.

We're part of an archipelago.

Oh.

Which as you know, as you will recall, is a collection of islands.

Oh, of course.

Yeah.

That was for the listener, Scott, as they recall.

Can I ask, in these archipelagos, have you ever seen the glint or the gleam or the glistening of gold?

Well, you know, this area, it was originally discovered.

Well, that's a loaded word found by someone from the west.

Yes.

Constellione.

And there's so many...

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, that's right.

I didn't want to get ahead of myself, but, you know, legends of shipwrecks and the like.

So all those kinds of...

Big name of the treasure game.

Oh, yeah.

I have learned all this because there's not...

Though I have a slide up to still not a ton of visitors to Dry Tortugas.

There's still really how...

Well, it's hard to get to.

Where exactly is it?

I'm trying to imagine.

It sounds like in Key West, but you kind of have to be on, there's like a one ferry or you can take your own boat or a sea plane.

It's only getting about 50,000.

Wow.

Those are the only ways to access.

That's right, but we're a big hot spot for diving, snorkeling, or people who want to visit unfinished fortresses that were used as prisons during the Civil War.

Oh, I can only...

Well, I can only...

Yeah, I can only imagine unfinished prisons.

There's probably a lot of treasure on these.

It would be less depressing, I guess, to visit an unfinished prison.

Yeah.

Well, it did hold prisoners, but the fortress isn't finished.

Oh, I see, okay.

Let's see.

Like, we were like, oh no, the Civil War's happening.

This is good enough.

Yeah.

So not only were they in prisons, but they...

They had to reside in a place that was unfinished, that they were constantly looking around.

Yeah, can you imagine brother fighting brother?

Hmm.

Do you see that?

Does the name mean dry turtle?

The tortugas does mean turtle, yeah.

So I guess it's...

Well, you know, we, the fort, our party's dry.

Well, I thought it was like three, like, einsfied dry.

Oh, it was timeless thinking.

Oh, that would have been...

Three, three turtles, oh.

That would be what...

If we had it, what is that?

That's German.

The three turtles.

Yeah.

The first one was German, and the other half was Spanish.

Yeah.

Wow.

You can sound like a clue.

It might be a clue.

Does that feel like a clue?

Does it feel like a...

It feels like a treasure clue.

I'm mixing two languages like that, yeah.

So what are your duties now at the new place?

I mean...

Thank you for asking, Scott.

Oh, you're quite welcome.

Wow, what?

It literally is my job, but I always appreciate someone...

Let's see, let me just say thank you.

Okay.

Thank you for asking.

We're very...

One of our most polite guests.

Well, as you know, Scott, I'm sure you know, or your listeners recall, the dry tortugas, we don't sell any beverages or food.

So...

Ooh.

Okay.

It's very hard to camp there.

Is that to keep the turtles dry?

Yeah, I got to keep those turtles dry.

Are people allowed to bring their own in?

They are, Scott, and that is encouraged so that they don't go hungry or thirsty.

And you know, you don't want to get into one of these situations where you think you can say it with me drink the salt.

Drink the salt water.

Has that ever happened to you, Brock?

You ever drink just a big gullet full of salt water?

I mean, not on purpose.

But I mean, when you're down there in the deep, I can only imagine that sometimes I take in.

Well, I'd be dead, I think, if I was way down in the deep.

You ever get the bends?

Yeah, I've gotten the bends.

It's kind of great.

Yeah, in what way?

It's very euphoric.

It's raptures.

That's where they call raptures of the deep.

Oh, you know, and then as that...

Right, that's the clue that you're about to die.

Yeah.

Because I experienced this when I was at the gates of the Arctic when I almost froze to death when I was just doing my rounds.

Oh, right.

And one of the last things that happens is you strip off your clothes and run naked euphorically.

Wow.

I was doing that and I thankfully was rescued by the only other employee.

But embarrassing to explain my lower back tattoo.

Oh, what is down there if I may be so...

Oh, it just says proud Methodist.

But as you know, I don't like to talk about it.

I believe in a separation of church and tribal.

In God keep that in trouble.

I am a federal employee, so please don't ask me about my faith.

I do believe in a separation of church and state.

But my lower back tattoo says proud Methodist.

Right.

And while you were on the job, we're to come up to you and ask you any sort of religious question.

I would say thank you so much for your interest, but I cannot answer any of these questions where I'm currently on the clock as a federal employee.

And no, I do have a deep-seated faith.

I do believe in a separation of church and state.

Would you slip them your card in order to call you off hours?

Oh, that's a good idea, Scott.

I'd like to have a card just so I feel more official.

Can I ask you a question?

Of course.

How often do our people ask you religious questions at the gates of the Arctic?

Well, at the gates of the Arctic, I got it a lot.

Really?

Because they were looking at the vastness of our landscapes and sort of wondering about the marvels of the universe and a lot of God searching there.

Yeah, it makes sense.

And the pinnacle is almost none because I was too busy talking about bees.

And then now at the Dry Tortuga is sort of a midpoint because people are seeking treasure.

Some who seek treasure seek it of a mental clarity variety.

Yeah, I guess that's a truth.

From a higher flame as well.

My bad treasure.

You might be a treasure.

I feel that as a treasure.

Yeah.

Well, I like to keep things clean.

In the kingdom of heaven, that must have a lot of ethereal treasure.

Oh, I was told there was a lot of real treasure up there.

So then why aren't you committing suicide like immediately?

I mean, that's why Russia.

There's plenty of treasure here on Earth to find.

What kind of a thing is that to say to someone?

I'm just wondering.

Can I ask you?

Can I ask you because this is how I feel when I'm exploring.

Why don't you commit suicide?

I don't think I've ever asked a guess that.

I hope you won't ask anyone else.

Yeah.

I'm glad I was here to see that.

That was rough.

This might be neither here nor there and maybe too late.

And I don't want to open up these wounds.

But have you watched the alternate ending to Titanic?

No, what?

So on the DVD or something?

There's an alternate ending.

DVD there is.

There are cut scenes.

What happens?

I watched it on VHS.

Three tapes.

That's right.

It's a long one.

Bill Paxton actually finds her before she drops it in and says, stop, stop, stop.

And then holds it in his hand and says, you're right, I never got it until now.

And then he throws it at him or he gives it back and he's like, yeah, I didn't let the stories get to him.

Did that actually happen?

Just make my blood.

No, it didn't happen.

What are you talking about?

Did you get permission?

So why would he film it?

I guess it's just some of that Hollywood bullshit.

I just think, you know, it might be worth seeing if that feels closer, but there is a version where, and it kind of retroactively makes you understand why Bill Paxton acts in that movie like the movie is about his arc.

Okay.

Because he has a resolution of him understanding that maybe treasure, maybe his.

Sometimes treasure should not be taken.

Right.

His singular pursuit of the treasure may him forget that a lot of souls were lost at sea.

You don't feel that way.

Well, honestly, my biggest gripe with the film is they shifted the focus off of treasure hunting.

Yeah, I agree.

So you might not.

I don't think it's flashback.

You don't like this version.

I agree.

Oh, come on.

You don't do that in the shower.

Try to make that steam hand be all cute by yourself.

See if you can make it look exactly like the steam hand.

You know, the one's done that, of course.

Yes.

Of course.

Only when you buy a stock.

Of course.

The only thing interesting about them fucking in that car was that it was on a boat.

Yeah.

A car on a boat.

How do you think about that?

I admit that's pretty rare.

Yeah.

Hadn't had.

Right.

Yeah.

Hadn't have the children's story.

Wow.

You know, Marjorie, I come to think of it.

You know, if you ever wanted to transfer and find a new job, you could maybe work for a Brock over here in his underground treasure hall.

You could be pointing out the different treasures.

You could do worn people away from diving into the balloon pool.

It would be very exciting.

It would be different.

Direct people to the giant penny.

That would be.

Do you find a giant penny like that?

There's a treasure.

You're going to talk about that.

Did you know what asked me about it?

Did you find it in a different underground cave?

Yeah, I did.

Was there a Robin costume and a glass case down there?

Like a bird?

No, no, like a red and green and yellow costume.

I don't know what you're talking about.

They've brought it.

They said a giant penny, playing cards.

What about a dinosaur?

There was a dinosaur.

Okay, yeah.

I assume that was a dinosaur.

Just got trapped there.

This is a different guy's cave.

Wow.

It would be hard for me to leave the park system, Scott.

I do love it very much.

Well, you would be able to talk about religion, I would imagine.

Oh, man.

We love talking about religion on the boat.

Well, that could be good.

But I could also just try to get stationed at like Big Bend National Park.

Big Bend.

Not Big Bend.

That's a totally different.

That's not national.

No, no, that's international.

And that's just a big old clock is what that is.

Big crack.

That's a big clock.

You're not interested in that?

No, no, I'm more interested in the natural wonders of the world.

So that's a game where this treasure might not be such a perfect fit.

Although Mount Rushmore is a man made wonder.

But not a national park?

Scott a national monument.

And I guess carved out of a...

She's shutting you down again!

Rock in your face!

Oh, man.

It's just my job to gently know about parks.

Which ones they are?

Well, Brock.

They have facts about them.

Can't leave that.

Brock, how much would you pay for salary wise for someone to do that for you?

It could be a nice kind of weekend gig for me.

I could, you know, do it on Saturdays and Sundays if I could get transferred to Big Bend.

I'd be willing to match your salary from the national park.

Whoa!

Just for the weekends?

Yeah.

And benefits?

So you'd make double the money?

No wait, I mean, for like...

Oh, for pro-rated.

Yeah.

Oh, I see.

You make for your full-time job.

You guys what it sounded like?

Well, it would have down in like that.

Fuck you, Brock!

You, Scott!

Guys, guys, guys.

You know?

Relax.

Every once in a while, a guest will come on here who's just an irritating jerk.

Are you out of your mind?

Look, what is...

Listen to the shit that you said to me.

How dare you?

You can't handle the truth.

Thank you!

I don't know who you were talking to.

Me or him.

Yeah, who you're in there?

I just need that.

No one can.

You love that in the air.

You're just yelling, so I just said something.

So you wanted to yell as well?

It felt right to me.

It felt right.

Number one, five.

All right, here's my filmography.

1998, Jack Frost.

I played audience member.

1999, Magnolia.

I played Chad from Seduce and Destroy.

Voice.

2000, I played Sal in Sham.

2002, Safari Guy and TV in the movie.

And Ronnie Ron.

Some of these are just shorts.

I'm not going to...

Anchorman, Legend of Ron Burgundy, 2004, Cat Fashion Show MC.

Then they did an alternate version of Anchorman called Wake Up Ron Burgundy, The Lost Movie, and they used an alternate take of my same performance.

Then we go on to...

I'm excluding shorts.

Tenacious D in the pick of Destiny.

2006 played the open mic host.

Then there will be Ludd.

2007, where of course, save the role of Prescott.

Then I guess I was in The Informant in 2009.

I played FBI special agent Anthony D'Angelo, a person who actually existed.

I had another voice roll in the 2010 movie, Drones.

I played Jafe.

And let's see, Disney Tangled.

2010, I played Short Thug.

That's right.

And then there's some things that I didn't realize that I was in.

Like they made a...

Oh, Jason Nash is married.

2014, Dr. Glenn.

That was a web series that got edited into a movie.

Does it count?

I don't know.

Then Kill Me Deadly from 2015, I played Jaime.

And my status is listed as rumored.

Well, I can confirm that rumor.

I was in it.

Then the Thrilling and Metrorower concert film from 2015, I played the role of Frank Doyle.

When I was in a movie called Helen Back, I played a annoyed lost soul.

It was a voice roll.

I came out in 2015.

Hey.

Yeah.

What's up?

Have you come back from the clip without me?

Yeah, I was just reading my filmography.

These are the movies that I've been in.

Oh, okay.

How long have you been doing that?

Since you've been gone.

Okay.

Did we miss any in the...

When you...

We missed a few.

What do we...

I'm just a feature length.

Do you think Kevin Smith makes a jolt film?

You like that one.

You're really...

You got me very surprised.

But also, I remember his jorts that were just above his ankle.

Anyway, 2019, I played burnt me a payday in between two firms.

I was burnt millipede.

It's spelled millipede, but it's pronounced...

It's pronounced me a payday.

It's not a...

No, that's also the name of my character on the neighborhood listen podcast.

And that's all my movies.

So which are the...

I was out of the room.

Certainly not doing anything weird.

Well, certainly not.

But what were the ones that we missed?

Can you read...

There's a few.

The Anchorman, of course.

Oh, yes, of course.

The Enquorman.

Oh, right.

Oh, yeah.

You missed some big ones.

You missed like your biggest one.

I missed some bigies.

All right.

Well, look, that was a great clip and series of clips.

Was it not?

It was a great clip and series of clips.

Very funny stuff.

All right.

We need to go to a break.

Come back, we are going to have your number 14 on the countdown.

This is exciting.

We are one episode in.

I think we've been going in out.

All right.

We'll be right back with more Comedy Bang Bang after this.

Be for the sea, baby.

Comedy Bang Bang.

We are back with the best of 2019 part one of four.

This is the first episode of four that we will be doing.

And we just heard the number 15 on the countdown.

And it's hard to beat that one.

It is hard, but I believe we'll beat it approximately 14 more times.

This is a good concept for a movie, by the way.

A guy who has only allowed a certain number of masturbation and when he gets a certain number of masturbation.

And it's got to be the title, by the way.

A certain number of masturbation and a Murphy and Eddie Murphy.

By the coward, Robert Ford.

All right.

Let's get to it.

This is your episode 14.

Number one, four.

All right.

Episode number 14 is actually episode 614.

Well, then why did you say it was episode 14?

That's a bla- you were 600 off.

We should at some point do a maybe win the show ends in a couple of months.

We'll do a best of where people vote on all time episodes.

That would be fun.

Jesus.

And we'll rank every single one of the episodes.

And so there'll be like literally a number of 600.

Oh my God.

I don't want to be on the very dead last one, which I know I will be.

This is episode 614 from August 12th.

Summer.

This is an episode entitled Bean Dip and Randy Snuts Return.

Oh boy.

That's what I said.

Oh boy.

Now this is, this was an episode to promote the HBO.

Look, I was going to say television series, but it's not TV, it's HBO.

That's a close one.

Woo.

I would be excommunicated from show business had I said that.

Defrocked.

But this was to promote the HBO series, The Righteous Gemstones, which came out this year and was very, very funny and perhaps even more than funny.

Touching and dramatic and cool, I would say as well.

And just funny.

And okay, yeah, it was just funny.

But three of the stars came on this show and we have of course Adam Devine, who people know from sitting right in front of his name.

Alcoholics and Pitch Perfect as well as The Righteous Gemstones.

No, he signed his name.

Adam Devine, a D.U.M.B.

Devine, right?

Okay.

It was a joke.

So did Adam Scott.

He changed his name to Adam Scott.

Adam Scott.

Who do you think did it first?

It's hard to tell.

It's really hard to tell because none of them put, by the way, this is a parody of the other persons.

What if we're done?

We're not going to date.

But what if we're done?

What if we're done?

We're done.

Did that.

Did that parody of the other persons?

We're done.

Did that in his songs.

By the way, this is a parody of, it was in the title.

Then he wouldn't have to pay the rights?

Yeah.

Very use.

We heard a story about somebody who produced a well-known person who produced a comedy show.

Y'all say?

Comedy special.

No.

And included in the comedy show were a number of song parodies for which they did not get the rights to the songs.

Right.

And then somebody pointed out to them, after it was all shot, hey, you didn't get, did you get the rights to these songs?

And they said, no.

And they said, well, you need to get the rights.

It's like, but they're parodies.

Yes.

But you still need to get the rights.

Well, we're at Al doesn't get the rights.

And then somebody had to say, yes, he does.

So none of those songs ended up in the comedy special.

Weird.

What a weird story.

Yeah.

And so, and how would we know whom that is about?

There's no way to tell because I could just watch comedy specials that don't have parody songs and there'll be any of them.

It's probably John Mulaney.

Although his new one, by the way, coming out very soon and maybe perhaps even out right now, not at press time, certainly, but probably does have parody songs.

So who knows?

But probably does.

I would say it probably does.

Why would you say it probably does?

I think it has music in it.

Maybe not parody songs.

Yeah.

I don't know.

I don't know what the format is, but it's like a anyway, we're getting wildly off topic.

Also Tim Balton, Edie Patterson from the Righteous Dems gemstones who play boyfriend and girlfriend in that show.

So funny in the show.

They also were there.

So this is now Edie and Tim have been on the show quite a bit.

Edie has always played a character called Bean Dip.

Every single time she's been on the show, she plays Bean Dip.

Tim plays a lot of different characters.

Tim is someone that we got to know on the television show.

That is a television show, not an HBO show.

That's right.

Bajillion Dollar Properties.

Which Paul F. Tomkins here headed up the cast and Tim was also in the cast.

Number one on the call sheet.

And Tim was number three.

Tim was number three, was he?

Really?

Who was two again?

Tony Newsom.

Tony.

If anything should happen to me, she would become number one on the call sheet.

And we pray something does not happen to you.

I pray every day.

But if it does, we should look to Tony first.

Every day I wake up, before I go get my phone from the bank, I pray, please don't let anything happen to me.

I like life.

And life likes me.

So on this episode, first of the three of them talked about the Righteous Gemstones for a while.

And then Edie came on as this character Bean Dip who is an insane person.

And then, and we will hear her in the clip.

And then the second clip we will hear when Tim comes on, he is playing Randy Snuts who is a recurring character that he has done on the show.

I think based on a person he knew from childhood and has a very unique way of talking and a unique vocabulary.

Scandalous.

Scandalous behavior.

So we will be hearing two different clips from this episode.

This is your episode 14.

Number one, four.

We have a guest on the show that has been on a few times before and she hasn't been on in a minute.

I don't know where she's been, but.

It's been a minute.

But she is as far as I can recall, she was the owner of the W Hotel.

Wow.

That's why I'm on the W Hotel.

She's an entrepreneur.

She has several side hustles going on.

Please welcome back to the show Bean Dip.

Hey, everybody.

Hey, Bean.

Hey.

Do I call you Bean or Bean Dip?

You could call me Bean Dip or Bean.

Okay.

Mrs. Dip or Mrs. Dip?

Uh huh.

Call me Mrs. Dip or Ms. Dip or Bean or Bean Dip.

Doesn't sound like you're particular.

Yeah.

Any of those names are cool.

Hey, just don't call me ma'am.

Don't call you ma'am.

Okay.

Please don't.

Why would, does that have some connotations for you?

Look, I'm trying to make friends with people.

I'm not trying to be formal.

I'm trying to be friends on a peer level.

I'm not trying to be like, oh, hey, sorry, ma'am.

Go eat the dick.

Okay.

Yeah, I get that.

By the way, this is Adam, Bean Dip.

I know.

We know each other.

You guys know each other.

I stayed at a lot at W. So we've ran into each other in the lobbies.

Oh, okay.

Now you just own the Los Angeles one, though.

I own the Los Angeles W.

Yeah.

And I stay there.

I don't, I don't like to sometimes, I'm like, I don't want to stay in my house.

I have a little staycation.

I got it.

And then I go down to the W.

And can we talk about how hard it is to find a light switch in a W?

We can talk about it, but we're not going to do nothing about it because I need those lights dim when we, let's get real out of the vivance trying to act like, oh, everything's cool.

I go to the W sometimes.

When he comes there, we keep the lights low and we kiss.

You guys have kissed before?

We've only kissed the one time.

It's not a big deal.

It's not a regular thing that we do that.

It was just one time.

Just the one one time.

If it's two, that's a regular thing.

The thing about being is the sexuality that she possesses is it's off the charts.

It's off the charts.

Yeah.

To the moon and back.

It's to the moon and back.

And was this part of being, I remember one of your kind of side gigs that you had was you were kissing people for money.

That's right.

And for money.

And I get, yes, I get it thousands of dollars.

Yeah, he paid me thousands of dollars.

We had an appointment.

I gave him a kiss.

He paid me thousands of dollars.

And I have to block his number on my phone, maybe.

I just want it.

I can understand that.

I mean, being, we've never described your physical appearance, but it's more than that.

Well, let's get into it.

Yeah, let's get into it.

I'm very sorry about it on my face.

To a degree that is just like, I mean, I mean, so it's so pink.

It's like what I like my stakes to look like.

It's like my cheeks.

I would say my cheeks and nose are very hot pink.

So, I think it's like, I mean, I think it's like a lot of things.

I think it's really cool.

I think it's like a lot of things.

It's like a lot of things.

I think it's like a lot of things.

But I think it's like a lot of things.

I think it's like a lot of things.

And I think it's like a lot of things.

I think it's like a lot of things.

It's like a lot of things.

I think it's like a lot of things.

It's like a lot of things.

I think it's like a lot of things.

It's like a lot of things.

I think it's like a lot of things.

I think it's like cucumbers and buns.

I'll have a truck downtown Los Angeles, cucumbers and buns.

The truck will be called CIB.

CIB.

Okay.

Maybe CIB.

It's called comedy vang vang.

I don't want to cause any confusion in the marketplace here.

Although I...

We already had the truck printed.

Well, I do admit that my trademark does not extend to food trucks.

The titty council is always there.

Hey, you want titty council?

Lift up my show.

City council?

That's why I kept my names for my trucks.

Of course, the old expression that we've all said.

CUBE.

Do you cook the cucumbers or are you charring them at least?

Great question.

We steam them and then we boil them.

Then you boil them?

Uh-huh.

Okay.

And then you can get mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup, anything you like.

So they're soft.

So everything that people like about cucumbers.

About cucumbers to snap.

We don't play that game.

No, it's just kind of mushy.

Uh-huh.

No snap, no nothing.

These are safe for everyone including babies.

Really? Babies can eat these because they're all just mushy.

Babies love these.

Babies is all biggest market.

We have children coming there without the parents.

We had to call the police all the time.

So just children, it's almost like the pied piper you're truck in a way.

They're just like wandering outside because they hear, like does it play music, the truck or?

Yes, it plays only Pearl Jam 10.

Oh wow.

Pearl Jam 10.

That's it.

Front to back.

And then repeat.

It's not on random.

It's not on shuffle.

Pearl Jam 10 repeat.

For them 10 repeat.

In order, thank you.

It's a concept album.

I didn't realize that.

Oh please.

What is the concept?

I guess I've only heard it.

The concept is Jeremy is having a hard time.

Well that's one song certainly.

That's the whole band.

I didn't realize that extended to a live.

He's spoken.

I don't know if he spoke on the other nine.

He did.

You know, even flows about.

That's about a child.

Well OCD who wants to get that peanut butter on every corner.

Get that even flow.

That songs about peanut butter.

That's about Jeremy and his OCD.

Okay.

I didn't realize.

I mean you've heard me know way more times than I have obviously.

Yeah.

So don't don't don't don't don't check yourself.

Don't stress yourself.

Okay.

We'll do neither of those things.

So when children here Pearl Jam's 10 they know that the CIB truck is coming through.

The CIB truck comedy bang bang bang.

It's real close.

We better go get our cucumber heart out.

Wow.

And how have sales been?

Through the roof.

What does that mean exactly to you?

One month 14 million.

Wow.

He has been on the show before.

I guess I don't know whether it's fair to say that he's an entrepreneur as well as much as he's a working guy.

I mean like 85% of the guests that you have on the show are entrepreneurs.

Oh, it seems like everyone comes on and they they have something that they want to talk about some new business.

That's cool.

But you you have just worked at jobs.

Is that right?

Yeah, that's true.

Please welcome Randy Snuts.

Thank you.

I mean cool.

I should listen to the show.

You should.

Yeah, I think.

Yeah, we have over 600 episodes.

Listen to the 10 hour one first.

You'll enjoy that.

I'm going to get acclimated.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You'll have one reaction or another to that one.

Which one do you think I'll have?

I would gather that you'd be all in after listening to it.

Yeah, we'd go.

Dang, this is a trial by fire and I'm not guilty.

Welcome back, Randy.

It's so great to see you.

Do you know, Dean Dib says she knows you.

Hey, hello again.

Yeah, we have carnal knowledge of each other.

Really?

I hooked up with her when I my grandma gave me a thousand dollars after she died.

Well, she didn't she like welded to me and then press her and I run.

There was no confusion on my part.

I didn't think she passed away and then somehow gave you the thousand dollars.

She kept it in her hand and then there was a note that said like, what Randy is the only person who can grab this out of my cold dead hands.

I was like, grandma.

Yeah, she's titsed out.

Wow.

That was like that's the Charlton Heston thing grabbing something out of cold dead hands.

So yeah, huh?

Well, he didn't want anyone to he said the only way people would take his guns.

Oh, yeah, that was cold dead.

That's all about thousand dollars and I did not spend on guns.

I spent on on night with Bienit.

One night, a full on night.

But now Adam, you paid thousands and thousands of dollars just for one kiss.

So have your rates gone up or?

My rates vary.

Okay, ma'am.

What is it very upon?

Why?

Why was I more expensive?

You came to my service.

Which it says this much for a kiss.

I'm a Randy in real life.

So you met Randy off the clock, but you still charged him.

I met Randy at CBS and he decided to pay for a night of fun, including water park.

Yeah, okay.

We bonded over how long my receipt was.

I was like, how long was it?

Dude, that's what I said.

That's what you said.

Yeah, that's what I said.

That's what you said.

You said that?

Yeah, I was like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, that's what you said?

That's what I said, dude.

Wait, you said that?

Yeah, I said that.

Who said this?

I said it.

That's what I said.

How long was it?

That's what I said.

You said it?

That's what you said?

Yeah, bean dip was there.

The receipt came out.

Why did you say that?

I said it.

Who said this?

I said that.

That's what you said.

I said that.

That's what you said.

That's what I said.

That's what you said.

This is what you said.

What?

No, that's what I said.

That's what you said.

Yeah, bean dip was there.

You were there.

That's what he said.

Up in that CBS.

This is at CBS.

You said that at CBS.

I see where the confusion is.

Adam and I thought that you were saying CBS.

Yeah, so that's why we were like, why would you say network?

All right.

Yeah, because you guys are.

That's not the peacock network.

It's the Tiffany network, I believe.

No, you're both wrong.

Tiffany, another.

What about my perspective?

Tiffany's.

Yes.

Tiffany.

Yes.

Tiffany.

Yes.

She's a pop star.

You know Prince wrote Manic Monday for the bangles.

I do know that.

Yes.

I've got to go see the story.

Just like Carissa, my current girlfriend is always taking the glory out of my life.

Wait a minute.

You're back with Carissa?

I thought you were broken up with Carissa.

Scott, it's not on again off again.

It's off again on again.

Okay.

So you're with Carissa currently?

Yeah, of course.

It's described for those of you who don't recall your previous appearances, describe your relationship to Carissa.

Um, fraught with calamitous scandal.

She's always adding needless drama to my life.

She, as in the way you would describe it a lot of times, she had a lot of scandalous behavior.

Yeah, she did.

She's duplicitous.

What would she do?

Exactly.

She'd always be like, Randy, like, meet me out at the Burger King.

Like, I'm going to buy you dinner.

I'm like, oh man, walkie me.

So I'd show up with a Burger King and it'd be a location that's been closed for weeks.

Really?

She would do this to you.

Yeah.

She'd take you to the recently closed Burger King's.

Oh, she wouldn't even be there.

She'd be punking me because I was her favorite show.

I'll try to tell Randy does a classic move.

But can we all admit punk was a pretty good show?

It's going to be back from what I understand.

Give me reboot.

Yeah.

So very excited for that.

Is she excited?

Is Carissa excited about this?

Yeah, she's the only thing that she's talking about.

I'm writing it because it's going to give her new ideas for scandalous behavior.

Let's re-ignite this love for punking you.

Yeah, it is.

Yeah.

How does she find these Burger Kings that have just recently closed?

I don't know if I could.

Yeah, I guess I didn't realize Burger Kings are closing at that.

It's such a rapid accelerated pace.

Yeah, it's like Sears.

But 1% figured out that they could just chop it off, sell it off, and make a bunch of cash off these dead Burger Kings.

Makes sense.

So they're just closing all over the place.

She's constantly sending you to these.

Yeah, sorry to talk about the economy and this economy.

Oh, this economy?

Yeah, this economy.

Wow.

That's what I said.

So that's, wait, that's what you said?

That's what I said.

That's what you said.

What did you say?

I just said, yeah, that's what I said.

But what did you say?

A second ago.

Like a couple of seconds ago at this point.

Oh, wait, that's what you said.

Yeah, that's what I said.

But what?

That crack about the economy.

Oh.

Oh, okay.

Got it.

So what's been going on with your, I guess your life, Randy?

I mean, you've had many jobs.

You were fired for stealing at a convenience store that you worked at because you kept saying the word yoynk as you stole things.

You know, I saw it too loud once.

I'm back in the workforce.

It only takes once, by the way.

Yeah, no kidding.

That's what I said.

So you would steal and then as you were stealing something, you'd say yoynk?

Yeah.

And then like I was getting away with it.

I didn't realize because I was saying it quietly.

I thought at first I was like, man, me saying yoynk is like exonerating me.

Like people are like, dang, that's ballsy.

So they weren't like busted me, but it turns out they weren't just being very quietly and they weren't seeing me steal this stuff.

Right.

And the one time you said it loud, they said they turned and looked.

Yeah.

And then you were fired from the position.

Yeah.

I was walking out with some beer for my boys.

Who are your boys again?

Just like a crew of good dudes.

Right.

Yeah.

But by name, how many are in this crew, by the way?

Two guys named Kevin on a guy named Michael.

Okay.

So two Kevin's.

Yeah, that is good crew.

That's a good group for people.

This is quite.

Well, Jeff's out of the crew.

What happened?

He sat scandalous text messages to Carissa.

No.

Yeah.

He leaked his own nudes to her.

Oh, I mean, that's one way to go.

Get ahead of it.

Yeah.

Really?

And how did, was she receptive to these?

Yeah, of course.

She was like, y'all Randy, get over here.

Look at this.

I guess when I met receptive meeting, Kivi, it hidden from you and just, uh-uh.

She like saved it to her photo role.

Okay.

And then she like started editing it and she was like drawn like little circles around like she was like, look at this part of his body.

It's a lot better than yours.

Which parts are we talking about?

I don't know.

Pretty much everything.

She just circled the whole part of his body.

Yeah.

That make you feel bad.

Yeah.

It made me feel terrible.

Aw, you pull baby.

You need to get away from her.

Dang, I wish I had $1,000 right now.

Well, that's what it takes, be it.

We're nowhere near a water park at this point too.

So, almost a lot of obstacles.

How about I turn into a water park?

I don't know what you're talking about right now.

Well, that's what I said.

Okay.

Is that what you said?

Damn.

That's what I said.

What's going on with your life non-carissa?

Do you have a job now?

Yeah, I re-entered the workforce.

You did?

Yeah, I'm working for a window washing crew.

Really?

Okay.

A bunch of dudes that get up really early.

How early do you have to get up to wash windows?

Is that because you need daylight?

Yeah.

But you want to get on top of it right away.

So, like, you got to be ready to roll by the time the sun's rising.

And there are a bunch of co-cads but otherwise cool dudes.

That's cool.

And what location is this?

The location.

Well, I mean, do you travel around the city doing this?

Or are you washing one place's windows primarily?

I don't want to wash those to wash their windows.

That's the name of the game, Scott.

Okay.

Goddamn.

But I guess do you have a regular route?

Or I got Mr. CEO over here who's like, how do jobs work?

Fucking embarrassing me.

Call me on my show to fucking take down the blue collar working, man.

I'm gonna be listening to sticks on the ride home.

How much is the loaf of bread these days?

By the way, Jesus Christ.

I don't know.

$4 if it's shitty.

How much is a good one?

I don't know.

$6.

Yeah.

$8.

Depends on the location.

Well, I got Mr. Moneybags over here probably shopping at erstwhile or whatever that fancy ass place is.

Here one?

Yeah, whatever.

Erstwhile.

I don't fucking know.

Yeah, you don't because you're a regular working class guy.

And that's what we love about you, Randy.

I saw bread at convenience stores.

You'd what?

Yeah.

Butternut or whatever the white stuff is.

Oh, they sell bread.

I thought you said I saw bread at convenience stores.

So you're doing the window washing thing.

Is that precarious?

I mean, are you afraid of heights?

By the way, don't watch the righteous gemstones if you're afraid of heights.

Because those those stakes get high.

Yeah.

See your psychiatrist about three days before.

Yeah.

Lot of lot of conditions on watching this show.

No, I got bad vertigo.

I saw.

Yeah, then I wouldn't recommend it.

Yeah, definitely not.

Yeah.

I mean, it's your vertigo.

Pretty bad.

So you why are you watching windows if you if you you have terrible vertigo?

I mean, this seems like every single day would be a nightmare for you.

Dude, how many of these problems are I to solve for you?

I watched the ground floor windows.

I let the rest of the team do the rest.

Wait.

So I'm like a hotel that's say 30 stories high.

Like the W like the W.

Yeah.

You're only doing one thirtieth of the work.

I mean, I'll watch the inside of the windows of weight of all of them all the way up.

Yeah.

Okay.

That doesn't give you vertigo.

No, so I'm not going to fall out the window.

Really?

Is that normally like the just the housekeeper's job or this is the service that you provide to Hollywood guys trying to take a shit on a blue collar, man, just trying to make money.

Y'all simply exciting to yourself.

Why don't you wait?

Wait, wait.

No, there I'm put biking to take it on the bloke of man.

What'd you say?

Is that what you said?

Number one, four.

Now that's what I call comedy volume one.

So this, this is not only the comedy bang bang best of 2019, but this is the first volume of now that's what I call comedy.

That's correct.

So we're pulling double duty here.

That's correct.

Funny stuff.

Agreed.

Very much agreed.

Tim is so funny.

VMA.

That's what it stands for.

VMA?

Yeah, very much agreed.

So the MTV VMAs.

The MTV VMAs.

Are just everyone agreed on the best music videos?

Yes.

MTV stands for move to vote.

Move to vote.

Very much agreed.

Fantastic.

The moon man.

Now look, Tim, Edie, so funny.

Put them together.

Together you have a dynamic combo.

That's what I call comedy volume.

Look, if people called us the dynamic combo, I wouldn't mind that either.

So it's the incredible duo.

Incredible duo or the dynamic combo.

I'd take either.

Do not call us the dynamic duo.

Please.

We don't want to start getting out there fighting Joe Chill giving him a heart attack.

And Adam, by the way.

The one criminal that was actually scared by Batman.

He always talked about criminals being a superstitious and cowardly lot.

That's the one exception that proved the rule.

Adam, by the way, is a great guy.

He was so funny on the comedy bang bang TV show.

He's been on the podcast a couple of times, but on the TV show, he came on and did one of our favorite episodes, the Sarah Silverman episode where he played a guy who had a friendship with a ladder.

I can't recall.

It was the little ladder episode, which is insane episode.

He was very funny in that.

Great episode.

And you all voted in at number 14 and now you see what happens.

Now you see what happens.

We listen to a clip.

All right.

Let's take a break.

When we come back, look, what do you think is next?

Well, what just happened?

We listened to episode number 14.

I bet it's going to be episode 12.

No, it's the number one episode.

Wow.

So we're going to just be posted online.

Yeah, we're just going to end it here.

I assume we're skipping 13 because of, you know, superstition.

I'm lucky.

Yeah.

And but you're saying no, we're jumping straight to number one.

I'm so scared.

I just want to get this over with more.

The more distance between me and 13, the better.

No, we, of course, we'll be hearing number 13.

We'll be right back with more comedy bang, bang after this.

As it was foretold, we're back.

We are certainly back.

I was midship of water and I know all decided to come back from commercial or the commercial ended.

And the commercial.

It just cuts off in the middle.

Yeah, I got it.

And this shit.

This is a, well, we're getting up there in the countdown.

We're still in double digits, but at a certain point, we're going to get it down to single digits, not on this episode.

If we keep going, if passes prologue, then yes.

If we keep up the pace, we certainly will get to number one at a certain point.

If we keep up the pace, Pecante.

A mild, too spicy.

Too spicy.

Okay, let's get to it.

This is your episode number 13.

Number one, three.

Okay, this is episode number 13 on the countdown.

And this is episode 612, just two before the previous episode.

And this is from July 29.

Summer. And this is an episode called the Juice Is Loose.

Oh boy, I know who's in this one.

You know who's in this one.

So who?

Carl Tarte.

Carl Tarte, of course.

Carl Tarte, who has been a great addition to this show for the past few years.

Very funny guy went on tour with us a little bit and has done the character that he premiered on the clip we are about to hear on tour.

It's much a claim.

And our good friend Jimmy Pardo is on this clip as well.

Jimmy Pardo.

Jimmy.

A rare appearance.

What comedy bang that?

One of the pod fathers.

Not as, I mean, I was going to say not as rare as I was like.

That's not true.

I like having a moment.

He's on, I would say about every year, I would say.

But like once a year, right?

Like once a year.

Yeah, he's not like you who comes back quite often.

Or Jason Manczukas.

He's a lot.

But Jimmy has a very busy schedule.

I would say I do have to say that.

I don't.

When I landed Jimmy Pardo, it's usually after 20 attempts.

Yes.

Well, he's also a dad.

He's a dad.

He goes out of town.

He has a lot of different things.

Yes.

A lot of iron's in the fire.

Also Lauren Ashley Smith was on this episode.

Won't be on this clip because we picked a clip that comes up before her character comes up.

But Lauren was the head writer, I believe, of a black girl sketch show.

Is that what it's called?

Yes.

A black lady sketch.

I'm sorry to call her a girl.

You call her show a girl.

But Dr. Is a woman though.

They have established that.

That is very true.

She's very funny.

We won't be hearing her on this clip though because I think people voted on this episode due to this chunk of the show that we'll be hearing.

And Carl is essentially playing, well, even more than essentially, in fact is playing OJ Simpson.

What if when you voted, you got to say why you were voting?

You give a reason in the comments.

I'm voting for Pete Buttigieg because I think he's the best candidate.

So you're saying voting for anything?

Yeah, anything.

Very much agreed.

If you vote for the very much agreed.

I'm voting for the right now video because I liked when they turned it into a Pepsi commercial.

Yeah.

More things should be Pepsi commercials.

How many things are?

Magruder.

The right now video by Van Halen.

Police brutality.

Police brutality with Kendall Jenner.

That's right.

And Michael Jackson.

The end.

The four Pepsi commercials.

That's the back of the four billies.

Oh, yeah, we don't want to kill the lily.

We're missing on a selling two different shirts.

That's a good point.

Okay, so Carl, I don't mean to speak for him, but he's not here.

But this is what I remember of the process.

As many of you know, OJ Simpson joined Twitter this year.

Is that just this year?

It was just this year.

Just right before this episode, I believe, which was the summer, maybe a month or two before.

And he has a very unique Twitter style, which Carl noticed and started doing an impression of with his friends and around the house and said, hey, I want to do it on the show.

And the one request he made, usually when we do the show, if you don't know, all I ask of the guests is, hey, what is the name of your character and how would I introduce you?

Yes.

Because I don't want to introduce people and spoil their joke.

Like they'll usually tell me, oh, I am a, then tell me what their job is.

And I'll say, do you want me to say that?

Or do you want to be the one that reveals it because I don't necessarily want to spoil it for the listener if they want to be the ones disclosing the information?

Yes.

So usually that's all we talk about.

But in this instance, Carl only had one request, which is, please don't know that I am a murderer.

I hope that's how he phrased it.

Just signing to that.

That's an amazing request.

Please, please don't know that I'm a murderer.

Either don't know or don't ever bring it up.

I can't recall which it was, but, but, so that leads to this very funny clip where OJ Simpson comes on the show and, oh, look, I don't want to set it up anymore than that.

Let's just listen to it.

This is your episode 13.

Number one, please.

Please welcome to the show OJ Simpson.

Hey, I want to say thank you, Scott.

I want to appreciate you for bringing me on to your platform.

My pleasure.

I got to be honest with you.

I had a lot of time with my hands and I started to love the show.

I loved it.

I listened to so many of the episodes and I really got a sense of...

We've done 600 or so.

How many of you heard?

Absolutely.

Oh, hundreds of them.

Absolutely.

I have, you know, some of the, some of my favorite people have been here.

I love the way you talk to them, your interactions with them.

I love everything you do with this, Scott.

Thank you so much.

So congratulations to you.

Thank you so much.

I'm a mutually big fan of yours.

I admit that around the early 90s, I sort of dropped out and didn't really keep up with your career.

But certainly up to naked gun two and a half.

Absolutely.

I don't, maybe even the third one, I was still paying attention.

Third and third.

That's right.

That's right, Scott.

And I'm not quite sure what happened to you, but it's great to see you resurface.

Well, you know, I went through some things.

Everybody has trials and tribulations in their lives.

Oh, I bet they do.

I'm back now.

I'm happy to be here.

Thank you for giving me a platform.

You're a major Twitter presence now from my age.

I got on the Twitter, you know, my daughter was telling me that I had to get on Twitter.

You have a daughter.

Yes, I do.

I have a daughter, Anderson.

Are you married?

I can't recall.

No, I'm not currently married.

Scott.

Not currently.

Okay.

You were at one time?

I was at one time.

I had two wives in my life.

Oh, great.

Scott, I don't want to take up too much of your time here.

No, thank you, but you're on for a good, nice segment here.

So I'd love to have you on as long as you'd like to be.

I'd love to be here.

I'm just really thankful for it, Scott.

I tell you, those times that I used to watch your games just making those runs into the end zone.

You know, Scott, I averaged no clue where my football.

None.

There's an end zone in football.

There's an end zone.

Scott, you got that right.

So one thing you got to know about me, I was running back for the Buffalo Bills and then for the later in my career for the San Francisco 49ers, which I got to play for my home team.

Oh, that was a real joy for me.

You know, I met my second wife when I was playing for the San Francisco 49ers.

Really?

What does she do?

Well, Scott, you know, I don't want to get too far deep into that.

Oh, okay.

Well, you're not together anymore.

No, we're not together anymore.

Yeah, I'm sorry if I brought up something painful.

But I tell you, I averaged 11,000 yards.

Now let me tell you something about ego, Scott.

Okay.

So the other day I was going around talking about...

That's like two thirds of the way of Tuna, Egot.

Yeah, yeah.

Three quarters of the way.

I never made it there.

I never made it.

Which ones do you have?

I thought I deserved...

I don't have any of them.

Yeah.

I thought I deserved...

If you were an Egot, with a Heisman, you would have one of those.

If there was an Egot, I would have a Heisman.

I thought I deserved an Oscar for playing Nordberg.

Nordberg.

Yeah, Nicki Gunfield.

But you know, it didn't work out that way.

So incredibly lovable and clumsy.

I love the part of...

I believe it's Nicki Gun where he's wearing that ski mask.

And he's sitting there about to break onto the boat where all the criminals are.

And he's disguising himself with a ski mask.

Yeah.

That was one of my favorite scenes.

You like that scene?

You feel close to home.

Now, Scott...

You filmed that close to home?

I know, you said.

Yeah, we did actually.

We filmed that scene in Marina Del Rey.

Oh, wonderful.

Close to my house, you know, over in Brentwood.

In Brentwood?

Was that where you were?

It was where I was living at the time.

I no longer have that house.

It was a beautiful estate.

It's gorgeous area.

Yeah, great.

You know, live down the street from Michael Jackson.

I tell you that much.

Oh, great.

That's too.

I felt like...

I stopped paying attention to him too.

Listen, I don't get too far into people's personal things, but I will say this.

The man was always nice to me.

And there was one time where I had my niece was over to my house.

And she loves Michael Jackson.

It was the 80s.

All the kids did.

Oh, of course.

You know?

And so she came over and I called down and said, hey, Mike, why don't you come down and say hello to my niece?

And he came right down and he saw my niece and he said, let me know when you have your nephew come over.

He said that.

Yeah.

But that was the kind of joke that we had.

You know, that was the kind of jokes that we had back in the days.

I don't understand the joke.

It was 19.

He signed an autograph for it, you know.

Oh, okay.

You know, he loves the children.

I understand it, but he's a children guy, you know?

I don't know, but he was always nice to me.

You know, people go through trials and tribulations.

Scott, that's the thing is like a lot of people and I don't pay attention to pop culture that much, but a lot of people don't realize what celebrities are going through when they're in the news.

They don't realize it's got the media painting in a certain way.

I'm sure you've had some things said about you that you don't love Scott.

There's trolls everywhere.

There's trolls everywhere, Scott.

That's right.

Okay, you take care now, Jimmy.

That's it for me.

Jimmy, I wanted to ask you something.

Should I leave?

Yeah, you could go.

All right.

You've been doing your podcast.

I have, you're 2006, huh?

Yeah.

That's been a long time.

Do you ever get worried that some things you said in the earlier days of your podcast?

Yes, I do.

Yeah.

And but you just got to kind of leave them out there.

Well, they're out there already out there.

What am I going to do?

Go back and edit all those now?

Exactly.

I agree with you 100%.

Yeah.

Certain things on your past are just out there.

They all have things that we're not proud of.

I'm sure.

Oh, Scott's back.

Hey, Scott.

Sorry, sorry.

I don't mean to interrupt a private conversation between the two of you.

No, no.

I just relate to Jimmy a lot.

I think it's a journey.

I think Jimmy and me in a way.

I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

I've always kind of felt like Jimmy, you're the OJ of podcasting.

Are you a trophy winner?

Sure.

Thank you.

So what have you been up to lately?

Well, you know, I was I was recently released from prison.

I think people know that yes, I went to prison for what?

For something really silly, you know, these guys, these guys, they stole my memorabilia stuff that felt really near and didn't mean something for me.

Yeah.

So why didn't you go to prison then?

I went to prison because I went to go get it back.

It was a lapse in judgment.

I made a mistake.

One of the biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life.

So you just got your stuff back?

I went and I got my stuff back, but it was some sort of set up and the police were there.

I had I was drinking at the time.

It was Las Vegas.

You know what they say?

When happens in Vegas, it stays in Vegas.

I tell you one thing, they extradited me.

Yeah.

And you know, that was probably the biggest mistake I ever made in my life.

How long are you in for?

I was in prison since 2007.

Oh my God.

That's a long time.

There was an inconsequential.

It's almost as if like a lot of times you hear about a situation like that and they're like, Oh, well, it's justice for something else that happened.

Yeah.

But you know, that's not how the system works.

So they sent me up.

They sent me up the river for trying to take back my own things.

But I'm out now.

I got a new lease on life.

I'm on Twitter.

Do you have a new lease on a new place?

Because you're not there in Brentwood anymore?

Yeah.

I got I got a new condo.

I got a new condo.

I heard you guys talking about the comedy condo.

And I tell you one thing, the condo that I'm living in right now has a lot of jokes all the time with me and my friends playing fantasy football.

That's right.

You take care of that.

You said you just missed God.

Are you golfing?

Are you hitting the links?

You know, I'm on that golf course almost every day.

You are.

I'm enjoying retirement.

You know, that's basically what you do every day.

Retirement from prison.

Yeah.

It's been a long career.

You know, I will say the prison thing, you know, going to prison was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made in my life that and I couldn't left against the Cleveland Browns in 1977.

I tell you that much.

When you say when you said not cutting, I knew what you were talking about because I knew you would immediately follow it with left because that famous Cleveland Browns game.

Yeah, I cut right and I got tackled right there in there.

Yeah.

And you know, we lost, but I tell you one thing about those Buffalo Bills is a resilient fan base.

You know, it's been a history of losing over there in Buffalo, but they're resilient fan base.

They got amazing love for you.

And it's a great place to be.

Must be nice to me.

You take care of it.

Okay.

Jimmy, take it.

Take it over for me.

How's the golf game?

I want to go back to that.

Are you shooting well juice or you know, struggling because you were in prison for so long.

I'm struggling.

I'm muscles tight.

The muscles are tight.

And you know, we age it every day, Jimmy.

Oh, yeah.

And we're getting older and getting colder.

That's what they say, you know, go.

I'll take it.

And it's hard for me to get my swing exactly back, but I'm on the court every day.

The weather is warm in Los Angeles right now.

I'm having a great time.

And the grass is greener on the other side.

I tell you that much and I'm walking along that green.

All right, Jimmy, you take care.

Oh, wow.

Am I back?

You're back, Scott.

Okay, great.

So who are your friends these days?

Because I remember back in the old days, I remember you had a lot of really good friends.

Like, I mean, it's been amazing to see what Kim Kardashian has been up to because you were such good friends with her father.

Absolutely.

Robert was one of my great friends.

And you know, I want to dispel a rumor right now because this has been something, you know, I told everybody when I got on Twitter that I was going to be getting back and getting even.

Oh, you did?

Okay.

I wondered what that meant because, you know, like I said, I had not kept up with you and I was like, who does he need to get even?

I wanted to spell Robert Kardashian was one of my very best friends.

I met him at USC in the 1960s.

He was a great guy and he married a beautiful woman named Chris and she was great and they had a host of beautiful children, Robert Jr. and Kim and Chloe and Courtney and they're all great girls and I love what they're doing now.

But I want to dispel this thing.

Me and Chris have never had any type of relationship.

Anytime.

And so I'm not even friendly.

We were very friendly at one time and, you know, some things change when people grow apart and Robert passed away.

They grew apart and they had a great relationship when they were together.

But there's this rumor floating around that I'm the father of Chloe Kardashian.

Really?

And I just want to say that it's not true.

Let's dispel that rumor right here on comedy.

Bang, bang.

Okay.

Yes.

Oh, when you say bang bang, it's a sense of chill up and down my spine for some reason.

Oh, why?

I don't know what it is.

Because I say it was so much bigger.

You know, I haven't done it.

I haven't done much radio in my life.

I tell you that much.

I was more of a TV and film guy, but I'm happy to be here.

This is great.

All right, Scott.

Take care.

Now you have a good one.

I don't know who's supposed to talk to you.

Now, Jimmy, yeah, yes.

Have you ever had any of the Kardashians on your show?

I've not had any of the Kardashians.

They seem to spend the time over on E.

Ah, yes.

Yeah.

And you don't work with them too much, huh?

I don't know.

E or the Kardashians?

The E's.

No, well, I just work with E's early on, but I'm not so much recently just.

Now when you warm up in audience for a live talk show.

Yeah.

Well, what happens if the audience does, do you do your normal material?

Or do you do a lot of crowd work?

Well, you try to do the crowd work and try to bring them in any way you can.

You try to get them in that.

You want that audience.

Am I right?

You want the audience warm because a body that's enjoying itself and that is alive is very warm.

If a body were cold, that's the last thing you want is like a couple of cold bodies.

Oh, you don't want that.

You said it, Scott.

You said you hit the nail on the hand.

I tell you that much.

You hit it right on the butt.

Is that where you usually want to hit things is just right on the head?

You want to hit things wherever you can hit them.

The just a few times.

But I tell you this.

Those are gorgeous.

You're wearing a couple of gloves right now.

Those are gorgeous.

Isotones.

I still, you know, after I went to prison for stealing my stuff back, I lost a lot of my endorsement deals.

Oh, yeah.

And but isotoner, they stayed with you.

They stayed with me.

They did.

Well, that's a sign of a great company.

They got a good product.

They got a shot at oil.

Isotones.

And those shoes too.

These are Bruno Mali's.

I thought I recognized that.

Yeah, that's right.

You know, once you get comfortable in a certain brand, you got to stick with it.

I will say that you're kind of like fiddling with your gloves a lot as if they don't quite, I don't know what the expression would be.

Well, you know, I think if the way that they wrap around your hand.

They don't fit very well.

Oh, yeah.

That is true.

I think I got a wrong size, Scott.

And you know, I've been playing a lot of golf.

And you know, like we said early, we're aging now.

I'm getting a little bit older.

I'm in my 70s.

Yeah.

My blood.

Hands tend to swell up.

Yes.

One little bit.

Yeah.

So, so those gloves, they don't, how did you put it?

They don't fit.

Okay.

The gloves.

Well, then we, you know what you have to do.

Get new gloves.

Yeah.

And I got a call over to the Isotone guys.

They don't have a website.

I got a call over there.

I don't have a website.

No, it seems like just call up squares 2019.

Yeah.

All right.

Look at beautiful templates.

And you can customize anything with just a few clicks of the mouse.

Really?

Yeah.

On Squarespace.

You should get a website.

I should get a website.

Scott, what do you say we go in on a website to get it?

I would love to do a Scott Ockermann OJ Simpson dot com.

Oh, I would love to have that.

So I'm going to call up squarespace against Scott Ockermann and OJ Simpson dot com.

And we'll, we'll just start putting out content.

Boy, that's, that sounds like a balding me, Scott.

You take care.

Oh, I guess I'll call you when it's done.

Jimmy.

Yeah.

Yes, yours.

Doing a podcast for this long.

And I remember when those podcasts first started, it was just a little box that popped up on my iTunes where I had a lot of my music that I like for my day, you know, the OJ's sentation bands that are your own name.

I like the old, I'm a big OJ's fan.

Did you like orange juice Jones as well?

I liked the way I saw you and him walking in the rain.

Let me tell you, that would have made me mad too.

If I saw my lady walking in the rain with some other gentleman, but you know, that's another conversation for another day.

Let's promise me we'll have that conversation because I would love to hear your thoughts on that.

Absolutely.

We will Scott.

I just want to thank you for letting me be here, Scott.

It's always great to have you.

In fact, you know what?

I'm, you've been out of the news for a while, but I'm going to do a little research on what you've been up to recently because I'm, I really, during the break, we have to go to a break here, but I'm going to do a little, a little research on you and see what you've been up to.

But when we come back, we have a vocal coach.

This is really exciting.

You have such a great voice.

So J.

And he's back.

I'm back, baby.

He's back, baby.

Juice is loose.

All right, Scott and Jimmy, y'all take care.

Number one, three.

Ah, yes.

And he did it, he did it on tour this year, and it was so much fun to figure out how to dance around that fact.

That fact.

Extremely gigantic fact of O.D. Simpson's life.

Probably the most important thing to happen to him.

Yeah.

And he's had a, he's had quite a lot of interesting things happen to him.

The guys had an interesting life, including being a murderer.

In the eyes of the civil courts.

And so I don't know whether we have to say allegedly still.

And by the way, this is a satirical program, so we don't have to say it at all.

Yeah.

Let's do song parties.

We don't have to pay for it.

Very fun.

Carl is so funny and will perhaps be making another appearance on the countdown, if not more than one.

We don't know.

Wouldn't be a bit surprised.

We don't know.

Well, look, we have to take a break.

When we come back, we're going to keep counting it down.

Yeah, we have no choice.

We have no choice.

We'll go back the other way and recount down, you know, number 14, number 15.

We've already heard those.

You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube.

You might be a redneck if you do.

What are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just, what are you just not making any sense anymore?

Like if you get the genie out of the bottle, you might just be a redneck.

If you put toothpaste back in the tube after you use it, you may just be a redneck.

If a penny saved isn't a penny earned, you might just be a redneck.

Oh, and maybe it does make sense.

Are rednecks bad with money?

If you pretend, do they not bleed?

The immortal bard once again.

All right, let's take a break.

When we come back, we'll keep counting it down to number 12.

Comedy Vang Bang, we are back here with Paul of Tonkins.

I'm him.

And we are counting down your top 15 plus one live episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

And we are coming up here on our final segment.

This is our final clip of this particular episode, which is part one of four.

How did we get here?

I took Bronson.

No.

We, how did not, how did we get here individually?

How did we, Scott, how did we get here to this part of the countdown?

We did 15.

No, I'm doing poetic talk.

Oh, how did we get here?

Oh, Verily.

Thus, I say to be.

Spake.

Zarathustra.

Do you have any bets on what number 12 is going to be?

Yeah, funny.

This is, let's just let us Terry know further.

Let's get to it.

This is your episode number 12.

Number one, two.

All right.

Number 12.

All right.

This is episode.

Now listen to this.

Oh, this is episode six hundred and fifteen.

Six one five.

What a clump right after six fourteen and then six twelve was the previous one.

This is from August nineteen.

No, no, no, nineteen.

Yeah, the, which is summer.

All four of these are from the summer.

What a curious clump.

And that's exactly what Eddie Murphy said, I believe, after the first nutty professor.

Right.

And then he decided to base the entire sequel upon all of them.

And then that was it.

And then he was like, I'm done.

This was miserable.

I'll only do it one more time for Norbert.

And then that's it.

And that is it.

And of course coming to America.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

He puts on makeup for that.

Yeah.

How was his SNL?

Did you enjoy it?

This one that was just two days ago?

Did not see it.

Didn't realize that it happened.

No, well, of course, that press time it has not happened yet.

Scott, you tricked me.

I did trick you.

That's time.

I'm one of these impractical jokers.

Wait a minute.

This is, are we in press time right now?

We are in press time.

Oh, man.

He, Penini press time.

Oh, I wish.

Oh, man.

Please, Penini, don't hurt him.

Oh, Penini.

But, doctor, I am Penini.

Let's talk about Lil Nas X.

He made his debut this year.

I'm in this show.

What if he, he's a character, by the way, a lot of people don't know, but he's a character.

In reality, he's big.

Yeah.

Zeke Nicholson plays him.

And he tricked all of America into liking his old town road song.

And he's a comedian and he started on this show.

A lot of people don't know that.

Check it out, everyone.

This is, okay, so this is episode 615 from August 19th.

And this is an episode entitled The Chestman Family.

Paul, do you know this episode?

Yes, I do know this episode very well.

Very well, because you were a participant.

Yes, it's true.

Now it can be told.

This is an episode which has two of the stars of the BBC television show Orphan Black, Tatiana Maslani and Christian Bruin.

Tatiana is an Emmy award winner for her role of several of the orphans.

Yes, he is.

Christian is not.

One zero Emmys.

He is not for playing the husband.

He did not win one for playing Constable Johnstable.

No, he certainly did not on whatever that show was.

Heiden Seek, the movie.

He did not win an Emmy for that.

What about the...

Brian.

The movie that he was...

He did not win an Emmy for what about Brian?

The movie he was promoting on this episode ready or not.

Has he won an Emmy for that?

No, that's what I'm talking about.

Heiden Seek.

He did not win an Emmy for Heiden Seek.

I thought Heiden Seek was a different thing.

No.

It sounds...

See, this is the thing about Christian.

It sounds plausible.

He's been in so many things that you know you just have never heard of.

He didn't win an Emmy for the Handmaid's Tale for playing Creep.

That's right.

For playing TLC's Creep.

He came onto the Handmaid's Tale.

One of the Handmaid's Tale's...

Just like in Say Anything, press the boom box.

Press the jukebox.

Underneath the Handmaid's Tale's window.

Give it a fancy punch.

And suddenly it started playing TLC's Creep.

Please let someone Photoshop this at least a picture.

At least a picture.

At least a picture of not a video of him doing this.

Yeah, please make a video.

Go out and film.

Go out and film him doing this.

Yeah, do a deep dance.

Go out and film him doing this.

And then we could say it's from the Handmaid's Tale.

There's got to be a scene in the Handmaid's Tale.

I have not seen it, but there's got to be one where...

It's just the one hand.

The Handmaid's Tale where Elizabeth Moss looks out a window, right?

There's got to be...

It's somewhere in there.

I don't think so.

Really?

They don't have windows.

I don't think so.

They have windows.

I'm remembering the series now.

I don't think her character ever looks out a window.

But if there was one, and then get the John Q-Sec from say anything, put Christian's head on top of John Q-Sec and then put TLC's creep on the boombox.

Okay, you have to be...

The Stag!

You have to be an editing master.

You have to be a Frank Pulaski himself to do something like this, by the way.

By the way, Frank hope you're doing well out there.

Frank hope you're doing well.

Out there in Hawaii, I believe you are.

Yes, Mahalo.

He's made a lot of videos.

That's where there's the Q-Stacks.

John Q-Stacks?

You got to be careful.

So, Frank or anyone, please do that for us.

Oh, now that's a real challenge to Frank.

Because of course he wants to be the guy to do it.

He's recuperating.

He tripped over a Q-stack.

He tripped over John Q-stack.

Oh, and an Q-stack.

You know what?

I was on a plane with them one time.

Really?

One time?

It was when I did the Informat.

You were in the Informat and you did a play?

No, I was on a plane.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

I thought you said I did a play.

I mean, they were an acting family.

I would love to have done a play with the Q-stack sisters.

Yeah, I would love that.

But I was...

So we filmed in...

Like, it was...

Were we in Iowa or something?

We went to film.

It was very strange.

We went to a local hire.

They flew you out.

No, they flew me out.

I shot in Los Angeles and this courtroom scene.

We shot in...

I can't remember what state it was like.

A place I'd never been before.

And we shot inside of an actual courtroom.

It was strange that we went all the way there.

Yeah, there's a play.

But we gave courtroom sets here in Los Angeles.

Yeah, but there was...

So we were...

There was a ton of people there.

Patton Oswalt was there.

I remember we had lunch together in the...

This is Steven Soderbergh's film, The Informancy.

Steve, Steve...

Oh, sorry.

Steven Soderbergh, of course.

And...

And Joan Q-Sack, I can't remember if they were both in the movie.

Whether they were just hanging out.

But it seemed like it was a coincidence that they were on the plane together.

And I was sitting next to one of them.

They didn't sit next to each other.

Well, they asked if I would switch.

Oh.

So they could sit together and I said, of course.

Of course you were on the Q-Sack.

Yes, and then at one point I tried to do a bit with them where I leaned around from the seat I was in front of them.

Okay.

And I care where what the bit was, but they did not find it funny.

They were very confused.

Do they not know you were in the film?

And then when you showed up on the set they were like, oh, it's the bit guy from the airplane.

I think...

No, this is on the way back.

Oh, so they never saw either one of them again.

Except on the silver screen.

Of course.

But I can't remember what the bit was, but I remember them registering that it was a bit weight like I helped until they realized it was a bit.

And then when they sort of polite laughed, I slunk back to the seat.

I hate that feeling.

It wasn't a major sign.

It was an order sign.

I know, never forget it.

What was the situation?

I was talking to a friend and I launched into some bit based on what she said and I think she got defensive about what she had said.

Like I was trying to say she was wrong about something and I was like, oh no, we were just like, we were having fun.

That happened to me too recently, but it was the person's fault, not my fault that they took it too seriously.

Okay.

I, it was probably, this one was probably my fault where I was not.

Was this somebody, was this like a good friend?

See him five times a year.

Yeah, great friend.

Okay.

As friends go, that's good for me.

Yeah.

So, and then at a certain point, I was like, do I explain that I'm just doing a bit?

And I was just like, I'm just going to give up.

Well, then that's not a good friend.

I just extricated myself in the situation.

That's not a good, if it's a good enough friend, of course, you say, look, I was kidding around.

And then it just dug itself deeper into a, and his person sounds like a chore.

Yeah.

Wait, was it me?

Yeah.

The shaggy sequel.

Wait, was it me?

Wait, maybe I'm misremembering this.

Am I in my recollection?

Now I'm hearing your side of things?

It might have been me.

That might have been me.

Um, all right.

Let's get back to this.

This is a Tatiana and Christian were here.

Christian had his movie ready or not that he was promoting.

And we talk about that previous to the clip we'll hear where some things that we need to establish, they're not featured in the clip, but you may need to know them before listening to these clips.

Earlier in the show, we talk about going to hell on each other, which I believe is established as some sort of oral sex thing.

Yes.

And I believe that we also talk about, uh, knee pads that were promotional materials for the movie ready or not, ready or not, knee pads that one would use while one was doing that going to hell on someone.

Right.

And also one thing you need to know is I, uh, around this time, uh, and hopefully in the future, I had been doing, uh, a lot of ads for Thomas's English muffins, which by the way, every single time, I'm just going to, since the best ofs are where we talk about the process, uh, every time I do one of these in the ad, I am eating an English muffin supposedly, uh, in it.

And people say, Hey, will you stop eating while you're doing the ad?

And, and what they don't know is that that is part of the ad.

I am told to eat an English muffin by the Thomas's, by the Thomas's themselves, Kristen Scott Thomas, Henry Thomas.

Yes.

Philip Michael Thomas.

Sure.

And of course, Justice Claire, the council of Thomas's gets together the Thomas's and they tell me to eat this English muffin while I do the ad.

Council of Thomas's is a shirt.

That is a shirt.

And there's the four.

Henry Thomas, Chris Scott Thomas, Chris Scott Thomas.

And this is a shirt.

These are all shirts.

But now hold on a second.

We have fun.

Yes.

We do have fun.

Does it really?

We do have fun.

We have fun.

It is acknowledged pointed at me right now.

We do have fun.

It's not.

They don't actually ask you to eat an English muffin.

Yeah, they do.

They say you read this ad while you are eating an English muffin.

Is that for real?

That is for that is for real.

Yes, for little row.

It's for little rail.

He's not just for little rail.

I hope he's listening.

By the way, he was supposed to be on the show this year.

Oh, no, he didn't he couldn't do it.

I at the last second, this a lot of people wonder about the funny.

He's so funny.

A lot of people wonder about the booking process.

Here's what happens.

Publicists reach out and say, can this person be on the show?

And then there is a.

You always say yes.

Always say yes.

And there is a two month long process of trying to find a date.

And then when we find a date, approximately three days before they drop out.

I remember when I was doing Spontaneous Nation and that show Blunt Talk was about to premiere.

Yes, with Patrick Stewart.

I was married.

I was asked by someone that I don't think works here anymore.

Would you be interested in having Patrick Stewart on the show?

This was Kevin, by the way, this is how we're fighting.

It was not Kevin.

It was.

Surprise, bitch.

Surprise, my good bitch.

Would you be interested in having Patrick Stewart on the show?

Of course I would.

Yes.

The next thing I heard was, all right, we got those ads for you to read for Blunt Talk.

It's like, what happened to.

That's not the same thing.

Same thing at all.

Is it, dude, are you saying, were you saying, would you like to read Patrick Stewart's name on the show?

And that's how he be on the show?

This is what happens.

Publicists, what they do, they get a client.

What they do.

This is what I've figured out over several years of doing the show and hiring a publicist myself.

What they do is they.

And being a publicist for two years.

Yes, of course, yes.

They take on a client and then they put out pretty much a mass email to anyone that they think would possibly be interested in having this person on.

They have not cleared it with the person at this point.

They just say, hey, here's here.

Here are all the email addresses I have.

Would you be interested in having, let's use Patrick Stewart as an example, would you be interested in having Patrick Stewart on the show?

They have not spoken to Patrick Stewart.

They get a bunch of yeses.

They see how many yeses they can collect and then they take all of the asks to the client, Patrick Stewart, and then rank them in what they, like how good they are.

Once they've gotten all the yeses, they're like, oh, wow, we have all these major ones.

You no longer need to do these minor ones.

And they in fact suggest they say, we don't feel you need to do this one underneath it, which always, and we always get tricked into it.

That's always happens to me.

Major stars say they want to do the show supposedly and we bend over backwards and then the stars read the email and go, I'm not going to do that.

And then it just disappears.

But I'm not saying that's little rel because I little rel is a comedian and truly did want to do the show and sometimes though here's another thing that happens sometimes that stars do want to do the show and their publicist doesn't even present that happen with Neil Patrick Harris.

Do you recall that?

Yeah.

A couple years back he was in the best of Neil Patrick Harris listens to the show.

If not every week occasionally and want if not every week he listens occasionally and wanted to do the show asked to do it.

We tried to set it up and then the publicist never passed it on to him and he took a look at his schedule and said, wait, where's comedy bang bang and made sure that it was on his schedule.

And this is getting back to Tatiana and Christian got to.

They of course are big stars and on major television shows and Tatiana's in movies and Christian has appeared in movies.

What would you say is the chief difference?

I mean Tatiana is like sought out for movies and Christian auditions.

No, Christian, you're a great friend.

We're just razzing you.

They were both comedy bang bang fans first before we met them.

That's right.

And we met them because they were fans and they would listen to it during Orphan Black and talk about their favorite episodes.

And I remember Tatiana saying that she would when she would bike around Toronto, she would be listening to episodes and she came up to Andy Samberg and Lauren Lapkis at a party that they all happened to be at and started wrapping the Hollywood facts theme, which is from several years ago, it was an episode you can hear it in a previous best of.

So she and Christian are both fans and they're now friends, but they were fans first, came to see us in San Diego wearing Ninja Mutant turtle costumes.

And so they're fans and it's always a pleasure to have them on the show and their dear lovely people.

And I enjoyed about this episode.

It's the two of them, Paul F. Tomkins and then Kirby Halbaptiste, who is a she is people primarily know her as an actress now who's on every good show from Killing Eve to Barry to the good place.

She's on every good show and she is a comedian who started out at the Upride Citizens Brigade.

I got to know her.

She was on the comedy banging TV show.

And so she's been on the show a few times, I believe, doing characters.

And so what happened on this episode is it was the four of you.

I believe I booked Tatiana and Christian and then asked you to do it.

And then Kirby also was only available that day.

So we put the four of you together.

And what happened was first of all, the four of you, was it early in the morning or I can't remember, but it had had what you described as crazy sleepover.

Yeah, I feel like it was early in the morning.

Yeah, I think it was like first thing in the morning and everyone came in kind of loopy.

And I had I had texted Tatiana and Christian before when when I knew we were all going to be on together before I knew Kirby was going to be on and said, do you want to do something like a bit together?

Right.

You know, because occasionally, I think the first time that Tatiana and Christian did the show, they were just themselves and then jumped in as characters.

So they are and they're improvisers.

Yes.

They started out as improvisers in Canada.

A lot of people don't know that.

So they are perfectly comfortable jumping in and improvising.

That's correct.

So and then Kirby ended up on the show because of scheduling just happened to be on the show and she decided to.

Well, we asked and we said, would you do you want to jump in on our thing?

We'll be we're going to be a we're going to just going to be a family family.

That's all you guys knew.

We knew.

Yeah.

You were going to be a family.

So Kirby also jumped into it and it turned it out in to be a wonderfully silly and so much fun to do crazy episode.

We're going to be hearing a little bit of this.

This is and the title of the episode is the Chastman family, but it doesn't it doesn't exactly stay there.

I don't even want to spoil any of it.

Let's just hear.

Let's hear a little bit of it.

This is your episode number 12.

Number one, two.

Please introduce yourselves.

You're a family.

From what I understand.

Yes.

My name.

Excuse me.

You're excused.

My name is Robert Chastman.

Robert Chastman.

Yes.

The patriarch of the family.

Oh.

And these are my family members.

My name is Chastity Aspen.

Chastity Aspen.

And I am a family member of this man to my.

We are family members.

What is your relation?

I am his daughter.

Oh, okay.

And you married someone named Aspen?

I married into the family.

Oh, you did.

Oh, I see.

And survived the night.

So you're not a blood relative?

No.

But you survived the night.

But I did survive the night.

Okay.

We have shared blood because...

Yours are someone else's.

Please let me.

You are so out of breath.

You can't do it.

Are you ever going to get your breath back?

I walked up.

Or is this your natural state?

I walked up the stairs.

I know.

It's one flight.

Oh, tell me about it.

We carried him up halfway.

So it's half a flight.

Yeah.

And you're out.

I'm terribly sorry.

I'm not as good of shape as I used to.

That's right.

Do you think you'll regain your composure?

Or will you?

I think we'll tell.

Okay, great.

So, uh, chastity and marriage into the family.

And I gave her a little bit of my blood in the vial to put into her own veins so that we could be, uh, be gone.

Blood relatives.

Oh my goodness.

Are you, are you yawning?

Or are you, you're just still out of breath?

No, I got dizzy.

I thought I was going to go lights out.

That was one of his lights out moments.

He has a little lady out every now and again.

Who are my loms?

Yeah, your loms.

Light up, light up.

Light up, yeah.

When that happens soon, we have to transfer the blood back.

How long have you been part of?

Oh, really?

Yeah.

So you have to, where do you keep, where do you keep that blood?

Oh, we have vials.

And how long have you been with a family?

I've been with a family three weeks.

Three, wonderful weeks.

Three weeks.

Okay.

And who did you marry?

Who did you marry?

I married this man across the way.

Hi.

Oh, and what's your name, sir?

My name is Bransden Chastoming.

Bransden.

Chastoming.

Chastity.

And I've been married for three weeks.

And I thought it a little bit strange that my father gave her blood when I would have easily offered my blood to her because she's my wife.

Oh, well, you got to get in there early, I guess.

This is the first time hearing of this.

I wish you'd.

Well, I would have offered it, Father, but you readily popped a vein and added a vial of blood to her without consulting me.

And, you know, I think you should have it.

It was a wedding gift.

I can't believe how ungrateful you are.

Well, I am.

I know, but I can't believe it.

Well, you should believe it because traits that I fell in love with him about is ungratitude.

Boys.

Who's this?

Hi.

Cecilia Chastoming.

Hi, Cecilia Chastoming.

So you have a different name.

Yeah.

Did you also marry into the family?

Yes.

Cecilia Chastoming.

Chastoming.

Okay.

And you kept your maiden name, Chastoming.

Like a rastoming, but Chastoming.

I mean, it would have been a bit confusing if she hyphenated.

And Chastoming Chastoming.

Chastoming Chastoming.

It would have been a bit.

Or she could have just changed it to Chastoming.

I am a modern woman.

I wouldn't change it.

Cecilia and I are not.

We are not married.

Oh, we are she.

I am the father.

Yes.

And Cecilia has adopted him.

Hello.

Okay.

Her husband's number one son.

Oh, okay.

So this is this a recent relationship between the two of you?

No, we've known each other since high school.

Oh, okay.

But how long have you known each other if you know what I mean?

I don't know what you mean.

Gone to hell on each other.

What is that mean?

What does that mean?

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm not meant to tell you.

We haven't gone there yet.

You haven't got the talk yet?

No.

It's time for the talk.

Chastity lives up to her name.

And are you just watching the talk?

Sorry for the talk.

The talk is on 10 a.m.

Should we go watch the talk?

Turn on CBS.

They will watch the chew.

It's time for the chew.

I love a good chew.

So, but how long have you been date or romantic, I guess?

Often on.

Often on five, say, seven, and ten years.

Oh, okay.

When you say off and on every other day or what?

Literally every other day.

Every other day.

One day we say on, next day we say we off.

Okay.

You consider her to be your mother.

Well, I call him mother and I call him father.

But she's my stepmother.

Who is your actual mother?

Is she still with us or is she father?

We moved on to go into that.

We moved on that heavenly escalator.

Her blood has been transferred throughout the family.

Yes.

Really?

So she is still with us.

We all carry a lot of her blood.

It's a bit of her blood.

I see.

But when she died, you drained the body of all the blood.

It just happened.

Yeah.

Really?

Yeah.

Just spilling out.

We had to put it somewhere.

Yes, we put a bucket under it.

How did she die then?

Was she like hung on the ceiling and the round was?

Desanguinated.

She was desanguinated.

Yeah.

That's how she died.

She was desanguinated.

No, she was desanguination.

No, she hears the thing.

Here it is.

She liked to sew.

Oh, yes.

Don't get your face.

I know how you're saying.

She was making a flag for the family.

A flag, though.

An American flag or a flag that...

A family flag.

You say family flag is if everybody makes the family flag.

Who doesn't have a family flag?

The flag that everyone's family has.

Yes, the family family.

How do you know who the family is at a house?

And what do you hang outside?

Is it a...

I don't know.

What?

Did you imagine?

Is it a literal representation of pictures of the family or is it like our stars and stripes which represent things?

No, it's like you ever see that on the back of a car?

The car I'm not pissing on the thing?

No, please.

Don't be ridiculous.

They in an out urge sticker?

This is a sacred thing.

Please.

It'll be stick figures of the family in size order.

Holding.

Including pet's holding.

Yes.

With some truck nuts in the corner.

Yes.

Well...

So she was sewing the flag.

Yes.

And she had beautiful long hair.

Beautiful.

Oh, she sounds gorgeous.

She was very proud, prideful of it.

That's a sin.

I don't know it.

And her hair got caught in the sewing machine mechanism.

Yeah.

It pulled her entire body through the sewing machine all the way through.

No.

And she had multiple puncture wounds.

What a horrible way to die.

I mean, as I was complaining.

She's kind of always around because she's sewn into the family flag.

Yes.

It's true.

So her corpse is part of this flag that you guys just fly.

Well, it's dry now and it's quite light.

And flat.

It flaps.

And no blood.

No, it's desanguinated and it flaps.

It flaps.

And honestly, it's nice because I love having my sister around.

It's slapped, it bangs.

It's a ball.

Okay.

I just wanted to check.

So she's out of the picture in that way.

Okay.

And she's in the picture in other ways.

Very nice sound.

And so how long was it before you moved on to Cecilia Chastaman here?

Oh, what a tiny mind you have.

We would have been together the whole time.

Oh, it's time.

Really?

So you were in a throttle situation or?

You think this is it?

Listen, we're on and off every day.

The day I was off, my sister was on.

Yes.

Wait, this was your sister?

Yes.

Oh.

Your genius, Chastaman.

Genius.

So, is she or was she older or younger or twins?

She must have been.

Yeah.

That's true.

It's not so been.

It's quite obvious.

It's quite obvious that she must have been.

She was in the school.

She was quite particular.

Right.

And you guys knew each other from school.

Obviously, you must have sat next to each other because your names are so well.

Yes.

I know you and your sister knew each other from sisterhood.

I'm saying Robert over here.

Yes.

You got to know each other in high school because you sat next to each other.

You were in a homeroom together.

Really?

Yeah.

What are you doing homeroom?

I didn't have a homeroom.

Mostly we pass notes back and forth.

Oh, that sounds adorable.

It was pretty cute.

See, I didn't get to do that because you homeschooled me.

That's right.

You're a better man for it.

Yes.

What was your homeschool experience like?

Well, Eugene Niancicilia would sit me down and...

Well, mother actually said.

Mother and mother.

Mother and mother and mother.

Mother and mother.

But I...

Well, now father, I was explaining to a stranger about the family.

You never talked to outsiders about the family.

I don't know.

Maybe it shouldn't be here, father.

Anyways, they would sit me down and they would teach me everything about birds and bees and trees and letters.

So the four subjects.

Birds.

Bees.

Trees.

Letters.

Birds.

Bees.

Trees.

Letters.

Birds.

Trees.

Letters.

Birds.

Gotta be one of the...

The look at many.

That's what I think of the...

What a wonderful song.

And you would sing that for...

We would sing that for...

Instead of the National Anthem, we would sing that every morning.

Yeah, if you put our hands over our hearts.

Who are these kids singing the National Anthem every morning?

They shipped them in.

They shipped.

That's where I came in.

I was one of the children shipped in for the song, which is why I always enter singing because I'd been trained to do something.

Chastity has a voice of an angel.

I would love to hear an example.

Here's an example.

So angelic.

Look at that bass now.

It'd be a total.

Downset towns of chastity.

Now, chastity would sing the National Anthem as we would...

It was a compare and contrast.

So that...

Sure.

So that...

Brasting.

So the friends...

I flashed on those stairs for a second.

He, L.O.

And that father.

She would sing the National Anthem.

We would say to Brasting.

Let's see.

That's how they do it.

Okay.

I would love to hear the National Anthem because you must know it.

Oh, say can you see...

It's pretty epic.

It goes very well.

It's very...

She sets it up very well.

Oh, look at that.

Yeah, it's...

It's still gleaming.

See, this is when I...

I know these whole words and the...

The interpretation is just delightful.

J. Hamburger.

And hamburger's cooked by the...

And they're so lovely men.

Yes.

And the fluck is red flares.

The layroom down in hairs, hairs.

Brains, prunes, stand-jap, probes.

That your flag was still there.

And take us to Syria.

Said a big banana, stars and...

Wainbleed.

Banana, yes.

Square.

Full land of opportunity.

With a stand on guard for me.

Birds, bees, trees, flesh, birds, trees, trees, letters.

And the birds, bees, birds, bees, letters.

And the birds, bees, letters, bees, letters.

And the birds, bees, trees, flesh, birds, bees, letters.

And the birds, bees, bees, bees, bees, bees, bees.

This is taking me right back to my childhood.

Right.

Well, so I was home-schooled, but we brought people...

Your childhood sweethearts?

Or you've only been married three weeks, did you?

Three weeks.

Three weeks of marriage.

I saw him across the way, so I'm sitting in his little desk, doing his little pencils.

But you have a little desk when you're homeschooled.

You're the only one there.

Well, I built it.

I had to build it out.

Oh, yes.

That was a rickety little thing.

Your handsy that way?

That was hot at the trees!

Oh, quite handsy.

My father has always said I'm quite handsy.

He's quite handsy.

How's it going?

I said, here, put your hands to good use.

It's just that it messed up groping me.

It was cropping you.

Well, it's the opposite of what usually happens.

It was hard to discover what a man is when I'm being taught by...

And I'm being taught by mother and mother.

And that's also why they shipped in the other children.

Oh, the teacher.

The teacher is what a man is.

Yes.

Like how you know if you're on human, you can't teach a dog how to pee.

He has to see another dog pee.

He has to see...

She's peeing.

Oh, German.

Sorry, I'm bilingual.

Oh, you...

Oh, so you speak German.

You speak English in two different accents?

Yes.

Oh, amazing.

She taught us all.

That's what I said.

I said bilingual.

She's...

Chastity, are you okay?

Chastity!

I'm not well.

What's going on with you?

You're not sickly, are you?

I'm super sick.

Yeah, I'm dying.

What's been...

You're dying?

The blood in my body has been being rejected.

I didn't want to bring it up because I know you're not well.

Is it a different blood type?

Oh, it's so kinds of different bloods have been mixed into his body and I got the brunt of it.

My blood type is Jay.

Oh, I've never heard of that one.

Yeah.

Is that just new?

It's not different.

Jay, positive.

No, it's 2019.

Which one?

Did Big Pharma just invented?

I'm Jay positive.

I thought so.

Yeah.

I can tell from your disposition.

Yeah, and it's not great.

That's why he had such a hard time with his stairs.

Oh, I see.

His blood type does not transfer oxygen well.

So all of your blood has been replaced by a new synthetic Jay positive blood?

Well, it's not synthetic.

It's just an amalgam of all the different bloods I've had over a million years.

They just mix them all together and then they inject it into your body.

It's a bit of corn starch in there for a second thing.

There's some carotero.

Oh, no.

It's quite thick.

It's very syrupy and well, I guess it's clogging up poor charities.

I didn't want to bring it up.

So since we're on our honeymoon and all that.

You're still on your honeymoon.

We are currently.

This is the honeymoon.

Oh, really?

Can you tell us, Angela?

This was our gift to them.

This is the biggest thing.

They came along though.

Where are you from?

Where are we from?

Is it obvious?

We all sound exactly the same.

Yes, exactly.

Where else would we be from?

Right.

But the place we came from.

Oh, I see.

And so you say you're dying?

I mean, should you go to a hospital?

Oh, yes.

That's good news.

No, this is the way that it is with Y of Z in the family.

They die within three weeks usually of the injection.

Really?

So wait a minute.

Did you know that going in?

I knew.

You did.

And you wanted to die.

I wanted to die.

You know, I am not meant for this world.

We call her death wish chastity.

Yeah, it's sort of my name.

It's a fun little.

It is fun.

Yeah.

But it's less fun when it becomes reality and serious and my wife's going to die.

So how long do you have on this earth?

I'd say 14 to 20 more minutes.

Oh, really?

Yeah, that sounds about right.

How do you feel chastity?

I'm not well.

This is ending.

Oh, no.

What your life or?

The life I live.

Oh, yeah.

You just say my life.

My life.

She's getting out of the highfalue.

She's getting out of the life.

Oh, I see.

Getting out of this conscious.

Mother, father, what should we do?

I'm losing my brain.

You've gone pale and you have sunk into your knee and your, yeah.

Your cheeks.

My teeth are loose.

I need to lose.

My knee pads making more comfortable for you.

Yes.

If you put them under my eyeballs.

Oh, my God.

Your nostrils just fell out.

Oh, no, my God.

Oh, my God.

We're inside out.

How do the holes fall out?

The holes fall out.

It's weird.

It's so strange.

My brain.

I'm doing, I'm turning inside out as all women do.

Oh, no.

That's the difference.

That's what mother taught us.

Yes.

After 40, it turned inside out.

That's why women becoming visible.

That's why men don't see us anymore.

We turned inside out.

That's scans.

That scans mother.

Like as if we went over a swing very, very fast.

Oh, yeah.

My wife.

Oh, no.

My life.

My life, my life.

Or it says what?

Just, we will miss you.

You were a wonderful addition to the family for this fortnight and a half.

Go on.

You've been the best wife I've ever had.

How many of you have?

Six.

What?

No, nothing.

It's not on the half night.

Did you not?

Did you?

You've had six wives?

Wait, what?

I don't want to die.

No, no, no.

I need to know the truth of this.

Yes, stop turning inside out.

Put those nostrils back in.

Oh, I bumped in.

I'm gonna break up.

Oh, God.

You've had six wives.

I've had a few wives.

This is your sixth wife.

And they've all died?

He's playing in three weeks.

Yeah, he's playing in a trip to St. Ives.

Me, I don't know what that means.

That's where they make the creams and the soaps and the scrubs.

You have to have seven wives to go to St. Ives.

Oh, I have no idea.

Oh, okay.

What do you think this bag of cats is for?

But wait, Chastity, you did not know that you were the sixth wife?

I didn't know this.

I'm sorry.

I thought I was the seventh.

Oh.

Yes.

That's why I was completing the sight of the wives.

No, I need one more wife.

Who is going to take my life?

Well, that depends on father and mother.

They arrange every one of them.

Do you have a candidate in mind?

Well, we ship someone in, but I have a very good daughter who could be a prime candidate.

So good.

Would you like to meet her?

Yes, meet her.

She got out.

She's been outside this entire time.

Oh, yes.

Oh, yeah.

Bring her in.

This is a surprise.

The daughter bell.

Come in, the daughter bell.

This is my dear rebel.

Hello.

What a beautiful voice.

Thank you.

Are you the sweet little app with apple of my eye, Branson Pickle?

What's your name, sweetie?

Branson Chastity.

Oh boy, are you ever a little pickle for, to remember?

My God.

Well, surely is a pickle to remember.

You can talk.

You can really talk.

Who would arm it?

What did you say?

What's your name again?

Yeah.

We do it about you.

You know what bell.

She's your daughter bell.

Oh, we've met before?

Yes.

We're blood cousins, you and I.

Should we be getting married mother father?

Yes.

Medulla bell, is it?

Medulla bell?

Medulla bell.

It's a no-bellet.

And Medulla bell in different, in a different language.

In different languages.

I believe it's Medulla bell.

So now you're, you're a Medulla bell, Chastaman.

Yes.

And you, you've never met, uh, Branson.

We only traded letters.

Apparently.

That was part of letters.

But I think they wrote them on my behalf because they set up all these names.

Oh, I see.

But I held the pen on my left hand so it looked like a little kid.

It was doer some bees that were backwards.

Like on a lemonade side.

But you fell asleep on your hand as well.

Yeah, I did.

The stranger.

Yeah.

Why are you making that mean voice?

No reason.

Oh.

So, uh, well, I mean, what do you think?

Hey guys.

I mean, if you like what you see, Chastady meet Medulla bell.

Medulla bell.

This will hurt.

Yeah.

Well, this, what, this will hurt.

This is hurting.

Honey, it's not quite nice.

What's with her eyeballs?

What's with those little eyeballs?

She's dying very soon.

Oh, nostrils fell out.

Get rid of her.

Get her out of here.

Well, let's have some decor.

Medulla bell.

And maybe we get a little married.

What do you say, pickleman?

Well, first Chastady has to die so that I can then be.

Chastady, what's her ETA on this?

Oh, it's done.

Really?

Oh, there she goes.

Oh, oh, and she's gone.

Yeah.

Oh, my Chastady.

Oh, it's fine.

She'll get over.

Jesus said it is finished and Chastady said it's done.

She's done.

She's very crumpled on the floor, Scott.

All right.

So, uh, if you want to have a ceremony here, I mean, it wouldn't be the, wouldn't be the first wedding ceremony, I believe.

Okay.

Don't make it not special.

All right.

Oh, have a knife on the look down upon this union.

It's my favorite time.

Oh, that's so a lot out of me.

That's it.

You're breathless again, Father.

But he's honey.

Branson, Branson.

Oh, God.

You're out of breath already.

You take heaven's song in 15 years.

Really?

What a joyless life you've had.

Yeah, it sucks.

Branson.

Yes, Father.

Look upon your breath.

I'm looking.

And say to her, Oh, I wish you love you like nobody's business.

I wish you love you like nobody's business.

Such loose vowels.

You say it's constant.

A little bit of calamity.

I do have a bit of a leak going on from excitement.

Oh, Lestra.

Now then, Medulabelle.

Yes.

Look upon your beloved.

Yeah.

And repeat after me.

Oh, I shall love you until the day that I die in a fortnight and a half.

I love you.

Love you.

Oh, I shall love you until the fortnight ends.

And then the blood gets transferred back and forth.

I think she's scaring on this.

She's going rogue.

Do we need people?

She's got into full scat, Father.

She's a scat.

Well done.

And is that the...

I will finish the ceremony.

Will you do it with me?

Of course, yeah.

Oh, do see the wedding.

I like to see people in love.

The end.

Father, Mother, am I married?

Yeah.

Oh, we said the end.

No, but I mean, I said the end means.

What does the end mean?

It means the end, Mother, you're out.

I thought I was just being joined.

So nothing happens between the two parties involved.

Let me go to St. Knives for the honeymoon.

Oh, okay.

That's why you have these shitty cats.

I guess I mean, like, the You May Kiss the Bride part.

Maybe that's not traditional.

Why would they kiss?

No, no.

You're so cute.

Kiss me the Bride.

You may kiss your mother.

Go to hell.

I'm the bride.

You may go to hell.

Here we go.

On each other.

One sec for you, little...

You little...

You got the...

Of a chastity spotty.

And the trowel.

Okay, here we go.

Wrap it around.

Yup.

Sounds like me when I'm eating a Thomas' English muffin.

Yup.

And...

I came.

Are they going to be...

How do we have to do two whole licks?

This one's a keeper fatter, Mother.

That's what I say after eating a Thomas' English muffin.

One, two licks.

And this one's a key for Mother.

Well, guys, this is beautiful.

I mean...

What's more beautiful than cross talk?

Thomas' English muffin.

She asked an answer.

Number one, two.

There you go.

I mean...

We said it was going to happen and it did.

We are...

Psychic.

I think.

It's not how I was thinking of it, but...

You're right.

About what we were going to do.

I was thinking we were as good as our word, but...

I think you're right.

We're just psychic.

What we said did come to pass.

Would you be considered psychic if you predicted things you were going to do and then you just did them?

You got to do them though.

You got to do.

You got to do them.

Or else you'll be a fraud.

That was a fun episode.

You enjoyed that one?

I had so much fun.

I love playing...

I love just being with those guys.

And Kirby is somebody that I've only gotten to play with a few times.

She's wonderful and so funny and it was great.

For me, it was such a fun combination of people.

Yeah, it was a great combo of people.

I don't think...

Did you know Kirby before hand?

I met her a bunch of times.

You met her a bunch of times.

Yeah.

It was just one of those great combinations.

Sometimes in booking the show, as the person who books it, I always try to find a fun combination of people and sometimes it's good to pick people who have worked together.

You look like you're nodding off.

No, I'm emphatically nodding.

You're emphatically nodding.

They look very similar.

You look as if what I was saying was the most boring thing you would ever heard.

It's a midnight mass nod off where you catch yourself in your head.

MNO.

So we...

It's stick to your own side of the street.

I tried...

Sometimes I try to book people who have worked together a lot and that can be the ease of relationship between the people can lead to a really fun episode.

But then sometimes people who have never worked together just magic happens.

And then sometimes you do either one of those and it's terrible.

Yeah.

And those episodes are not on the best sales.

Mm.

We'll see.

By the way, Kevin texted me a bit of information in the prequel comic to Justice League gods and monsters.

Joe Chill is the right hand man of Lou Moxon.

When Batman corners them during a meeting with the other crime lords, he kills Lou Moxon and drinks Joe Chill's blood.

What?

This is an alternate universe take, I believe.

Thank you for that information, Kevin.

All right.

Brake drinks his blood.

I don't know that okay, so I've hated a few people in my life.

Personality conflicts, obviously.

Sure.

I don't think that I would, as much as I dislike someone, I don't think I would find any pleasure in drinking their blood.

I don't want to drink any blood.

Any blood.

I don't drink any blood.

People I love and I love them which includes their blood.

And you love them.

Sorry, you have to drink their blood.

I love you, you know.

When I love someone, I love all of them.

I love their organs.

Yeah, especially one in particular.

Right?

No, when I love someone, even a friend, it means I love their sexual organs.

Can you say that to a friend and have it not be weird in this climate?

I love you from your fingertips to your vagina.

To your vagina.

I love organs of generation.

Alright, that's going to do it for us for part one, but look, part two is just around the corner coming up in a few days.

And all around the clock.

On Thursday, we're the fudge is made.

And it is, we're going to, on Thursday's episode, part two, we are going to be counting.

We're going to finally get into the single digits.

So we're going to hear, get into the single digits.

Yeah.

But let's tell you what, this will be fun.

Silver Sun pickups came on.

Tell you what, tell you what, Silver Sun pickups came on and you heard their voices certainly talking, but what if we heard them singing?

Let's close out the episode.

They were so nice, they were nice enough to get into the, into the episode and they also got into it.

They sent a message wondering if they should campaign for their episode as well.

Oh, so, and by the way, you're allowed to do that.

You are.

You have not done it in recent years.

No, you did it.

No, it's a long time.

You do it.

You used to go out there and campaign for certain episodes.

Yeah.

I think the only- I was having voted in many years.

I used to vote.

You used to vote and try to jack up your stats.

Yeah, I would just vote for all my episodes.

Of course I would.

Why wouldn't I?

You do the same.

You haven't did it.

The only person I believe that, that put out a call for people to vote for their episodes was Thomas Biddle Ditches here.

Oh, really?

Yeah, we'll see how that ended up.

Let's play one of the songs that Silver Sun pickups played in their episode.

This was cut from the episode.

So this is a treat.

No, this is in the episode.

No, no, it was not cut.

No, I've never heard of it.

So if you're not into music, turn it off right now and consider this to be the end of the episode.

But this is a great song.

Let's hear a little bit of Silver Sun pickups and we'll see you on Thursday.

Okay.

Bye.

It's a new time.

It's never worth my time.

Blue shine bleeds into my eyes.

And I still sleep on the right side while the white noise can leave the scene behind.

Could I be anything you want me to be?

So is meant to be saying right.

When you see yourself in a crowded room, do you think I said, shall you pass the way?

When you step in line or at least I could, can you fall asleep with a panning switch?

You see yourself in a crowded room, do you think I said, shall you pass the way?

When you step in line or at least the way, do you think I said, shall you pass the way?

So now try to hold on tight tonight.

I'm a big slip, inviting me inside, want a bright skin.

And brown wine was mine, but the red fuse, keep repping that invite.

If I go anywhere you want me to go, how will I know you still can follow?

When you see yourself in a crowded room, do you think I said, shall you pass the way?

When you step in line or at least I could, can you fall asleep with a panning switch?

You see yourself in a crowded room, do you think I said, shall you pass the way?

You see yourself in a crowded room, do you think you said, shall you pass the way?

Waiting, fading, floating away Wait, fading, floating away Wait, fading, floating away Wait, fading, floating away Wait, fading, floating away When you see yourself in a crown handroom Do you think I said sure you pissed or went?

Will you step in line or release that glitch? Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?

See yourself in a crown handroom Do you think I said sure you pissed or went?

Will you step in line or release that glitch? Do you think she'll sleep with a panic?

Do you think I said sure you should be a mess? Do you think I said sure you should be a mess?

Do you think I said sure you should be a mess?
