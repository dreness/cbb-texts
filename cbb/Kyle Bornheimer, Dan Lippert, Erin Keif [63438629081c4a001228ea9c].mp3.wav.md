♪♪♪ There are two wolves inside you stop eating wolves!

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Curious.

Thank you to FIFILO FUM for that catchphrase submission.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week, and special second week of October edition.

It only comes around once a year, and we are so glad it's here now.

And an exciting show.

By the way, my name is Scott Ocarman.

That's not part of the exciting show.

The exciting part of the show is our guests.

Coming up a little later, we have an author.

We also have a professor.

So people who are used to words and instructing people with words and using harnessing words much better than I'm doing right now.

So that'll be coming up a little later on the show.

But before then, guys, celebs are back!

Celebs are back on the show.

We had a rough couple of years.

We had some Zoom years where celebs were like, yeah, if I don't have to leave my house, yeah, sure, I'll do your stupid show.

I won't record myself properly.

I won't buy a nice mic and you'll be stuck with shitty audio.

So we had some celebs on the show for a little while, but then there was just a fallow period where no one wanted to come to my backyard.

And now celebs are back, baby, and they are here in the studio with us right now.

One in particular.

You know him.

He's our old friend. You know him from such shows as Worst Week.

You know him from movies like She's Out of My League.

You know him from probably other stuff, but the rest of his resume, I won't get into it here, but he has two incredible projects of importance coming out this week.

Season 2 of Avenue 5 on Sunday and a new show called High School, coming out at the tail end of this week.

We're so excited to talk to him.

He of course is Patrick I believe in sports circumference from the Comedy Bang Bang television show.

Please welcome back our friend, Kyle Bournai.

Hello Kyle.

Thanks. By the way, those two credits are the only ones I remember too.

That is, that is, yeah.

I was really struggling.

No, and I do.

And you're in everything, but I cannot remember like.

No, those are the only ones I remember filming, shooting, seeing, or than anyone liked.

Westworld.

I just saw you in Westworld.

Mm-hmm.

Pop up in Westworld.

Are you brutally murdered or?

I can't say, but I'm a douchebag.

If I'm a douchebag.

When you can't say, this is season one by the way.

So it's not like there are spoilers.

Those are the first episodes of season one.

I really, you know, there's someone out there that I don't want to ruin it for them.

No, I don't think I could, oh wait, you know what I do.

I think I do get, no, I slaughter someone in it.

You kill, you kill robots, right?

I kill, I kill little, little Jimmy Mars in it.

When you leave a set, is it just pretty much like washing your hands of it going like, I'm never going to remember any of this anymore.

Do you give me shit?

I just have a horrible memory in general and I feel sad about it.

Like there's a memory.

People that go to someone's house and they have photos from like their adventures on set and like selfies.

Hashtag set life.

Yeah, hashtag set life.

I just don't, I got to honor that more.

As I get older, I'm worried that I don't have it like, I don't have any memory.

Well, you know, when you're an actor like yourself who does like, you know, pops up on one episode of something instead of doing a lot of episodes of one thing.

Yeah.

It would be weird.

Yes.

As I think it was.

You know, a day player essentially.

A day player, under five guy.

Well, the weird if I honored too much.

They're like Kyle, you came in and...

We don't even remember your own.

Why do you?

No, but of course we love you on so many of our shows and I've talked about this on previous episodes about how I always had a fondness for you, especially on worst week.

And I was like, I like that guy.

I like that guy.

And then I forgot how you got on this show, but I remember I was like, I like that guy.

I want him on the show.

And here you are.

It's my fourth time, 34th time.

I know you're a regular at this point.

Yeah.

Very funny guy.

And let's talk about some of these proggies.

You know what I mean?

Because this is like your week.

Yes.

I just got back from the Toronto Film Fest with one of them, which is a TV show at a film fest.

This is a 70.

20, 22 is crazy.

This doesn't make any sense.

Wow.

So that has to be Avenue Five, right?

No, that one was high school.

That one was high school.

High school, obviously.

And I am excited about this show.

I want to talk to you, but I want to drill down on it because it's, first of all, it's on something called freebie.

Yeah.

So what the...

Kyle, you got to help me out here.

What is the ad?

The ad should be what the fuck is freebie?

Yeah, freebie is Amazon's new ads.

Whenever I say this, I feel like I am saying the exact thing.

I was told this Amazon is freebie is Amazon's new ad supported service.

Also, you're doing a commercial for them and you should be getting paid for that.

Yeah.

You should...

This shouldn't be your job.

You know what I mean?

You get paid to do the show and you should be like, oh, yeah, it's on something we've heard of.

I don't know if I got paid to do the show to be honest with you.

But instead, they're giving their advertising budget, they're keeping it and then making you explain freebie to everyone.

Yes, and you're participating in this sham.

Fuck!

I have a me on this podcast.

Shit!

And I refuse to go to your backyard for it.

So let's not even talk about freebie.

No, that's not...

No, because that should be...

That's Amazon too.

Until I'm sure of my deal and if it includes free advertising, I'm not going to mention...

Just blank blank.

Yeah.

You can mention it.

Yeah.

Okay.

I'm going to pause whenever I'm about to say it and you please just say it.

If you don't know what freebie is, that's Amazon's fault.

Yeah.

Not ours.

Right.

But I think this podcast...

Or mine.

Yeah, so that is their new free service and actually there's a great show on it right now.

Just launched at sprung shows on there, which is Greg Garcia in his show about with...

About based on the Sir Mixlelette song?

Yeah.

The movie based on the song.

It's a TV version of the famous movie.

And no, it's based on Teigen and Sarah's childhood in the 90s.

It's not high school.

High school is based upon my beloved Teigen and Sarah.

Guests on the Comedy Bang Bang television show, they did the Alfred Hitchcock episode, their delights.

They also guested on Take My Wife, which I produced.

Great people.

Great musicians.

They wrote a book together.

Yes.

Is that possible?

Well, every other word would add...

Well, every other chapter and they did it from each... they didn't check in with each other.

So Teigen didn't know what Sarah was writing and Sarah didn't know what Teigen was writing.

Chapter to chapter.

Until when?

At what point did they...

They still haven't.

And they will not.

They're trying to mind-mill that they're really like, well, I just know it.

Shouldn't I am your twin?

No, they... so yeah, it's about their high school experience, which was a combination of them discovering music, finding their sexuality, getting heavily into substances.

Like, what are we talking?

Crack cocaine?

Yeah, it's all about the crack cocaine epidemic of Calgary in 1998.

Yeah, they... and so... and really kind of finding themselves.

And it's a neat, neat, very sweet, tender story and set in the 90s.

So the music is... I mean, if you're a nerd like us, that loves...

They're like, they blew the budget on that.

Yeah, it's over and over.

We're only a lot of 90s grunge fans, but they weren't real deep divers.

They didn't know anyone on the...

It's like the people's popular song.

So you play, if my information is correct, you play the father of twins.

Yeah, I'm the father of twins. Technically, they're stepdad.

I guess not technically, but...

Oh, okay.

So you're...

Actually, they're stepdad.

Your sperm was not involved in the brain.

No, no.

And then the first episode is all about explains that.

How babies are made.

Well, let me show you how sperm is made first.

It's a really neat opening, sort of like the beginning of a tree of life that just shows all that.

And then it just hard cut to two teenagers in the 90s.

But it was...

Are you a good stepdad to them or you're a good stepdad?

It's so funny that the assumption with the step parent is that they're an evil...

Well, you... step-sumerate.

I mean, you've played a murderer, a robot murderer on Westworld.

Right.

So you can play either side.

Yeah, I can play...

Robot murders or good step-ups.

But a guy like me, I don't want to see you being a bad stepdad to take it in Sarah.

I don't want that.

I didn't want it either.

And then the two girls that play them that they found on TikTok, who had never acted before, or played instruments, who not only had a...

It sounds like a bad plan.

Well, they're horrible.

And they're horrible.

Okay, well, and we were like, next time let's give people an act and who can play music.

It was a real leap they took and...

It did not work out.

Oh, that's what a gamble's for.

Yeah, really, and season Gilliland, who play Tegan and Sarah, are...

I mean, I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of Tegan and Sarah in high school.

Like, I would have been so intimidated.

We grew up around the same time.

And it's similar.

Like, they grew up in small...

Calgary is not that small.

I grew up in like a small town in Indiana.

But discovering all that 90s indie rock and trying to deep dive after I really got into it.

And you were cooler if you liked the bands that nobody else knew about.

And it was that era of that.

Fans like Pearl Jam.

Yeah, yeah.

And Sound Garden.

And Stone Temple pilot.

So I don't know why saying it like that makes it sound more exotic.

Yeah, so I was in love with that era.

I couldn't have asked for like a better world to jump into.

Earth.

Earth, yeah, better Earth.

It's better.

It's tough when you do stuff like the Martian.

You gotta wear that spacesuit the whole time.

You gotta wear it in a different world.

13.

It's like, come on guys.

I wanted to stay.

I said, if it's on Earth and it's set in the 90s, I'll do it.

And so...

Those are your...

Those are my things.

But I will not do free advertising for you.

No.

Blank blank.

And by the way, Westworld does fall under that because it's set on Earth but set in the 1890s.

Yes, yes.

So they got you on a technicality there.

By the way, I love the music of 1890s too.

Right.

Yeah.

Those are your two eras.

My darling Clementine is one of the real staples of...

Player pianos.

Yeah.

But yeah, so...

I don't know what the question was but I don't know.

So how many EPs are we talking?

We're talking about an eight-up situation.

About eight.

I think they're dumping...

Is that the word?

Dumping.

They're dropping two or three to...

I don't think dumping is bad.

I don't think you dump.

No, yeah, dump would be bad.

They're exalting.

They're launching.

I think three episodes on October 14th, I believe.

Sounds like three episodes on October 14th.

Yeah.

Yeah, there you go.

Listen, I told you they don't pay me for the advertisement.

So three episodes and then a weekly...

And then a weekly I think after that.

Mm-hmm.

When you finish an eighth episode or you ever like you turn everyone on set and you go like, let's just go to nine.

Yeah.

I didn't have them hard to do that.

Apparently they would have needed a script and a bunch of other stuff but I didn't know how it worked.

I was like, guys, let's just keep going.

Let's go.

I got somebody.

We got a good thing going over here.

Yeah.

What just happened in the 90s?

Let's do something with the real world.

Mr. Gorbachev, do you know?

Oh no, that was the 80s.

Shit.

No, they'll fix it.

They'll fix it in post.

Yeah.

Gorbachev tore down something else.

Gorbachev, we lost Gorbachev.

We did.

We lost it.

We did.

Terrible.

Terrible day.

Yeah.

Although I hear he's with the Queen's Double on New Disc Beaches.

Mm-hmm.

This is a reference to an earlier episode.

Yeah.

But...

Can we cut to that clip?

Yeah, here we go.

So high school is the title of it and do they use their music to score scenes or are they playing songs?

Well, the really neat thing is there's a combination of, again, a very good combination of no 90 songs, some real deep dive, deep cut 90s songs.

I actually teared up just at the music because it's a very nostalgic for me.

What I understand, music soothes the savage press.

It's the food of life.

What's the thing?

It's the drink of the soul.

Food of the soul, yeah.

It's the elixir of love.

I don't know how that works.

I don't know.

But it worked for this show.

They were smart to add music in this show about musicians.

Usually when I watch a show, it's just dead silence and you hear every footstep.

Yeah.

And that's how they started.

They did a cut like that and it didn't work.

Contingents there were like, you might...

Maybe I'm like weird musicians.

Yeah, yeah.

But it's a slow burn to their discovery of that in themselves.

They didn't feel it out about themselves.

So it's a neat little thing.

The girls actually actresses learn as Tegan and Sarah did as they pick up guitars and learn.

So Tegan and Sarah's music is slowly integrated into it.

Then you get this great mix of the more popular smashing pumpkins.

It actually does a really great Tegan and Sarah did a great version of today.

Oh, great.

That's plays in the trailer.

That's really sweet.

And then...

My favorite version of that is the smashing pumpkins version.

Yes.

Yeah.

They did a good job with that.

It's a really good job to be original.

But yeah, no, it's a really wonderful...

It's half hour looks beautiful.

It kind of reminds me of 90s independent films that it sort of draws on.

Wow.

How did you...

Are you offer only or did you audition?

I met...

Because I know someone who auditioned.

Let's talk about that.

But it sounds like a waste of his time if they just offer it to you.

I went through a rigorous and it was a very competitive audition process.

I was very honored with all the people that I got to audition along with.

No, I think they gave it to me very early and then they had a lot of people audition for months and months after that.

Yeah.

This happened to my other friend.

He auditions for Jepetto in that Pinocchio movie that just came out about a month ago on Disney Plus.

And then he goes, oh, I wonder who got this part?

Tom Hanks.

You must have been talking with a pretty high level friend of yours.

No.

I'm going to go inside with the Jepetto role.

So it just doesn't make any sense.

But this is incredible.

High school is out this week.

Now let's pivot and talk about Avenue 5.

There's a name I haven't heard in Nia upon years.

Well, it's where COVID...

COVID shutdown.

We were COVID delayed.

Yeah.

This is an HBO comedy created by Armando Iainucci.

Is that how you say his name?

Yeah.

The guy behind Veep and in the loop and...

Yeah.

And it's all about...

I mean, in my opinion, it should be called Wacky Spaceship.

Wacky...

That's a better name for it.

That's much better.

Because Avenue 5, it's like, what even is that?

But Wacky Spaceship...

Wacky Spaceship Adventures, FaceTime.

Yeah.

But tell us about that because you got incredible people in the cast.

I mean, that's Hugh Laurie and Zach Woods and Jessica St.

Clair.

You do a lot of your scenes with this person named Jessica Zeepler.

Me and Joe, Jessica.

Jessica.

I do, but fans of the show have never heard her.

We have this person named Marissa Wampler.

Yo, that's right.

You've never been on the show.

Right.

And Marissa and Jessica would really love each other.

Yeah, they're very similar.

Yeah.

Almost to where they're exactly the same person.

You've just never seen them in the same room?

One percent louder.

And that would be Jessica.

Yes, exactly.

Yeah.

And Jessica and I are very loud in the show.

We are the assholes on the...

Imagine being stuck on a spaceship that gets lost in space for nine or ten months and there's a couple that's always bickering and at each other's throats.

Because you guys were getting divorced, doesn't it?

Yeah, in the first episode, in the first season, we were planning our divorce because we were about to land the next day.

We were so sick of each other.

And then we discovered we were going to be stuck in space together for six months.

But in season two, there's a little twist on that, which is...

Oh, I bet you guys fall back.

Wow!

Sexy memes.

Yeah.

There is a sexy in of sorts, but it's not...

Just a full on euphoria type.

It drugs in sex scene with Jessica St. Clair.

I'm looking forward to this.

Yes.

This would be the centerpiece of their ad campaign.

Yes.

So, Avenue 5...

I mean, you got to catch up on it if you didn't watch the first season.

Yeah, you can get it on HBO.

I guess it's just HBO Max now.

They haven't taken down all the other ones.

HBO Max.

Oh, you know what?

Actually, who knows?

By the time this posts...

At this point.

HBO might not even be a thing.

So, you might just have to go to all send you some of the dailies that I got.

Oh, that would be great.

That might be the only option at some point.

Okay.

Avenue 5, and it comes out this Sunday, another 10 apps.

You ever be on set and like the...

You do episode 10, you're like, let's just do 11.

You know, that's a great question.

I did.

And suggested that.

I'm trying to remember my previous bit.

Well Kyle, this is your week, buddy.

This is...

It's all going to happen for me.

It's so exciting for you.

I am so excited for you.

I'm thrilled for you.

To see the work that you put into your craft and to watch it pay dividends this week, this is exciting for me as a fan.

Well, thank you.

And if it doesn't pay dividends, it's...

That's true.

Back to India.

Yeah, both of these shows are canceled within the next month.

Which is my track record.

You know, very well be the case.

Back to just shooting robots for one episode and dipping out.

Well, this is great.

Kyle Bournimer is here and we need to take a break if that excites you.

Even if it doesn't, we're still going to do it.

But when we come back, we have a professor is going to be here.

Did you ever go to school?

I'm a dropout.

Yeah.

I mean professors have a strained relationship.

Yeah.

Did you say mean professors or just me and professors?

Me and professors.

Yeah.

It's tough, right?

Me professors would be interesting to me.

Like...

Me and professors.

This is your next show.

Me and professors.

You've heard of bad moms.

Yeah.

Me and professors.

And it's just them being kind of cranky and like...

I'm listening to you after class.

And then apologize.

Yeah, I'm sorry.

It's a guy.

It's a network show that needs a happy ending.

Very nice guy.

We're going to come right back.

We have a professor and a little later an author.

We'll have more from Kyle Bournimer.

More comedy bang bang.

We'll be right back after this.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back.

Kyle Bournimer, our old friend with his fourth appearance here.

You're a member of the Four Timers Club.

Who else is in that?

Actually, I think we've got a lot of Bournimer.

Yeah, a lot of people.

Yeah.

It's not that big of a...

Certainly.

Vrner Herzog.

Castro.

Castro, yeah.

Fidel Castro.

Certainly.

I was trying to think of people that would be on...

What's his name?

Put that mic right at your mouth.

What do you say?

I know you're drinking something, but you haven't pointed to your chest.

No, people like a lot of noises, a lot of mouth noises and plastic hitting plastic on the mic.

And then hearing people talk like this above the mic.

I don't know how anything I would want to see.

It's so you know.

You don't have to bend down to it.

One of my least...

Now I'm so self-conscious I don't know.

It's my first day in Hollywood.

Which is how every voiceover audition is for me.

I forget how to act every time a microphone is in front of me.

It's daunting though.

Anytime you get to a new set, if you've never done the show before it's like, oh, am I going to get fired?

Do you still feel that way?

Are you like, I'm going to slip on the old Bournimer.

Yeah.

I think each one's different, but for the most part I'm pretty sure.

It's usually after that I'm convinced I won't get work again.

When I've gotten in, I know that they're too busy to fire me at least the first day.

Yeah.

I'm usually like, after I leave I'm like, well, they're cutting that out.

Yeah, yeah.

I get a lot of, well, that'll do after a take.

We have to move on.

I did a recent project which is coming out around the end of the month, I believe, the Weird Al movie.

Oh, very excited about that.

And I got two takes and I was like, is that because I was bad or because I was good?

Yeah, yeah.

I'm convinced because it was bad and they gave up.

Yeah, I think that's where our minds always go.

I think there's about three actors that are like, got it on the second one, should we move on?

Yeah, like Segal, like Stephen Segal's that way, but that's out of pure lazyness.

Yeah.

Well, this is incredible.

Two shows out this week.

Four times on this show, two shows in a week, a lot of math, but I'm wrapping my head around it.

Avenue five as well.

So many numbers.

Yeah.

So many numbers.

High school has four years in it.

Yeah.

You're a math guy, aren't you?

When you like numbers and puzzles or you like, I know there's a thread on this show whenever numbers are involved, you sort of perk up and you get excited.

Oh, that's the only time I ever get excited about this show.

You're going to be able to get a real drag for you.

You really, you know, although I will say we're in our 14th year.

So every episode, I'm like, Oh, 14th year.

So I do get excited every episode.

It's an even number.

I'm sure this is like a great year.

This is such a good year.

We have to get to our next guest.

I hope they are having a great year themselves.

They are a professor of what I do not know.

I do not have this information in front of me, but it, all I have to do is ask once I introduce them.

Welcome to the show Lloyd Garterbelt.

Greetings, kind sir.

Shake my hand like a gentleman.

Oh, okay.

Ah, yes, a sperm grip.

I see you know your judo well.

I am firm.

You have the limpest handshake that I've ever.

I am giving food muscle from forearm on this grip, my good man.

Let me check those out.

This is limp to you.

This is limp to me.

This is as strong as one can go.

This is as limp as the very biscuit upon Fred.

First.

I don't even know how to finish this.

Oh, you said.

You're just saying a pod.

I don't know.

I like to jump pay.

How are you?

Lloyd Garterbelt.

I very well and shake my hand, my good man.

Okay.

Get ready.

Yes, very good.

That is a little off putting.

No, and a very strong handshake from Kyle Berry.

Where are you from?

What audience are you?

I want it to depends on.

You're saying a word and it just is like, doesn't have any relationship to the word you meant?

A crossing of line wires in our brain.

Certainly.

What do you think I meant?

What, uh, personality?

How recently?

Why consider other countries to be just audiences?

Ah, yes.

Because I've done so many tours.

Which audience are you?

Is which two would I have seen you off with?

Six.

Where are you from?

I have traveled from this great world to and fro near and far that I don't call nowhere home no more Scott.

It's interesting because you have sort of like an English accent but then you're doing things like doing double negatives like a common person but you have more of a lofty accent.

It's interesting.

And it's a breadth of all my experiences at one for I have had to move from place to place due to academia.

It sounded like Sean Connery right then.

Interesting.

Well, if consistency is what you're looking for with me a good man, consistency you will not get.

I see.

But this is my voice and it will.

Well, that's a thing.

I mean, people just have the voices they have.

Sometimes they sound like something and then sometimes they sound like nothing.

Does that make sense?

Today you and I are vibing.

I understand everything you're saying.

Even if you're not understanding it as a student of humanity.

We also have been micro dosing this entire time.

Yes, that's not been helping.

To the extent that we are definitely macro dosing.

We're just dosing it this way.

Any more micro doses we may be macro dosing.

We'll be getting a cease and desist on that one.

I'm sorry.

I haven't offered you any.

Do you want any of our LSD?

I did some before we came, but it was so micro that I'm not even sure.

Yeah.

Have a feel.

I don't know how micro to go when I when I micro dosing.

I know that's the problem.

Yeah.

You can always grow bigger, but you can never go back.

My good plan.

So you say you select that based on smallness.

And if you're not feeling too high or too energetic, please take some more of my.

I guess I will.

LSD.

Turn on, tune in, draw, draw.

This is a good lesson for life.

You can always have more of something, but you can never have less.

So it's like when you're eating, for instance, it's like order the small portions.

I tell you, I went to a restaurant the other night and they came up to the table and they said, have you ever been here before, which you know that they're about to describe small plates to you.

Right?

So, so that happened.

They did.

And they go like, we encourage sharing at our restaurant, which is like, Oh, you would encourage us.

And they go about four plates for two people is about right.

And it's like, Oh, okay.

So you want us to spend more money than normal.

Okay, got it.

So they're like, we encourage a bunch of stuff.

We ordered four things and on the fourth thing, the person said, that's a very small portion.

And my point is like, well, then make it a regular size portion.

Don't offer it.

If it's, if it's a small, you know, and you're the one who told me to order four things.

100% I encourage the chef to make a goddamn bigger plate because I've come here just to eat a meal.

A succulent Chinese meal.

And by the way, it was a perfect size of a portion.

And so they, so they were alive.

If you were going to order three other things for three, I see.

Well, that's, I'll say it right now.

That restaurant is it is democracy manifest.

It is our country is going down the toilet.

And this is yet another example.

Wouldn't you agree?

Yeah, I guess so.

Carl would I mean, I wasn't going to go there.

I would just think in that their particular restaurant model was, you know, maybe one that I wasn't my favorite.

Yeah, I was just talking about a restaurant.

I know democracy.

And this is the issue.

This podcast in itself is comedy manifest.

And this is why I'm here, Scott Ockerman.

You are pointing this.

Who are you?

I am Lloyd Gardebelt.

I know, but that doesn't explain who you are.

I have arrived here because our culture is in the proverbial toilet Scott Ockerman.

Everything from media to restaurateurs are responsible.

And it's making teachers and professors like me have trouble doing their jobs.

And I'm frequently being fired because children no longer understand the world in which we live.

I see.

Where do you, where do you profess?

Where do you teach?

I am currently between professions, but I was recently fired from Washington University in St. Louis for.

Washington University in St. Louis.

Are you not familiar?

I'm not familiar.

Why don't they call it St. Louis University?

Because that's in Washington.

They did a swap?

They did a swap.

They did a holiday.

Oh, two universities needed to find themselves and fell in love with the new world in which they found themselves and a world where much like how we fell in love with Cameron Diaz as an editor.

Oh, yes.

I've never seen this.

Oh, I can't believe it.

She plays an editor, an editor, a film trailer.

A film trailer.

One of the more relatable jobs for all these things.

Do you think she was ever editing the film trailers and like the director walks in and goes, oh, you should just be in these movies because you are beautiful and you're like an actress?

That was what we all imagined the deleted scenes of that film were.

And perhaps why she had to leave Los Angeles.

Oh, so I don't know about this film.

She leaves.

She goes to England to find herself after a breakup and some British.

Wait, someone breaks up with her?

You think that guy would like wander into the room about to break up and then look at her and go, oh, no, you look like Cameron Diaz.

Like we should still stay together.

Again, a deleted scene I imagined was her somebody saying, this is why movies don't make any sense, right?

Yes.

Because they always cast these beautiful people in them and then they give them problems.

This is Hollywood manifest Scott Ockerman.

And I hate to say it in front of a seasoned actor who's benefited so well from the Hollywood system looking wonderful, sounding wonderful, but ogos like myself no longer have a place in the American States of United America.

You're very ugly.

I meant to mention that when you.

You meant to mention that.

When I introduced you.

It wasn't on your bio, but I was just like a struck by it.

Of course it's not on my bio that I am ugly.

I you do not describe your looks upon your bio because you should know you should be judged for your heart and your thought.

What would they have done?

What other reason are their authors pictures on the back of book jackets for then to see if they're ugly or not?

That's so you look at the office picture on the jacket and then you're.

And then I decide whether to buy the book.

Do you ever buy an ugly author's book to see if they're writing is an evidence?

That's the only books I buy.

You think they'd be really good?

Because every other book it's like, you know what they're too busy.

I mean, I look for bad fashion or ugly.

Yeah.

And then I know that's probably in for a good read.

Yeah.

Lloyd, why are you here?

Because Scott Ockermann, I am here to stop you in your tracks with what you're doing here.

All right.

Podcast podcast is done.

No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not stopping doing the podcast.

Is that what you mean?

You must.

Like me, the, uh, little arty, the educated, the professors of this world are being pushed out by the generations listening to TikTok and listening to podcasts.

I don't know how.

Why were you fired?

Well, plenty of reasons.

Intellectual.

I don't like to hear that.

Usually it's just one.

So when a guy says plenty of reasons, it's like you have a problem.

Elimination is one I've been discriminated against for my wit for wanting to teach things that the young woke literati are not willing to read for describing female students outfits to the whole class.

Millions of things that you used to be able to do, but young 18 year olds won't allow it anymore because they need their bubble of safety, Scott Ockermann.

That's the thing.

We always want our teachers to be older than the students, right?

It would be weird if it was the other way around, right?

So just using like, okay, that's true.

If that is true, then these older teachers are going to be of a different mindset and have different sort of values.

And we should be accepting of that, right?

Otherwise every single teacher is going to be younger than the people that they're teaching.

And now you're speaking my language, Scott Ockermann.

If you want your teacher to be so in touch with the current society and aware of media, they must be younger.

Although in a society where you go to school, okay, kids, you're a kid, you go to school, half of your day is spent teaching kids who are older than you.

And the other half is kids that are younger than you teaching you.

This is not, I mean, this kind of makes sense as a society.

It's almost like a kabut school of some sort.

I don't know what that word is.

A kabut, a co-op of sorts, a commune in Israel started with the idea of an endemic society as an escape from the corners of Adolf Hitler.

I see, I see.

I don't know that we had to bring him into this, necessarily.

Well, what is the direct line from Hitler to Israel?

Any thoughts on Hitler?

I actually, where this is going.

I mean, Professor Oraly, you seem to be wise about some things.

You just described the origins of the kabuts.

Very well, thank you.

Thank you very much.

I'm incredibly wise.

And yet, my wiseness is not respected because we're limited to one, two, or three things we've said that have made students uncomfortable.

What are you going to give us examples?

Oh, let's see.

Let's see.

For example, I've painted myself into a situation here now.

It seems to me like you're the one who was fired.

I was fired for a multitude of reasons.

Number one, professors should be allowed to insult anybody who, based on their hair color.

For example, we know blondes are dumb.

So if you're describing something and a student says something not so wise and they're blond, you should be able to say, no surprise there.

But in this woke world democracy manifest, we are forced to never- We started this on Connery thing again.

It's just my voice.

It's like- Right, yeah.

As if I heard your voice, I thought you were doing an impression of somebody who sounds like you.

You can't something that I would have thought of before the show.

Who did your voice to like to- Voice to like?

Yeah, yeah.

Who do people say you sound like?

I don't know.

That's a good question.

I get a lot of people on Twitter, and this is my favorite thing about Twitter, who send you a picture of the ugliest person alive and then say, is this you?

Really love that.

What about when they draw you and say, hey, I did art of you.

What do they say?

I'm like, I'm like, did you forget my chin?

Are you really noticed my beard?

What are both of the things that you have, by the way?

Yes, I have a no chin and a bigger beard and I've been described by you as ugly, but by many as fascinating.

Well, by- As yourself as well.

You said that you were ugly.

That's all right.

Which is what makes me a good author is because I'm never having sex.

I'm thinking.

Right.

Because nobody will make love to me.

And if you say that in a college campus, you will be fired in 2022, Scott Ockerman.

I mean, this isn't- Look Kyle, you have children, right?

Yes.

And your children's teachers to be talking about hooking up with people or the assets of- I mean, depending on their age, I mean, you mentioned earlier that the children these days, is it just college that you've taught?

I mean, when you're between jobs, have you had to go to high schools or anywhere else?

Oh, they just wonder question.

I've taught preschoolers American history and I've taught high schoolers blocks and trees.

I mean, your children, your Hollywood children go to some sort of money.

On to sorority school.

Yes.

No, they're in a pod with just three other like-minded families.

We really like to try to keep it.

But although we might be losing our teachers soon.

No, I'm so sorry.

You know, I'm kind of a piece.

Oh, yes.

Sucks.

You're a good man.

Let's negotiate right now.

Money wise, I'd like to be tenured.

Immediately tenured.

Oh, wow.

I can transfer right to, yeah.

I don't know how that stuff works, but sure.

Wonderful.

I bet 35k a year.

35k a year.

I bet between the five of us, we might be able to scrape that.

Yeah, I mean, that's seven.

They're not the person.

Oh, yes.

I'm like, I understand.

Seven thousand.

That's like, you know, if you just consult on a sitcom, that's like one week's salary.

Well, sitcoms are paying you seven-year to consult on.

I'll do that as well as there any sitcoms of professionals.

Oh, yeah.

You should just do that.

How could we have a sitcom here brewing up this, this exactly?

You teaching a pod of kids in Hollywood might be a sitcom on its own.

A misunderstood racist.

Oh, is that how you're describing yourself?

Are we in the pitch meeting?

That's all I've been described.

Yes, you have to break it down in the pitch meeting.

Yeah.

Teachers, a group of young children are any other, and I hate Hollywood, and I hate, you know, the celebrity culture, but are there any other big name parents?

Yeah.

Sean Connery's grandkids are actually in the pod.

Oh, wow.

Yeah.

Speaking of Sean Connery and Dick Cabot's grand.

It's all great.

It's my kids and then a bunch of old Hollywood grandkids.

I don't know how that ended up that way.

Well, I would be happy to teach royal grandchildren.

You know, so Sean Connery has been mited, correct?

Yes.

Does that transfer down to his grandkids?

I think so.

I think they're two.

You just pass.

Yeah, once he dies, right?

It just passes right down.

Wow.

And are they bonds as well?

Yeah, that never goes away as well.

I would be happy to join your pod, but you have to agree.

You have to agree with me.

No rules.

Just right.

We can start it off that way and I'll see where you go.

I mean, you know, maybe there'll be some lively debate.

They can, you know, that might be what's going on here.

If the kids are going back to college, if they are offering you alternative points of view to yours, why are you worried about engaging with those?

I am happy to engage with alternative points of view, but I should be allowed to speak my mind freely in a debate with a child, an adult, or anybody at all, even if it's getting drinks with them after class or whatever.

What kind of debates are we talking about?

Like, should we role play one of these debates and see exactly like what the types of things you say?

I would love to role play.

I have dipped my toes into the art of...

You've taught improv?

What level?

Well, you know, basic level improv stuff, mostly short form.

You know, games within that world.

Yeah, so basically, like anytime anyone, you do freeze tag, anytime anyone's near someone's butt, freeze!

I see you know you're improv!

I know you're improv.

Yes, very good Scott.

Okay, so, okay, so say Kyle is one of your students.

Really?

What age do you want to be, Scott?

Let's go back to college.

I'll be interested.

Yeah, we're at where this whole thing started.

So you're a college student of mine, one of my four-year schools, you've started college?

I'm Leon.

Leon.

All right, and are you Leon Phelps, the Tim Meadows character?

Are you the professional?

No, we're the only one.

Yeah, I'm Leon.

I'm a French American named Leon.

All right, okay, you're the student of mine.

And you're the son of an assassin.

Son of an assassin.

Oh, it's a legacy.

Yeah.

More milk, Leon.

What?

What's the major you offer you?

Well, thank you very much.

My dad loved milk before any of his kills.

So I really appreciate that, Professor Gardeberbel.

And wonderful.

Thank you for getting a drink with me at the 29 Cafe down the street from the universe.

Yeah, this is great.

A lot of my buddies and I come here and post our TikTok videos and do Mollie.

Oh, horseshit.

I don't believe in that quick fire media.

I watch the films of Godard and I read the novels of Shakespeare.

Oh, you know, Godard just died not too long ago.

Yeah, we took a class with him.

He was before my time, but like, yeah, he's not bad.

Oh, yes.

Oh, you kids these days, everything in black and white.

I cannot watch blah, blah, blah.

We were pretty okay with it.

You're an idiot.

And you're not educated and you need to learn.

Now that woman sitting next to you in class, what was her name?

Oh, yeah, Stephanie.

What's her story?

Well, I mean, I don't know her too well.

I mean, we've talked a little bit.

I try to, you know, respect her space.

She's really serious about studies.

So I don't really pick her.

That's the time to talk her up too much.

Oh, you got a flirt.

I don't know if that's the...

You got to flirt in class.

That's the point of college.

So, I know it's my good man.

I think she's there to learn.

And afterwards, she's very funny afterwards.

We've exchanged some thoughts.

Maybe at some point when the time is right, I might...

Oh, yes.

We love a woman with a sense of humor, us men.

Well, I don't know if all men do.

I certainly do.

Let's close this tab out.

We're about two blocks away from a strip club.

You and me poke our heads in and let's chat history.

Well, I mean, I think, you know, sex workers are a positive thing.

And if it's the type of club where they're, you know, they're unionized and the women are kind of calling the shots there, I'd be open to that.

Maybe we could bring a couple of my friends that are fluid and are interested in that.

And we could maybe do that.

Oh, and a huge eye roll to that whole sentence.

I'll go alone and I'm going to a different club called Star Gardens in North Hollywood.

And they will not allow the strippers to unionize there.

And that is where I support.

That's your thing, man.

You enjoy yourself.

Okay, so this...

You turn to me like this scene was over.

No, I'm still going this way.

Oh, you're so...

No, but I do want to interject here.

Three.

First of all, you're right by my answer.

Oh, great.

Okay, look.

First of all, Kyle, what an incredible scathing portrait of a woke college.

Didn't I really want to happen to those?

Yeah, you took them down a bit.

Yeah, yeah, great job.

As for you, Professor Gardebelt, you really do that much that was bad or fireable.

You called him an idiot, which I think you probably still could do as a professor.

You asked him to go to a strip club, which is probably still fine.

I mean, people, you know, I don't know.

You got fire for that?

Well, you know, I was...

And you encouraged him to flirt almost like you were a Cyrano de Berger, actually.

It was kind of a guy.

It was another romantic comedy.

We just came up with another show.

And I have been vindicated on the air of comedy bang bang, and I feel that perhaps...

Wait a minute, no, I just agreed with you.

Can I get canceled for this?

Absolutely you can.

It is so easy to cancel a man like you or I, Scott Ockerman, a man of the past.

Who is just trying to find our way through the modern ages.

A man of the present, maybe.

But...

You were not a man of the present I gave you when I arrived.

What?

I gave me a present.

I gave you a lovely present when I walked in.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I didn't.

Right in the trash.

Well, I mean, it was like an envelope from your car that he wanted me to throw in the trash, you said.

A gift, and it was a test, Scott.

You were supposed to look upon the envelope and see if it was something you wanted to throw away or to deceive.

What, Gardebell, can I tell you something?

I would love to hear it.

I am not quite getting your whole thing.

All right.

Let's take a moment.

It's not strong.

No, let's take a moment.

Let's break it down.

Okay, you're a professor.

Okay, that's good.

Yes.

All right.

But you come in here and you say you've been fired recently and then you can't remember why you were fired.

Yes.

And it takes you a minute to come up with stuff.

And then we role play like what would be, you know, and I'm expecting some really harsh things for you to do.

Right.

And it's kind of weak and tepid.

It's tepid.

Well, I suppose I have done some things that I didn't, as I, that I painted myself into a corner.

Then I was like, oh, you know what?

The type of person I am is hard to parody this day and age without saying that thing.

Yeah.

Almost as if like to parody him, you came up with a voice and that was it.

Well, well, not quite, not quite.

You know, the idea I had here with anything, the ideas who I am.

Sure.

Yeah.

But the idea of what you were going to talk about on the show.

Yes.

The idea was what we're talking about was, you know, the idea that a man like me, a man.

This is a good idea.

Yes.

But then no specifics.

Yes.

The specific.

Yes.

I will have to agree with you on that one.

Okay.

Usually I don't critique the guests in the middle of the segment, but I take it as a compliment that you feel comfortable enough.

I do feel very comfortable.

About.

And I feel like it's warranted.

And I feel, and here's how I feel.

I'll come right back on perhaps even the next episode.

Maybe next episode.

Hey, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre would.

Yes.

Well, let's just chill to the next episode.

Yes, of course.

Well, look, Lloyd, Gardebell, we're going to take a break.

If you can use any of that time while we do to come up with anything, that would be great.

If not, no harm, no foul.

I'll talk more, but have less to say.

I think we have a deal.

When we come back, we have an author.

This is very exciting.

We're going to come back.

We have more Lloyd Gardebell, more Kyle Bournimer.

We have, and both of those things are very hard to say.

If you're me, we'll be right back with more comedy, bang, bang after this.

We're back, Kyle Bournimer, Avenue 5.

Take that over to the high school.

This is the way he advertised two shows, right?

A Time Together like this, you know?

That way you get the fans of both.

They're watching both shows, suddenly double ratings.

Comedy, bang, bang.

Yeah.

Huh?

Anyway, but Avenue 5 this Sunday, high school this Friday or Thursday, one of those two.

One, four, 14.

Once you figure out what 3D is, the rest.

Yeah, it'll be all over everywhere.

The world opens up to you.

We'll be able to miss it.

We also have Lloyd Gardebell.

Lloyd, you do any thinking over the break?

Shoot.

Or did you just sit there staring into space?

Well, it's a beautiful space you have here to Scott Ockermann.

All right, well, let's get to our next guest.

They're an author.

This is exciting because I love the written word, and even words set aloud.

I like those too.

So words.

Words in general.

And they use the written word to their advantage.

I'll tell you that much, obviously because they're an author.

Please welcome to the show for the first time, Matilda Graveman.

Hello, Scott.

It's so nice to finally meet you.

Oh, when would we have met before?

Oh, I've never met you formally, but I wrote your unauthorized biography, and I was wondering if you could sign it.

Wait, you wrote my unauthorized biography?

Well, you didn't respond to my emails, but also I didn't know your email.

Yeah, where are you emailing?

Scott at ockermann.

Pretty close, actually.

Unfortunately for me.

Rats.

So close.

Yeah, too close.

Wait, so you wrote a biography of me?

Why is it?

Slams it down on desk?

Look at it.

You're providing your own sound effects?

Yeah, it's a very light book.

So I wanted to make it every day.

You need to make sure you're making impact with it.

Yeah.

Well, why is so light, by the way?

I've had an interesting enough light.

I know a lot, but I don't know much.

OK, what's the book called?

I can't see it from the past day.

I did it my way.

The life of times of Skip Anchorman.

There's a bit of a typo in the front cover.

Bit of a typo, yeah.

Plus, I did it my way.

That's like a Frank Sinatra.

I knew it sounded familiar.

Oh, rats.

Dang it.

Yeah, I mean, usually the title of a book has something to do with the career of the person.

Billy Joel, for instance, he would be vacillating between my life and piano man.

He'd be like, I don't know what the right title is.

I wrote his unauthorized biography as well.

What'd you call that?

I did it my way, the life of times of the show.

So you're the item of my way, personally, basically.

This is like that mystery author who does A is for whatever.

Exactly.

I've been writing biographies for about 60 years.

Not slowing down any time soon.

Call of a woman, Ari, if you don't mind me.

How dare you?

I'll say I'm in my early to late 80s.

So anywhere from 80 to 89?

Yes.

OK.

Great.

Yeah.

OK, well, welcome to this.

I mean, you may be the oldest guest we've ever had.

Oh, well, thank you.

In Santa Claus.

Oh, my goodness.

They're a mythical creature.

I wrote his unauthorized biography as well.

That whole bit about seeing you when you're sleeping.

Yeah.

You wrote that?

I wrote that.

But the full title is Seeing You When You're Sleeping.

I did it my way.

Oh, yeah, right, right, right.

So what's in the book about me?

Well, it opens, obviously, at the beginning of your life, a full moon in Arkansas, a farm.

In 1943, Scott Ocherman was born.

OK, none of these things are correct.

Oh.

I mean, maybe the full moon.

I wasn't clocking that at the time, but.

Yeah.

Well, I mean, to be honest, most of my research comes from reading over your shoulder at coffee shops when you open a computer.

And it's hard to see at my age, but I did the best I could.

You've been reading over my shoulder at a coffee shop?

Yes.

Oh, sort of when you're on your phone or you're typing away at a manuscript, I just sort of.

So I'm composing my tweets.

I know.

And I just keep some of those in your drafts.

And that's just me.

So you're not just a biographer.

You're a critic of my tweets.

Yeah, well, of course.

OK.

We all are.

So who gave you the contract to do this contract sign?

Who signs?

Where sign you sign?

I'm sorry.

What now?

I'm here.

Don't ask for forgiveness, not permission.

OK.

I've written probably around 6,000 biographies at this point.

I have not asked for anyone's permission, not once.

OK.

So who else have you written?

Mike Dukakis, Diane Keaton, John Adams.

The list goes on to time.

I'm sure it does.

But both three at the top.

It's all downhill from there.

Really have to unpack why I panicked said those three names.

That's for another day.

Out of the 6,000.

Yeah, I know.

But all right.

Well, let's read some of this book.

What's in this?

OK, I'm just going to flip around and then talk about some of my favorite bits.

Oh, I love this chapter.

This is when you moved.

Which chapter is this?

Chapter eight.

Eight.

OK.

And this is what?

When you move to New York City and you are pounding the pavement with resume in hand, tap shoes in the other hand.

And you were in the original cast of damn Yankees.

I can see it all in front of me.

Oh, it's how do you do?

Wow, strong handshake.

Yeah.

Why were you sitting in the shadows?

Not talking.

Oh, Batman, that's my thing now.

I am not miss iron the night.

He's been on the show already.

And I'll be back.

So kind of like a vampire.

Oh, that's my thing.

I can't go out.

I guess that's why.

The second week of October.

Oh, yes, my favorite of the month.

OK, you can just pay it into vampire to save a failing watchover here.

Well, then I'll be back.

All right.

So what happens in this chapter?

None of this is ringing a bell, by the way.

Really?

You don't remember trying to make it as a big star in New York City?

Just read it, though.

OK.

A full moon in New York City in the 1960s.

Scott Ockerman in a rat infested.

It was not alive at this point.

Oh.

Also your pro style.

He was a little bit to be desired.

But go ahead.

Yeah, does it sort of sound like narration at the beginning of a bad play?

I guess it's not even full sentences.

I'm sorry.

My eyesight's also not great, so I can't really read it.

Luckily, there's an optometrist in the room.

A vampire optometrist.

Oh, you love it.

Don't get too close when you're reading.

So is he working on people's eyes in order to bite their necks?

Yes.

That's Scott.

I don't know.

I am, I guess.

I don't know.

All right.

And then you met Gene Martin, Patti LaPone.

Huge note.

You're reading right now.

And you said, and you met.

This is book directed at me.

Am I the reader?

Well, I was hoping you would.

I mean, it would hurt my feelings.

Something awful if you didn't at least crack it open, Skip Akerman.

I'm sorry of my name.

I'm sorry, but none of this happened to be.

What do you mean?

I never moved to New York.

Yes, I own tap shoes, but I kept them here in the Sweet California, the Golden State.

You weren't pounding the pavement trying to become a star?

I'm sure I was, but only here in California.

Well, chapter 7 through 14 are useless now to rip them out of book.

That's our light pages.

Thank you for doing the sound effect.

I mean, so you've only gotten your information from reading over my shoulder?

Yes.

Also just dreams.

Dreams.

Talking to people who know you, interviewing people in your life.

Well, the people in this room, of course.

You talked to that was like right before you came on.

I did notice you were scribbling.

I thought you were signing the book.

Were you writing another chapter?

Yeah, you're the last chapter.

Congratulations.

Oh, wow.

I don't want to go back.

Do you mind reading from that, Kyle?

Yeah.

What did you say about me?

Well, I didn't say anything about you.

I just introduced myself.

So you really got in the book?

So it says here, kale sugar hams.

Sugar hams.

Nailed it on the first try.

I mean, that might be just her name.

Did Mel Gibson name you?

And it just says, well, then it goes into my biography.

Oh.

It says, I don't know if it's all you.

Is that where you were telling them?

In Czechoslovakia, right before the Soviets came.

I guess I'm.

So yeah, it really paints me as a kind of a war child.

Spoiler alert, you did it your way.

Yes, that's when it says here.

It says title ideas, but it says one, he did it his way, but put it in the I form.

I don't know what that means, but yeah.

OK, so the back of my book is just scribbling musings on what his book is going to be about.

Well, yeah, I didn't have another piece of paper.

Oh, I see.

OK, how many copies of this book did you make?

Well, there's at least like 400.

400.

But some of the chapters are out or I had to print myself and my hands hurt and my grandchildren hate me.

So I had no help.

Let's talk about that.

Why do you?

No, let's talk about you.

See, I spent my life focusing on other people.

So I didn't have to think about that.

You sound like such an interesting person, a person whose grandchildren hates them.

I mean, that's a story.

Well, whose grandchildren don't hate them?

I almost everyone.

Really?

Good relationship.

Yeah.

Well, I have a couple chapters about your relationship with your grandparents.

My way to say.

Well, you lived with them and then your grandmother taught you to play baseball in the full moon.

Full moon?

No one's playing baseball in the full moon.

Yeah, in the full moon.

The whole chapter in the baseball.

I mean, there are night games.

And then your grandpa turned into a ghost.

It became.

I don't know why I'm looking at you at a cosign of this.

Don't look at the vampire.

You're basically useless.

I love baseball.

I want a little bit of help from you.

I get nothing.

I can't wait to write your biography.

Someone who started as a professor and then pivoted really hard in the latter part of their life to vampire a farmer.

This is the latter part of his life?

Well, I'm just doing.

Hey, what's going to happen to him?

Oh, that tells you a thing.

I know when someone's going to die.

That's how I can write in their biography.

So did you know about Ken Starr a few weeks back?

Yeah.

Oh my god.

We guessed it.

We guessed it was going to happen.

Do you know that famous death that happened on October 3?

Last seven days ago.

Yes, it you.

Oh, fuck.

Wait, how did this happen?

He died a few days ago?

Yes.

I'm a ghost.

That's why I couldn't remember my thing when you moved into the afterlife.

You're moving on mentally.

Yes.

Oh, yes.

OK, my ghost thing is.

What's your twist on a classic ghost?

I love big old ghost tits.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Your kids are going to love this episode.

I get already cracking up right now.

You know, Scott, well, I have you.

I just want to, I need to, like, some help fill it in the blanks of stuff.

Sure.

First of all, you don't have me.

You're on my show.

Oh, go ahead.

No, wait.

OK, well, then why are we in my house?

Is this not in my house?

This is not your house.

No, this is the year we'll studio.

Rhett.

Dang it.

All right.

Well, not quite sure how you even got here.

But go ahead.

Well, me neither.

Is anyone's guess.

Sure.

You've been married eight times, yes?

Absolutely.

I've been married once for what seems like eight times.

Oh, right.

Because you're the Elizabeth Taylor of the podcasting world.

That's what people call you.

Not really.

Because of your gorgeous jewels around your neck and your eight marriages.

No, I mean maybe the jewels.

But no, I'm not even the Conan O'Brien of podcasting.

Who?

You've, wait.

So you've done a biography of me and you don't even know who Conan O'Brien is.

I'll write his biography right now.

Tell me anything about it.

I can write it.

Tall.

Created podcasting.

Tall created podcasting.

Who from the Harvard Lampoon to the Saturday night live, to the Simpsons, to his own talk show, which was maligned because nobody knew who he was.

And yet he managed to make it.

Well, thought you were going too fast.

Born on the full moon in Massachusetts.

Conan O'Brien.

Massachusetts is the mind of that part right now.

Dang it.

Oh, wait.

You're trying to get it.

No, no, no, no.

No.

He did it his way.

Fine.

You want to know how it ends?

He did it his way.

He actually did do it his way.

He did do it his way.

Yeah.

Much to NBC's chagrin, in a way.

Yes, yes, in multiple ways.

Yeah.

What about J. Leto?

You know who that is?

Who?

LAUGHTER The awe before the who.

It's really interesting.

Like you're trying to decide if you know what it is.

Yeah, you know, I've just moved in real slow at my age.

You know, I'm in my early to late.

Yeah.

How did you get into this line of work?

Well, for a moment, I was, for 15 minutes, I was a professor at Pepperdine University.

Really?

The Skoundrels.

Yes.

And then I got fired, as one does.

Of course.

And then I thought, you know what?

I have a whole life ahead of me.

I'm going to just start writing books.

And I was like, fiction seems hard, doing research seems hard.

So you were that sweet spot in between.

Yeah, sweet spot in between.

Where you do no research about the people you're writing about.

Scott, I got to tell you, you're the most interesting character I've ever written about.

Really?

And I've written about Mike DuCock.

What'd you write about him?

That's when you was in that tank?

Yeah.

And I wish I knew a lot about Mike DuCock.

Is there anything really?

He's a Democrat.

And he ran.

Did you write in a chapter about how he was the first person I ever voted for?

Is that true?

Oh my goodness, Scribblestgribble.

Right, right, right.

That was in the Obama election.

You wrote in DuCock?

Yeah.

In 2008, Scott Ockerman wrote in Mike DuCock.

I just even wrote Mike.

They'll know who you're talking about.

Yeah, they knew.

They knew.

Why do they let you write anyone into that?

You know what I mean?

It's like you're never going to get the person that you want in there.

So why?

But it's for spoiled brats to do that for.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah.

I believe the founding fathers knew that a well-served country would be full of people with senses of humor who could write in the funniest name of the time.

I know that because I've written most of the founding fathers biographies.

Most, why not all?

Some of them were boring.

Some of them are dead.

Well, I think all of them are dead.

Really?

Yeah.

Which ones?

You get all of them, I mean.

Yeah.

I include that.

Oh, no.

Do you name the founding fathers?

I don't know who's could say is Franklin a founding father, Ben Franklin?

Probably.

I don't know.

I mean, he definitely found that key on that kite.

That's right.

It's a little electricity.

Born in the full moon in New Hampshire.

Ben Franklin was born.

He moved to New York City with a reservation, one hand, and tap shoes and the other.

Sensing a lot of recurring motifs in the work.

Well, that's you.

That's not me.

I'm not a fan of my own work.

Yeah.

What about John Hancock?

There's a guy we don't know anything about.

Guy who's famous just for writing big.

I signed his name when I signed my checks.

Oh, really?

Mm-hmm.

No one's ever noticed.

Checks two people or the ones you're cashing.

Who?

This is a thing.

Like, why?

OK, so you signed the back of a check that's given to you.

Does anyone check that shit out or no?

No, there's just one sad guy at the bank who has to check.

Yes.

Yeah, that's my car.

I do that.

And now I'm here to talk about my crazy job at the bank, which is to check the signatures and to check the inaccuracy.

Well, I'm flattered, I have to say, that you wrote a book about me.

I don't know how I came up onto your radar.

You know?

Well, you came to me in a dream, and then I Googled you, and you were real, and I was so excited.

That's interesting.

I wonder if that's like a subconscious thing where you saw some of my work.

Yeah, maybe.

And I wondered who I was and then went to sleep.

Exactly.

Something I saw you, I walked past you on the street, it turned out you are real.

And I think that this book is just going to be flying off the shelf.

Yeah, this was not a dishelft.

Because that holds 400 books.

That's a strong shelf, first of all.

Or a long one.

It's both.

I have one shelf.

I think it's going to go fly it off the shelf, mostly, because my house gets hit by very specific earthquakes, pretty often.

But also, I think it's really specific ones.

Yeah, just really ones that are just my house.

Really?

So you're on several fault lines, wherever they intersect.

But I think people are really going to love it.

The part about you almost going to jail for murder, a murder that you didn't commit, that part, people love that.

It's exciting, yeah.

All your marriages.

It's good if people are going to love it.

How's it end?

October 3rd.

Yeah, are you sure you want to know?

Remember, I can predict death.

Yeah, with how much accuracy?

Between 0 and 100%.

Oh, yeah, this is important.

Yeah, hit me.

How am I going to die?

You die at 190 begging to die.

Yes, because it's way too long to be alive.

Yeah, I hear anything after 70.

It's all just pointless.

Yeah, I'm living that.

So just begging, who am I begging?

If you don't mind me.

Everyone, anyone, the nurse is surrounding you.

You're surviving family members.

Right.

Is assisted suicide legal by that?

No.

Man.

But you know what your last words are?

What's that?

I did it.

Oh, of course.

It's a beautiful story.

Beautiful.

Now, what do you do with this sort of fate?

Do is it an edible story where fate is always determined whether you know it or not?

Or can you change your fate, Scott Ockerman?

Edible story?

Now that you know it.

A delicious edible story.

Because we've been taking edibles this entire time.

It's hard to do a show like this without being high.

Yes, most podcasts are done.

That's the only way we can come up with the jokes.

I wish you had told me I would have put LSD in my tea.

Now I feel like an idiot.

They have some doses.

I might go to a little bit earlier.

Yeah, you want some?

Yeah.

Gulpy, gulp, gulp, gulp.

Thank you.

You take such silent gulps.

It's good for you to let us know what you're doing.

Exactly.

Right.

So how do you feel now?

Tired.

We shouldn't have put LSD in the sleepy time.

I'm a fact I heard.

Yeah.

I'm a meal.

I'm tired.

You look like that little bear.

You put the little hat on.

You've got your pajamas on.

Which bear is this?

On the sleepy time tea box.

Oh, I love that bear.

My celestial tea.

I love that bear.

It is on the Mount Rushmore of Bear mascots.

Taddington?

Yes.

He's on the Bear Mount Rushmore.

Yes.

Smoky?

Smoky.

Oh, smoky.

Not the new smoky.

The real smoky.

Yeah, yeah.

The bear that killed the movie in the vernar, killed the owner in the vernar who's on it.

Oh, yes, in grizzly life.

Grizzly man.

Yeah.

The bear that I wrote his biography.

Oh.

He did it his way.

Yeah.

The bear that I heard was the man.

You heard me.

OK.

The bear from the edge with Alec Baldwin.

Mm-hm.

Sure.

Yeah.

That creek.

Written by the, or directed by David Mamet.

Written by him, definitely.

The bear from the children's book, Corduroy?

Yeah.

OK.

And a jeers and a dishonorable mention to the charm and bear who cannot wipe his own ass to save his life.

Who does update in this collection of bears?

Who does update?

Yeah.

We're doing Dreamcast of the now-air style.

I would say, yes.

I'd be doing one more of an early-style bear, or a karaoke, or a one- I think the Coca-Cola ball of all-star.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

He's probably got a nice sort of Chevy Chase vibe to him.

I like how you said Chevy.

Chevy.

I do a soft shush.

Yeah.

I thought I was going to say Jimmy Growlin.

Who?

Do bears growl?

Like, like, growlin?

Yes.

Do bears growl?

Yes.

You know they grow.

You're the one that get a huge laugh because it wasn't the quality of the joke.

It was a misunderstanding of the noises of bears.

I thought you were trying to talk about a real person, and I said, I don't know who they're making.

They're just crawling because it's more foul-in.

No, it's not.

I think the same as Growlin.

It's the same as Growlin.

He forgot about Pooh Bear.

Oh.

Pooh Bear.

Winnie the Pooh.

The bottomless wonder.

Amy Polar Bear.

That's a bear.

That worked actually pretty well.

Well, how about if I had said that right away, and he's got off of it?

This is the story of your whole appearance.

The way I look, you mean?

Yes, and you were real ago.

Well, look, guys, we're running out of time, unfortunately.

I feel bad.

I thank you for writing this book about me.

Will you sign it?

Of course I'll sign it.

To you or?

Yeah, whatever you want to write.

Your signature is enough.

Do you mind if I just cross stuff out and correct it?

Be sure.

What are we doing?

Yeah, OK.

Oh, yeah.

Official annotated on my right foot.

Yeah, this didn't happen.

None of this.

I got your signature.

Your life is mine now.

I can do whatever I want with your life.

Wait a minute.

This was a contract?

Yeah, to write your unauthorized biography.

Oh, OK, so this is just a contract.

It's not the actual unauthorized biography.

Well, so now you're going to write the real one?

Oh, no.

I'll have to start from scratch.

Oh, dear.

That's going to be a lot of work to figure out what kind of moon he was born on.

I know I know I know it.

Well, we're running out of time.

We just have time for one final feature on the show.

That is a little something called plug.

I'm going to do a plug.

So I'm going to do a plug.

So I'm going to do one like this one now.

Oh, great.

That was teeny, tiny, pluggy, wuggies.

Shortest plugs theme that we've had in a long time.

Thank you so much.

That was Kevbot 4000.

Did that one?

Thank you so much to Kevbot 4000.

Yes.

You're whole.

You grab the mic and you're putting it right in front of your open mouth like I have something to say.

I'm trying to be polite to you.

And then I call on you and you have nothing.

I'm not aware of my own body.

I suppose.

Sometimes I want to have something to say.

And so I grab the mic.

Nothing is there.

All right.

Lloyd Garterbelts is here.

Kyle, what do you want to plug here?

Obviously we've plugged enough, I think.

Freebie.

I'd like to plug freebie.

The concept of freebie.

Whenever it may be.

And yeah, Avenue five and high school, both premiering over the next couple of weeks on your neighborhood streaming service.

And those checks are just coming in this week.

Oh my gosh.

Yeah.

You've all those for me?

Yeah.

Wow.

Amazing.

Signed by John Hancock.

Yeah, right on the back.

All right.

Matilda Graveman.

What do you want to plug?

Anything?

Real plugs?

Yeah.

Sure.

I mean, we only do real plugs.

In the plug's basket.

Well, my.

Back.

I forgot how to do the show.

My Mike Dukakis biography obviously.

Oh, good.

Yeah.

The real plug.

Yeah.

Two podcasts on Headgum.

Uh-huh.

Called Sitcom D&D, which is my new podcast.

I'm worried about this.

I hear it's good.

Yeah.

I just showed my kid Carrie.

Yes.

OK, forget it.

I'm going to try and make it look like a Hintai.

Hintai and Hintai and Hintai.

Hintai and Hintai.

Hintai and Hintai and Hintai.

I'm going to try and make it look like a Hintai and Hintai.

I love the Hintai and Top Gun Maverick.

You're going to quick turn around.

Yeah, that was Hintai Plug Mix by Glassic, I believe.

Thank you so much for that wonderful closing up the plug bag theme.

And guys, I want to thank you so much, Kyle.

Always a pleasure to have you on the show.

Thank you so much.

Continued success to you.

Me too.

I love it.

And I'm like, hey, he's here for an app.

I love it.

Kyle showed up.

Thank you very much for having me.

My pleasure.

And Matilda Graveman.

Yeah.

Wake up.

It's a sleepy time tea with LSD and it is something else.

I'll tell you that.

Who visited you in this dream to write a biography?

You.

And you're real.

Oh, dear.

And Lloyd Garderbell.

It's been real.

It's been fun.

You're either never coming back or you're here next week.

I haven't decided at this point.

All right.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.

Bye.

Here you go.

Bye.

♪♪♪♪ Okay.
