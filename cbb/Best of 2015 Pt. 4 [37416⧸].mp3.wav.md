Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. Thank you to Benicio Del Boro.

What?

For that catchphrase.

He's having fun with the name.

He's having fun, and that's what we're gonna do on this very special episode of Comedy Bang Bang.

That's right!

We count down your top three episodes of the year.

Of Comedy Bang Bangs.

Don't listen to this not of everything.

Yeah, not of anything in the world.

There's a Meet the Press in there.

So someone has watched one episode of Meet the Press that is so good.

It's better than the entirety of Game of Thrones.

It's so good at marriage inclusion in a top three countdown of episodes of anything.

Of episodes of anything.

Hot gas, television.

Oh, a weird, psychotic break that I had.

Sure.

That episode got in there.

And he's speaking of Scott, Scott, you're Scott Ockerman.

Yeah.

I'm Paul F. Tompkins.

Yeah.

I'm the host for these countdowns.

Yeah.

You're the host of Comedy Bang Bang.

Yeah.

I'm not.

No, you're not.

You're the host of Spontaneous Nation.

That's right.

I show up for these parts.

Yep.

And speaking of countdowns, not only are we counting down.

You can be my interest.

I'm an interest speaker.

And I peed.

I also peeked in the shower.

Oh, no.

Have you been...

When I wash myself, how am I supposed to wash myself?

Oh, without peeking.

So when you're in the shower, you have your hands over your eyes and you peek through their little cracks and...

Oh, look at that.

I wear glasses in the shower that I've painted eyeballs on.

Okay.

So it looks like I'm looking for him.

Looks like you're looking.

So people are like, who are passing by going, oh, he's fine in that shower.

Yeah.

He's got his eyes open, everything's fine.

My shower street level.

And it's outside of my house.

Oh, sure.

Yeah.

And it's not a shower.

It's just a hose that I put over a fence.

Sure, of course.

This is a good story.

It's a good story.

I'm learning a lot about you.

It's a great story.

Oh, my gosh.

So not only are we counting down these episodes.

Yes.

We're also counting down the hours to a new year.

We are.

Because this is New Year's Eve, is it us?

Yes, and I did want to ask you something.

Yes, sure.

Maybe it's much too early in the game.

Ah, but I thought I'd ask you just the same.

Sure.

What are you doing New Year?

New Year's Eve, jizz.

Save it.

Saves it every time.

It saves it every time.

Saves it every time.

What are you doing New Year's Eve?

Obviously, we're not taping this on New Year's Eve.

You're listening to it on New Year's Eve.

We tape this in the past.

What are you doing?

What will I be doing?

What will you be doing?

Are you, will you be awake at the stroke of midnight?

I will be.

Yeah.

My beloved and I, we often travel.

Jay Jay Jay Jay Jay, Jamison.

She hates vigilantes.

Sure.

We travel back to Los Angeles on New Year's Eve from South Carolina.

One memorable year, we rang in the new year at baggage claim at LAX.

Oh, 10.

We were standing.

Was anyone shouting that?

Here's what happened.

We were like, such a long travel day.

Was it delayed?

Was everything delayed and everything?

I think there's probably a delay.

Okay.

So people are not stoked to be there because they had hoped to get them earlier and...

No, no.

Us and a bunch of other people standing waiting for our bags.

Right.

It took a long time.

Everyone's just...

Gotcha.

I don't know why he's a gotcha, but it is somehow.

You dared to say something.

I tried to slip that back to you.

I tried to slip that common phrase, but...

I mean, you made the fuck up.

You got me again.

We were standing at our baggage claim.

Everybody's miserable.

And then we heard out on the sidewalk.

Somebody went, oh, and then we all at baggage claim looked around like you're like...

Oh, it would be so baller if you would just turn to the person next to you and get plan a big kiss on them.

Like the picture from World War II.

Yeah.

The sailor and the nurse.

Yeah, sailor and the nurse.

Sailor and the nurse.

All around the house.

Here's what they do when they try to catch a mouth.

Sailor and the nurse.

Yeah, da da da da da.

Sailor and the nurse.

Perfect.

Moving on.

Perfect.

You got guys?

Stick that in GarageBand.

Isolate it.

Put it on a loop.

Go fuck yourself.

Put it in RockBand.

Play along with it.

Oh my God.

See if you can win.

Oh, it's good now.

It's good now.

It's smart that we take these all in one day.

You know what?

It's good now.

It's good.

It's good now that we do this.

It's like a Twilight Zone.

The cornfield.

It's good.

It's real good.

It's right for Red Hour.

It's real good.

Look him up from old school.

Look him up, everybody.

We're in old school.

Zoolander 2.

Out soon.

What are we doing?

We're counting down your top three.

Who are we?

Okay, let's start at the beginning.

The Big Bang.

There it is.

We have the...

What you guys do for Comedy Bang Bang, this is your first time listening.

What are you doing?

This is insane.

So what?

Oh, Scott.

So what I probably said.

You know what?

I'm going to listen to best of number four.

If you're going to be my girlfriend, you've got to get into this comedy podcast I like so much.

Boy, that is the recipe for disaster.

Indeed.

And we are the cooks.

Yes.

Sugar to taste.

Um...

A dirt Francis mystery.

A horse has been killed and cooked.

I hate to dig Francis or dirt Francis.

A lot of horse mysteries.

I think more horse mysteries than actually occur in the world.

Do you think the detective in this series of books, like when the phone call comes and he's like, another horse?

You've got to be good.

I mean, after the first one I figured I retired.

Okay.

Every fucking one.

Because I used to work in a bookstore.

Every one of those fucking books has a horse and a job.

Yeah.

How does a guy go?

You know what?

I'm going to write a bunch of horse mysteries.

Is the detective a jockey?

I just, I don't know.

I've never read one.

Is there a well?

Are the horse, do they talk?

Is the horse the detective?

Wait a minute.

What are you trying to tell me?

Is he the murderer?

Give him some peanut butter.

Maybe I'll make him talk.

Oh my God.

Is it darker?

I bet it's dick.

I think it's dick Francis.

Let me look at him.

Ah, look for time.

Up, horse and then dick and see what comes up.

Oh, good idea.

Oh no.

Jeez.

Jeez music.

So we're counting down, people vote on their favorite comedy bang bang episodes of the year.

We count them down.

This is the top three.

These are the best of the year.

And you know, a lot of, a lot through the year, through the year.

Oh yeah.

I've never let you down.

I never let you down.

You fucking let down bitch.

Oh, you let yourself down.

I'm not the one who did it.

Go make my pizza.

Because you get dick Francis on the case.

Dick Francis, by the way.

It is.

Wow.

And is he yours?

Did you find that out?

Okay.

Look it up.

Let me just ask.

Look it up, Polly.

Look it up.

I'm going to ask Google.

Look it up.

Polly, look it up, Polly.

Look it up.

Look it up, Polly.

Look it up.

Look it up, Polly.

Look it up.

Okay.

Here we go.

Ask Siri.

Here we go.

Siri is dick Francis a horse.

Oh, good news.

It just says yes.

Yes.

Oh, it was a question.

Hold on.

Here we go.

Come on.

Siri, come on.

Let me down.

Don't embarrass me in front of everyone.

How can I help you?

Is Dick Francis a horse?

Checking.

Oh.

Here's what I found on the web.

Well the first thing is Wikipedia.

Okay.

So presumably that will tell us whether or not.

If Dick Francis is a horse.

Dick Francis obituary.

Oh, oh.

Sorry, Dicky boy.

You did.

You did horse.

Glue factory for Dicky boy.

Oh, there's a picture of a man and a horse.

I don't know when to do Dick Francis.

Oh, well, we don't know.

We'll never know.

Dick Francis lost that race.

We shot him in the way.

Let's just assume he's a horse.

Mm hmm.

Okay.

The court stipulates Dick Francis is a horse.

And blowing nose and blowing nose.

Blowing nose and blowing nose.

Oh, very good.

All right.

Why don't we get to it?

What do you say?

Yeah, man.

Let's do it.

This is your episode number three.

Number three.

All right.

Here we go.

This is the third most popular comedy bang bang episode of the year.

And this is episode 355.

Scott, can I stop you right there?

Yes, please.

This has been a year of many, many good episodes.

Many good episodes.

This is maybe the best year of comedy bang bang yet.

Some people say that and I appreciate it.

I, you know, I've been working hard on it, but they're only as good as they can be when you do them.

They're all improv, so you never know.

Well, you took the fun out of that.

Go ahead.

Dope.

No, it's been great.

I mean, there's so many.

I think this is the best year.

I really do.

So many great people have dropped by this year and so many good classic episodes, I think, and these three are among them definitely.

But this is number three.

This is from June 8.

This is an episode entitled Kid Detectives.

Kid Detectives.

Now, what this is is Thomas Middleditch, of course, you heard him earlier, immediate fan favorite.

Immediate.

From the moment it was released, it was bestowed upon him.

Fan favorite you are.

I remember it was released and the fans got together and they said, we got to put out a press release.

Here we go.

Attention.

To all people who listen to that thing.

What are they talking to?

Mr. Microphone.

Well, Mr. Microphone, let's go back to pick you up later.

We'll be back to pick you up later.

The two people who can hear me.

Maybe my favorite reference of all time.

Oh my God.

No one would ever, it's the most, we've talked about, I think we talked about last year on the best O's.

The most disappointing gift to get.

The most misleading commercial I think I've ever seen.

Yeah.

A Mr. Microphone was, according to the commercial, if you had it, you could walk by someone's radio and talk into the microphone and your voice would come out of their radio.

And so it's like a guy had a Mr. Microphone and two good looking women are driving like in a Jeep and open face Jeep.

Open face Jeep.

Excuse me, may I order an open face Jeep?

Do you remember that episode of Mash?

We're clinging right to Jeep?

Oh yes I do.

Open face.

Open face, of course.

But two women in a Jeep are driving by and a guy speaks into his microphone and goes, hey good looking, they all look around like what is this?

And then he's like I'll be back to pick you up later.

Or maybe he was in the car.

He was in the car.

Okay sure.

But whatever.

But anyway, the point of this all is you then order the Mr.

Microphone and I ordered one.

Did you have one?

No I did not.

Okay you order it.

I coveted it for sure.

You order it and what do you find out?

But it will only be picked up on radios that are tuned to a certain station and that certain station is in the lower frequencies in like the 87s or 86s or whatever where no one would ever tune their radio to.

So it's like fun if you tune your own radio to it.

Then you have a little loud speaker.

Then you have a loud speaker.

The end.

You want to put it in another room.

Like if you're a kid you think when you're a kid.

Right.

I'll tune the radio to the style.

I'll put it in the other room.

And then I'll pretend like I'm in a news announcer like.

Right.

Aliens have landed.

Or I'll make fart sounds when someone sits down like.

Or that.

But that's the only difference in our childhood.

That's the only fun to be had with this thing.

Yeah.

You can't do that.

Hey good looking.

I'll be back to picking up later.

What about the guy who is dancing down the street singing jingle bells.

Ah this mother fucker.

Holy is radio.

It's like we need to sing a song.

It's got to be the public domain though.

Yeah what do we got?

How about jingle bells?

How about this melody?

Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

Wait not any other note.

Just the one.

Okay yeah I'll do it.

I blame the actor in the commercial too.

I blame all of them.

Sure.

They should not have agreed to be in it.

They're all.

None of them are all complicit.

They're all complicit.

I don't want to hear I was just following orders.

Can I tell you another misleading one?

For me it's a job more misleading than the Mr. Microphone.

Okay.

There was a toy called Big Track.

Big Track.

It was like a futuristic tank kind of thing.

And it was battery power and the idea was it had a keypad that you could program it to do different moves and stuff.

Okay.

So you could program a sort of course for it to follow.

Okay.

And on the commercial the kid is playing with it and he like boop boop boop boop boop boop presses on the keypad and then Big Track like goes around.

It starts to go down like it looks like it's going to go down some stairs but then it like whoop backs up turns around goes the other way.

Back up turns around.

It was the other way.

That's right.

You remember the song?

Of course.

Like at one point it goes by the family cat and then it turns and shoots a laser at the cat.

Which was just like a little light flashed and then there was but a great noise like boop boop boop.

And the cat like jumped out of the way.

I think the cat just sat there.

But then like a cat when you actually got the toy which I did and I was thrilled to the gills to get this thing.

Oh my goodness.

There's you can't figure it takes so much trial error to figure out the distance.

Oh you have to pre program everything.

Yeah you pre program everything.

Oh man.

Meanwhile your cat is sitting there going well come on.

I'm waiting for my scene.

Get back.

Jump back.

Turn the other way.

That's what I call the picture.

Oh we're losing our minds.

We really are.

Okay.

Did we do it yet?

We're going to get to it.

So it's number three.

Number three this is kid detective.

So Thomas was people kept asking me get get Thomas back.

Wait a minute.

He came back.

Paul have Tom gets on too much.

No.

Paul have Tom gets on more they say.

Oh that didn't happen.

I think what the situation of this was Thomas and Lauren were at a show at an improv show and they started improving these characters for like five minutes.

And then I think it was Thomas called me up and said me and Lauren want to do a show together.

And I was like oh okay what do you want to do and he told me what they were.

So these guys are on as themselves because they had the Silicon Valley season finale was on that week and Lauren was in Jurassic World that week.

Oh that's right.

So they were on as themselves which was which was rare strange for Lauren to do but that was really funny.

And then the next segment we came back and here are the characters they're doing.

The kid detectives this is your number three.

Number three.

These are a couple of interesting young children who have their own business we'll talk about.

I want to welcome JJ and Murphy O'Malleyman.

Hey.

Are you saying hey to each other or.

Oh yeah we haven't seen each other in a while.

Oh hey.

Hey.

Yeah we haven't seen each other in like I don't know 20 minutes.

Turn your focus to me and say hey to me what do you say.

Hey.

Okay.

Yeah when an adult says hello or introduces you it's customary to bow.

No no you don't have to bow.

Please stop that please.

You're doing like a Japanese half bow.

Please stop that.

I recently learned that.

Yeah from the Japanese.

Uh huh.

Yeah.

Now you got you kids how old are you guys.

Well I'm 10.

You could say I'm eight.

Okay I will say it because it's the truth or are you.

No you could say it but I'm really 11.

We're having fun.

That's a lot of fun.

So we like to have fun.

How what was the distance in between your birth was it nine months or was it a year and a half or.

Yeah it was about nine months my parents they did it once they had me and then they did it again and had him yuck.

So what's your remember.

Yeah I remember them doing it.

Murphy what's your birthday.

It's September 6th.

And so JJ that would make yours then.

9 11.

Okay that makes sense.

Alright so now you guys have an interesting business I know.

And it's.

You could say that.

Yeah.

Wait so do you or don't you.

You do.

Well we think it's pretty normal but I understand that not a lot of kids do it.

Yeah well not a lot of kids have businesses nor are they entrepreneurs.

Yeah I guess that's true.

We've been trying to get this business off the ground for a while but it's really working out now.

Yeah it's really humming.

So you guys have gotten it off the ground.

Yeah it's fine.

Yeah are you incorporated or what do you have an LLC or.

I don't know.

How do you answer that.

Just cash under the table.

Grow up questions.

Make me nervous.

Look we just get money from the people.

Do you accept Traveler's Jack's Diners Club.

Just dollars and cents sir please.

Dollars and cents okay.

Yeah.

Look pal it's just a detective agency that's it.

Okay we're kid detectives.

You're kid detectives.

Yes.

Sometimes making people do time.

Yeah you're putting people in jail.

Yup.

Meaning your testimony you're not a do you do perform citizens arrests or.

We'll lock them up in the slammer.

We built our own jail in my dad's basement.

What.

Yeah it's cool.

Okay I don't know that it's cool.

How many convicts do you have?

We got three rotting right now.

Yeah.

Serving their time.

Everyone is rotting technically.

Oh yes so.

Wow what a creep.

From the moment you're born your body starts decaying and dying.

Hey this guy's making me nervous.

So well that's adorable.

So I mean other than the locking people up I believe you're depriving them of their constitutional rights by locking them into or are the police aware of this.

No the cops don't know.

Do you know those are uniforms?

Yeah we don't have any uniforms.

We're in street clothes.

Cities.

Wait what did you say do you notice our uniforms and then you of course said.

Of course we don't have any.

Right.

So I said did you notice them I think.

Did you know how could you.

They're non-existent.

Yeah of course.

Very good.

So if you were there uniforms are shorts and t-shirts.

Just kid clothes buddy.

Okay.

Yeah.

So how did you get interested in this?

I mean this is an interesting occupation for a young child to be.

I mean a lot of kids they're out there on the playground or they're like hey I love my dolly I like my Barbies.

Well we'll tell you.

One night a couple of our friends dared us to go an old man with his old abandoned house.

That's creepy.

Yeah and we said I don't know that looks as scary.

Now is that a direct quote.

Yeah.

That's why you were stuttering like that is that's exactly what you said.

Your knees were knocking sir.

Oh okay certainly.

Thank you for that modicum of respect directed at me.

Yeah.

So they dared us to spend one night in there and we did it and there was a ghost and we found out that all it was wanting was just to know that people really remembered it.

Okay.

Alright so a real ghost.

Yeah.

Are you guys nervous right now?

Yeah.

Just talking about it.

This is a scare just thinking about the ghost.

Yeah.

Well we had our notepad and our flashlight and a bunch of marshmallows and our backwards hats.

Okay so did the marshmallows come into play ever?

We ate them for sustenance.

Yeah you picked them toy toy.

Okay I thought maybe you used it to catch the active plant.

Okay.

But what?

Sorry guys sorry guys.

So who is this guy?

Now I don't know that this is detection work as much as going into a house and just seeing a ghost.

Well we haven't told you about our current crime.

Did you guys hear that by the way there was like a door squeak?

That doesn't mean you stop at my words.

Yeah stop writing in my words.

Stop writing in my words.

Yeah because you said your current crime but you must have meant current crime stopping.

Yeah we're on a case right now.

Yes case.

What is the case you're on right now?

Well somewhere in the city of Los Angeles there's a guy who's skinning women alive.

And we're skinning women alive?

Yeah and we've come across a couple of skinned bodies still sort of in their last moments of life.

They've been flayed.

Yeah.

And we're taking it upon ourselves to figure out who did it.

Yeah.

How did you come across these bodies?

I mean one is weird enough but you've come across more than what?

Well the first one was our mom.

Yeah and we sure do miss her.

But don't worry we put her out of her misery real quick.

Well put a bunch of salt on her.

Yeah.

Wait a minute that is not putting.

She shrunk up like a slug.

That's not putting someone out of their misery that's lengthening their pain.

To put her out of you know I would have grabbed a brick or something and bashed her in the head or something like that.

Hey that's her mom.

Okay that's her.

Should her out of like a salt lick.

Yeah.

So this was the first case.

This was the first instance of this happening.

Yeah.

And then you know well we wandered around town kind of sad kind of missing our mom.

Yeah our dad wasn't around.

Ever since sad him he's been on the lamb.

Yeah we wonder who did it to our mommy.

And so we went out searching and we found other ladies from her book club who were all flayed and dead.

Yeah other ladies from her book club.

Yeah.

Okay what we think has something to do with the book they were reading.

Yeah what book were they reading?

A Tale of Two Cities.

Did you hear that?

Is that that ghost again?

Oh man.

Go.

So they were reading a Tale of Two Cities.

They were reading a Tale of Two Cities by Dickens.

No.

An updated version.

By JK Rowling.

Okay.

And is are all of the women you went around to the women in this book club.

Why did you go to the first one by the way?

Well we wanted to see if maybe they knew who killed our mom.

Yeah.

These are her closest friends.

Yeah.

Nancy who's the first woman we stopped at.

She was always really nice.

She took us in when we were running away from our dad sometimes.

Oh okay.

Okay.

Sometimes our dad would chase us with a knife and say he was going to skin us.

Oh okay well that's interesting.

But moving on to the case.

What Nancy is the first woman you drop by and she, where was she?

Describe the scene.

Well we opened the door and then we went through the hallway and then we went to the kitchen which was covered in blood and the skins.

And she had us his cupcakes.

Yummy.

Cool so we had a bit of a cupcake right there and then our mom never let us have those when she was alive.

Yes we split one and two and then each had a half.

We don't want to overdo it.

So you had a quarter of a cupcake.

No I said half.

Oh I thought you meant you split one and two and then each had a half of that half.

I had an eighth of an eighth.

The math is getting very complicated for me right now.

Alright so you haven't seen the body at this point.

No sir.

And we went upstairs to her room and we went in her bathroom and she was in her tub.

Yeah.

Any water in the tub?

Or I would imagine there's a lot of blood.

Just blood.

Yeah just a whole lot of blood.

In your face.

With no skin and no nose.

How did you recognize her?

How did you know it was Nancy?

She was holding the buck.

Yeah and she was still alive.

Oh and she said my name is Nancy in case you don't recognize me?

Yeah.

Hey it sounds like you were there.

Oh no.

I mean I certainly- I'll buy for that.

I'm aware the heck were you that night.

Well I have an alibi for May 31st of course.

How'd you know what day it was?

What?

Okay Murph.

Good cut, bad cut.

Okay take notes.

Alright Mr.

Want a snack?

Yeah.

Uh yeah I would love a snack.

I mean do you have any kind of like dry peanuts?

Uh sure.

I'll get some from 7-11.

You'll be bad.

Now listen up bozo.

Hey.

Where is that?

The red nose because all my capillaries in it have burst because of my drinking.

Oh.

Doesn't that you can call me bozo?

I don't suppose you were drinking on the night of June 619.

I'm back.

What dinner are you talking about?

I'm talking about the deade invasions again.

She said it was May 31st.

Oh sorry.

What were you doing on May 31st?

Tilling a- I mean I was sitting around at home by myself not calling anyone on the telephone.

Oh he was gonna say killing time.

Oh.

Well let me see your wallet.

Oh certainly here you go.

Mm hmm.

Two dollars.

Eight dollars.

Twelve dollars.

A hundred dollars.

One hundred twelve dollars.

One plus one plus two.

That's four.

Four Washington Lane.

The next clue is in the White House.

Let's go.

We're watching Dislaine.

You guys are gonna be lost.

What are you talking about?

No no you uh that's not where we're going to know where the- Lost the show.

Uh John Locke.

L-O-S-T.

Four letters.

Four Washington Lane.

The next clue is at the White House.

Let's go.

Guys it sounds like you just want to go to the White House and you don't know where it is.

It is.

Four letters.

Four Washington Lane.

The White House.

Okay.

The next clue is at the White House.

We have to go.

What are we doing when we're wasting time?

Let me give you a tip.

Sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue.

That's where you want to go.

So you know the location we have to go to for the next clue.

I don't think there's any clues at this White House.

I think we were right.

The clue is at the White House all along.

Yeah.

Okay.

Don't know you.

Just because you stressed something doesn't mean that it makes sense.

It sounds like the clue is at the White House this whole time.

Okay no guys.

Wait there's a White-We live in White House.

Mom?

Dad?

Who killed Mom?

Okay guys what?

Looking through my notes.

Pictures.

Drawings of Mom.

She's dead.

Who did it?

Okay.

You-Can't-Can't-I'm not.

Can I say something about your deductive reasoning skills?

If you gotta.

Jeez.

I don't know that you're that good at this.

Okay.

Hey we solved a bunch of cases.

What are we?

Who are the three guys in the basement?

Well once our principal.

Okay by the way are these guys that your dad just chased around with a knife and locked up in the basement?

No our principal was really mean.

So we locked him up to teach him a lesson.

Yeah and he was also spying on kids.

What crime is he-He was spying on kids?

The potholes in the bathroom wall.

Yeah.

And he put his eyes behind the halls.

Yeah and then when he was getting ready he shoved his wiener in there.

At what point was he good and ready?

When he said, I'm good and ready.

Here comes the wiener.

He's saying the dreidel song.

He said.

And when it's good and ready I'll shove it through the wall.

He said, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay.

And when it's good and ready I'll shove it through the wall.

Okay.

It's a strange catch race for this guy.

But yeah well that's what Mr. Salberg gets.

But you need to know what his penis looks like.

Oh yeah.

A dreidel.

Yeah.

He was playing thin coming out and then got really wide and then pointing at the bottom.

Yeah and it had all those symbols on it.

Oh okay.

Like none.

Yeah he was a diabic.

Okay.

So this was the first guy that you put away.

Yeah.

You could say that.

Okay is it true?

Yeah.

Yeah well the first guy we tried to put away he ran.

So he shot him.

Oh boy.

What was his crime?

Running away.

Yeah.

Was it sort of a stand to your ground lock situation?

Look.

When two kids of the law come up to you and started asking questions?

Don't run away.

That just makes you look guilty.

Okay.

What were you asking questions about?

Well where's the nearest peanut store?

And like how do you, what do you do if you wet your pants but you don't have new ones?

Yeah and how can you cry as quiet as again?

And like what do you do if you're dead?

Come smack you in the head.

Yeah and if you've shaved half your head by accident how long will it take for the rest of it to grow back?

And if you have a scrape of your back from being whipped what does that mean?

Yeah and how long would it take to peel off all your fingernails and it will hurt?

And then he ran away.

And then he ran away from you two weird creepy kids and then you brought out a gun and shot him in the back?

Yeah.

We're not creepy.

We're detectives.

Yeah.

We keep the creeps off the streets.

I see.

But we do pack heat.

Oh okay.

Yeah we shot him with a potato gun.

Oh okay.

Okay well that's not that bad right?

It broke his skull.

Oh and lodged into his brain?

Yeah and he's allergic to potatoes.

Oh okay.

Which we knew.

Okay so this is premeditated.

Yeah.

Oh my gosh.

We're not clucking around.

Alright so you, so that was the first guy and then you moved on to your principal and then there were a couple others and then.

Yeah.

Also we solved the crime of who stole the treasury from the student body at our school.

Oh who's this?

Well it turned out to be class president Janine Garafolo.

Janine Garafolo?

Yeah.

We let her become a famous stand up comedian.

Yeah.

Wait so she was she sort of like you know how they gave Dr.

William H. Cosby an honorary doctorate.

Was she honorary class president of your because she was so famous?

Yeah.

So you're in elementary school?

No.

We're not in high school.

We're in elementary.

Well that's right you're in elementary school.

Yeah you think I'm doing going?

Well I mean yeah okay.

Oh I'm Scott Augman.

I'm a pig.

Hey come on.

Come on.

I'm a pig.

I just want to eat popcorn and gold.

Okay.

Okay you know what I don't really appreciate that kind of characterization of me.

You know I mean.

Let me roll around the mud.

Okay.

That was real.

That was really good.

Yeah.

Alright.

We've seen you.

What?

We've seen you roll around the mud.

She's 11.

Okay.

Kids got to get it on.

All right.

Guys.

There's one thing we know.

Kids got to get it on.

After you poured salt on your mother, you guys didn't do any like weird stuff over the body.

Right?

I mean, not weird unless you think it's weird to ride or like a pony with my brother's arms around my waist.

Okay.

I don't know where that falls on the weird spot.

It falls on the weird spectrum.

I'm not really sure.

I've never imagined it.

I was just holding on.

It's sometimes the ride gets real bumpy.

So I got to grab a breast.

Okay.

It's cool.

All right.

Number three.

Oh, so good.

So good.

We didn't even get to the special mind control powers that Thomas has carried her at where he says he broke a dog once.

That's coming up in that.

So go back and listen to that complete thing.

It's very, very funny.

And so many people constantly tweeting to me, Lauren and Thomas about for Washington Lane.

Oh, me too, by the way.

Okay.

I wasn't even in.

I had nothing to do with it.

But I feel like anything I've ever tweeted that had the number four in it.

Yeah.

It gets stuck in someone's mind.

We did that for Washington Lane.

The next clue is in the White House.

So good.

All right.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, we'll have your top two episodes of the year.

We'll be right back.

Are you listening to the words coming out of my mouth?

Hands it.

It's going to fucking easy.

Comedy bang bang.

We're back here with Paul left.

Tom K.

Hey, that's me.

You're Scott Ockerman.

I am.

I recognize you from the money.

From the money?

You're on money.

Yeah.

I decided.

That's what all the money I get from your wolf.

Yeah.

That made not be valid.

Get your wolf bucks.

Yeah.

Your wolf bucks.

They're only valid here in the year.

They're not as bad as the way they're being.

I think it was five or six days before.

Two or three days later, I saw him at a wedding.

We talked about what we talked about.

You can listen to this episode and hear the intro for it.

But also one thing that he was trying to get me to do was bring his character back on the TV show as a regular.

As a regular.

Yes.

He wanted to be on the show every episode.

I kind of wish I had, honestly.

He was really making a hard sell for that while we were at this wedding.

Was he serious?

He's like, I don't know if the guy can come back.

I'm trying to do him, but I can't really do him.

It's a little Cosby.

You know, I can go back.

Ben Carson with the pyramids.

I can open up the greens.

Look at your brain.

I love brains.

I want to open up as many as goals as possible.

Don't you know?

Anyway, so, yeah, we recorded this five days before a hair is passed away.

If you're new to the show and you don't know, the whole history of it, hair is so great.

The only thing about the show is the story of it.

Hair is so great.

He was not only on this show a lot, but he and I had a separate podcast, The Analyze Fish Podcast that we did, but very few episodes.

You're part of The Analyze Fish family.

That's the extended Analyze Fish family.

But I feel like we only did six episodes maybe, and you did two as part of you were analyzing the movie Jaws.

Yes.

Analyze Fish.

Yes.

And he and I were analyzing the bandfish.

That's right.

One of the strangest podcasts, Switaroos.

Some people, not happy about it.

Nope, but in the story of the history of podcasts, Switaroos, that was one of the strangest.

He was also on You Talking You Two to me.

A couple episodes of that and a very funny dude and who, you know, when we've seen it since he passed away 10 months ago now, we've seen how his influence has kind of extended from Parks and Recreation to Humblebrag to his standup to these podcasts.

And so, you know, we talk about it in the episode.

I didn't know whether to release this or not because it was so fresh and so clean.

Where's that drop?

But I'm glad that we did.

And I honestly am because, and I talk about this a little bit in the episode when we had a get together in my house where a lot of his friends came over to our place to talk about him right after it happened.

A lot of people were saying how they had been listening to his podcast episodes just to, you know, hear his voice again, hear his sense of humor.

Everyone was quoting all of his Harris' phone corners.

So, you know, I'm glad I put it out.

You should be.

You know, I'm glad you put it out too.

And I think it really was, I think it was helpful for those of us that knew Harris.

And I didn't know him as well as you did, but Harris was a guy who, in my life, was somebody that I was always happy to see, that every time I saw him, he was just a positive force, you know what I mean?

I always had great conversations with him, and it was like a little bit of joking around, but we could have real conversations.

Yeah, he was a real guy.

Yeah, he really was.

And he liked, he really liked to engage with people on a human level.

I would always go pick up, he would dog sit rocky several times, and I would always go pick him up, and I would always leave like an hour and a half in that, so I could just kind of like sit down with him and chat with him.

Yeah.

He was a really good and sweet guy, and so in addition to helping those of us that knew Harris, and it was great to hear that, and it really was helpful to hear that.

I think that it helped a lot of people who were fans of the show who only knew Harris through his work.

Well, it would be weird if he just disappeared too.

Yeah, absolutely.

It was kind of like we had this one in the chamber, so why not put it out?

Yeah, and I also think for a lot of younger people who are comedy fans who maybe haven't experienced this kind of loss in their life, that it was helpful to kind of hear this after that happened.

I don't know, just to ease the pain a little bit.

Well, I'm glad people liked it, I'm glad people voted for it.

And when I put it out, I was kind of like, do I even put it in the voting?

I almost feel like it's like to vote on it is, but at the same time, who cares?

It's not number one, it shouldn't even be number one.

It's like to sympathy voted is not the right thing to do, but it is super, super funny.

And I'm going to play the first segment from it, not in its entirety, but quite a bit of it.

And this is, of course, Harris Whittles, as well as Adam Scott and Chelsea Paredi.

And Chelsea's, I was listening to it last night, Chelsea's in a great mood and so funny.

And Adam, of course, is great.

And we're just having a really, really good time.

So this is not Farts in Pro creation for the final one in the quadrilogy.

And here it is, this is your number two.

Number two.

Let me introduce you collectively, the Farts in Pro crew is here.

Hello, guys.

Welcome to the show.

It's been too long.

It took four years to schedule this.

Yeah, we've been trying to schedule this fourth one since the first one.

Has it really been, how long has it been since the last one?

Who cares?

I'm not a fucking historian.

Whoa.

I am.

You definitely were not in the calendar year of last year.

I think it was the summer of the year previous, 2013.

So we're going on two years.

Yeah.

That's so far.

You know what you did?

That's something.

So wait, I know what you did.

That's not.

I know you did that.

But what did you do last summer?

Should we just talk about what we all did last summer?

Sure, why not?

I don't remember anything.

I put on a spooky mask.

I killed a bunch of teenagers.

The air conditioning ended right as there was a pause.

It just took the, literally took the air out of the room, man.

Guys, what is happening?

First of all, you're all here.

How do you feel about Parks and Rec ending?

I mean, Adam, no one knew who you were before then.

You had tiny little pop-up roles in Veronica Mars.

And you know, of course you were in Save Point.

You were in Save Point.

Wasn't saved by the bell.

What were you in?

What?

You played Mr. Building.

Yeah.

So.

That was pretty well known.

Thank you, Chelsea.

And you used to get like a handy every week on Tell Me You Love Me.

That's right.

You were Jackay.

That's right.

I broke Jay off on 2-2-7.

Jackaying.

That's deep.

And so this was a career milestone for you.

And then, Harris and Chelsea, I mean, you were both, you know, writers of note, perhaps, in tiny year projects.

But this has made your careers.

How do you feel about the end of this program?

Adam is crying.

Adam.

Adam, what's going on?

Where are you?

I mean...

I hope those are tears of joy.

Well, it's hard.

What is...

Oh my God.

My penis.

Ah!

Why are you crying?

Why are you crying about this?

It hurts.

Has been more hours or more?

It makes me so happy.

So there's tears of joy.

It's hard.

Okay.

All right.

How seldom do you get a hard penis that...

You cry.

Every 20 minutes.

You get a hard one every 20 minutes and you cry every 20 minutes?

Is this a year round or just during pilot season?

Well, for me, 20 minutes is two weeks.

Oh my God.

Oh, well, times a flat circle.

Oh my God.

That's true, yeah.

I think I left my...

Oh no.

What's going on?

Chelsea has not stopped taking things out of bags.

She has two bags.

First of all, she has a bag inside her bag.

She took that out.

Then she has a sunglasses bag inside that bag.

She took that.

Can you play that Ericka Badu bag, ladies song now?

Yeah.

She took it out.

Speaking of bag inside a bag, there was that baby that was born with a baby in Ericka Belly.

What?

In China, it was the 200th reported case of it.

Really?

So somewhat...

Out of control.

Yeah.

That's like babies having babies literally.

Totally.

Yeah.

Total jinx.

God, what did the doctor probably didn't know whether to slap it on the fanny or congratulate.

Or abort.

Or give it abort.

So, or slap it on the fanny, then give it an abortion.

Yeah.

And how small that coat hanger is.

That's not how they do it at a hospital.

Was that...

Was the baby inside the baby?

Was the tiny, tiny baby?

Was that one dead?

That one...

The baby inside?

No.

Actually, she just graduated magna cum laude.

Wow.

They're gonna abort it with a Barbie coat hanger.

I like this.

I like this line of thinking.

This is good.

Good.

This is a rich mind.

Stay in this.

How do you feel, guys?

The show's ending tomorrow.

Empty.

Uh, I'm...

It's sad, but it's also happy because it's still good.

What's still good?

The show.

Oh, you think so?

So, tell C-Lift.

I don't know.

How do you feel, Harris?

I'm sad, but happy that everyone's enjoying it.

Yeah.

He took the words right out of my head.

No, the reluctance.

Why can't you guys just for one say, look?

It's sad.

I haven't learned how to connect with my emotions.

Look, it's sadder when things are canceled prematurely.

I feel like this is like when an old person dies.

You're like, well, they had a good life.

Like, parks, I feel like they had such a full- Yeah, it was canceled at the right time.

Yeah, it wasn't canceled.

It wasn't canceled.

I mean, technically it wasn't.

They didn't want any more episodes.

They chose.

We chose to walk away on top.

Oh, Harris is crying now.

You didn't choose anything.

Harris is crying now.

Oh man, this is unrelated again.

I'm crying.

You're telling me that if they came to you guys to, you know, Mike Schur and said, hey, you know what, we actually want more than 13.

We want 22.

No.

And we want another season.

That happened.

They were like, we want four more seasons.

Bullshit.

And Mike said, nope, walking away.

Bull fucking shit.

And I was in the room.

It was me, Mike, Les Moonves.

He's not even on NBC.

He just wanted to be there.

And I was like, do you see, like, a lot to the Watcher?

He's there for important events.

Exactly.

And I said, Mike, we can't walk away.

We got stories left to tell.

Harris and questioned writer.

Yeah.

And then Les was like, dollars, baby.

Come on.

I want those dollars, baby.

Buku Delores.

And, and I, you know, I killed, I killed him.

So what really happened?

You were playing guitar.

Who do you kill?

Les Moonves.

He's dead.

How does, how does Julie feel about this?

I don't know who that is.

Julie Chen.

Oh, yeah.

She's a parking spot.

Where?

She does.

At Radford.

I will straight sit at that parking spot.

So does Les Moonves.

He does.

At CBS Radford?

Oh, because of CBS.

Yeah.

Well, that's fantastic.

No, CBS.

The, the, the CBS on Radford Street.

No, it's the studio.

It's the studio.

A pharmacy.

You know, CBS pharmacy.

They have on on at Laurel Canyon.

This is going to be good.

And Ventura.

There are two CVS's right across the street from each other.

Yeah, yeah.

Bananas.

But I think, yeah.

Well, it's cool because if one CVS doesn't have your, I don't know what fucking tampons Jesus, then you go across the street and you buy your what fucking maxi pads.

Or you keep getting an embarrassing disease over and over and you have to get your pills.

You come back and forth.

So they think you have the clap only once or twice a year instead of like every three months.

Is the clap still clap is still a thing?

Measles.

No, measles is the new thing.

But, you know, gonorrhea is still a problem guys.

Are you guys anti-vaxxers?

I don't know how I feel.

I, I assume it's good to get vaccinated just because all the measles photos I saw.

You were real hot button issue.

Isn't that what's, let's go to hot topic.

I'm not touching that with a 10 foot pole.

Why Harris, you love controversy.

Oh, not this.

This is too rich.

Uh huh.

Harris is controversial on everything else, but now he's suddenly death mute and dumb.

That's controversial.

You know, like, don't forget that.

You're being ablest.

I learned that from Tumblr.

Yeah.

So anyway, the show, the show's gone.

Good riddance.

You guys are fine with it.

Hirsch.

Oh.

Yeah, you know what?

It's something unpredictable.

Good in the end is right.

Do you guys play that in the final episode?

We just air that music video, the full 21 minute slowed down.

Mm hmm.

Although it's an hour.

You're right.

It's an hour.

You guys have an hour finale.

What do we have planned on the finale?

By the way, by the time this airs, there will be a, a very special guest will have made an appearance.

Meaning on last week's episode?

Yeah.

Do you know what I'm talking about?

You guys can just say it.

If it's what I think, then you were not really able to do this.

Genuine was already on.

Yeah, you're right.

You guys can just say it because it aired last week.

All right.

We'll say it.

Nick, offer me.

Yeah.

Where are you guys being so cagey?

Because it's not, you're not privy, bro.

Oh, shit.

You haven't been fucking privy.

It happened last week.

Yeah, I know.

But I think privy.

I, I think, I know that we can even, okay, it's plenty.

Happy with it.

Whoa!

Lady Paris.

New there.

Oh, baby.

And Katy Perry.

And left shark.

Yeah.

Oh my gosh.

Left shark.

Do you don't know about this meme?

No.

Oh, dude.

What's that?

Can we stop the show?

Yep.

Here we go.

Click.

All right.

What do you got here?

Left shark was a Katy Perry's backup dancer at the Super Bowl.

Oh, right.

Right.

And he was doing crazy stuff.

Like dancing all weird.

So what happened?

Well, left shark.

It turned out that was a serial convicted serial pedophile.

No.

No, that's not what happened at all.

But you mentioned.

I got in here.

You mentioned serial and I got excited because that's my favorite podcast.

Oh, that had an offended podcast.

You know what?

That got me so addicted to podcasts.

Podcast.

What's your favorite serial pedophile?

Mine's Jim.

It's his phone corner.

By the way, let's hear the phone corner theme.

Here we go.

Oh, fuck.

Hey, this is fun.

Let's do it.

Come on.

Hey, I'm just this phone corner.

What?

Yo, come on.

Hey, I'm just this phone on the phone.

You're the phone.

It's a phone corner.

That, of course, is the phone corner theme by Reggie Watts, who is concluding his run on Comedy Banging.

It was announced last week who's replacing him, Kid Cuddy.

We're very excited about that.

That's exciting.

Wow.

He's got so much.

Thanks for all your tweets about that.

He's got so much excitement about the new gig and a lot of enthusiasm.

I'm looking forward to him being on the show.

Harris, you got some foam?

Yeah.

So, okay.

You know.

Oh, boy.

You know.

You know when the...

Stick the big house.

You know how like...

Oh, boy.

You know how there's like candy and...

Is this Harris's meltdown corner?

I think there's the candy and like mince and bathroom sometimes.

Yeah.

I know that.

Well, that's like...

That's the last place I want my like open food is around all this shit.

Where do they have open mince in a bathroom?

They...

Like, in fancy...

We're the fancier the place, the more open mince are, they are.

No.

Yeah, just like...

But they're usually in wrappers.

I'm gonna give a fuck.

You can wrap it in a fucking...

In...

Jacket.

Art.

That's not enough.

Yeah.

Do you think the shit smell wafts over to the mince?

Is that what you're concerned about?

No, it's...

Or just...

Or literal particles.

Like, shit molecules.

Yeah, I never eaten a bathroom.

Yeah.

Here's another one.

Pussy.

Coins are...

Coins are so worthless now that it's gone from...

You can keep the change to...

Can you keep the change?

Wow.

I'm a drabble cartoon.

I enjoyed it.

When is it...

When is it not okay to jerk off to someone based on like, memories?

Like, I got a really good movie theater blowjob in eighth grade, and I feel like that's...

What are you doing in eighth grade?

That's what you're doing?

I know.

That does seem young to get a blowjob.

That wasn't even my first.

That's like...

Really?

How many?

That was my 97th.

What?

But do you think it was 97 different women?

Yeah, it was the year 97 coincidentally.

Wow!

And ever since I've tried to get the amount of year in...

Of year?

So you've only had 15 blowjobs this year?

Well, I'm hoping that they find out this year is only one AD.

Because...

What?

I don't know what you're talking about.

Because I've only gotten one.

Oh, so the new calendar?

You know who it's from?

Me.

Really?

You can suck your own dude?

Yeah.

Bro!

Check it out.

Bro, that's amazing.

Can I check it out?

Can I see you do that?

Oh my God!

Your dick is like a straw!

You're sucking like jizzim right out of your ballsack!

Finally, people talking about dicks!

Yeah!

Chelsea, you want to weigh in?

Love them.

Yep.

Sometimes.

They're okay, right?

Sometimes.

I have a question about...

They're shaped like that.

I have a question...

The competitors come out.

Historically, that is true.

You have a question now, Adam.

Question...

Can I have talk?

I have a question about your 8th grade blowjob.

You said it was really good.

Was it really good because you were in the 8th grade or do you think now it would stand up to all of the blowjobs?

Would it stand the test of time?

I think the penis you have now...

Would it still be a good blowjob?

I think it was...

I think it was really good, but yeah, you make a valid point.

Held with she, by the way.

She was 79.

Did you come to the movie theater together?

Yes.

Was it your grandma?

Did you come together?

Not my grandma.

Yeah.

Did you do anything in return?

Tell this story, bro!

It was oddly like I laid down on the dirty ass floor.

What?

No.

I swear to God.

Really?

Was it the flashback?

Front row?

Was it giving you flashbacks too?

The writer's room at parks.

All we did was listen to Harris tell stories about himself.

His blowjobs were a big hot topic.

It was just nonstop.

So wait, you laid down.

What once again?

Why did you lay down?

He's asking me questions.

Well, who brought up the blowjob though to be fair?

I was in foam corner.

You're still in foam corner, by the way.

Wait, we're all in foam corner.

Oh, yeah.

We're in the middle of foam corner.

But to tell you, sir, you laid down on the sticky floor and you weren't even in the front row?

No, we were like third to last row.

Third to last.

Why did you lay down?

You know what movie we were seeing?

What's half baked?

Mm.

That's just a fun detail.

It's not that fun.

Very good.

And then half baked.

And how did you get it?

That's an already movie.

And I tell you, I was half baked.

Uh-huh.

And then you got a new Texas?

Yeah.

Okay.

And it's like legal.

Okay.

To get a blowjob in a movie theater?

In Texas.

Oh, okay.

This was 97, mind you.

Okay.

So then so.

But wait, I don't understand why you laid down.

Why couldn't she just give you a blowjob?

Because this was pre-lifting armrests.

Yeah, but she just gets in front of you.

But if your penis is big enough, it's...

Like she knew.

Oh, never mind.

If your penis is big enough, bro.

Who's a child's penis?

Well, still in eighth grade, you have a full-sized man's penis.

I used to like be self-conscious about like the pubes I had.

So I put my dick through the hole in the boxers.

Oh my gosh.

You wore the blowjob?

Why would you answer that?

This is therapy, right?

You're every two years.

Too much or too little.

Because of it.

Did you have too much pubes?

No, not enough.

I would have loved more pubes.

Oh, you were like a little.

Then I proceeded to get way too hairy all over.

And I was like, those were the days.

And then did you give anything back?

Did you...

I think I fingered her, but at that...

Oh, how generous.

Yeah, but at that time, you think fingering is just like finger-banging.

How giving?

She like throws your genitals in her mouth and you're like...

Yeah.

You're like a bad job too.

So I didn't know about glitz at the time.

You were laying on your back.

So she was laying on top of you?

She was like...

Did she remain seated?

No, she was on the ground too, on her knees.

Oh, okay.

Downward dog yoga.

And then for the fingering, did you get back in your seats or did you remain laying down?

Fingering was pre.

Okay, and then you go, let's take this to the floor.

So her blowjob was a thank you for the finger.

Those are nice clothes.

They look a lot better on the floor.

With you and them and me also.

In my clothes.

With my boner sticking out of my boxers.

Did she say, hey, do you want to take that?

Do you want to take these off or did she think you were being seated?

What's funny is there were three of us there.

What?

Yeah, it was me and her and then her friend.

This gets worse.

Where's her friend?

Her friend was just like kind of sitting there.

Oh my God.

And if you're listening to this, because one of them is not alive anymore.

Wow, Jesus.

Oh God.

Why are you crying?

This is fucked up.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Harris, which one died?

The blowjob one.

Oh God.

That's not during.

That's nice though, that you're respecting her memory.

I know.

This is horrible.

What happened to her?

I cannot get into her.

Don't go into any.

Yeah, please don't go into any more specificity regarding this issue.

But what about the friend?

Where's she?

Because she sounds down to clowns.

I have to go.

Where are you going?

Harris Harris is like pounding the walls crying right now.

Chelsea, I'm sorry.

Anyway, do you want to finish that phone corner joke?

So you're thinking about a dead person?

Yeah, so basically when is it okay to win?

You need to take the change.

You're right.

That is why it's even more specifically fucked up because she was in eighth grade and she's dead.

Well, I mean, I, is that okay to jerk off to?

I have my question.

I don't, I don't know.

No, it's whatever you want.

I do, I sympathize or maybe empathize with you because one of my first junior high school crushes that I sat behind and she would wear these tank tops all the time and she, and this was in the eighth grade as well and just a blossoming burgeoning body.

She passed away as well.

Really?

And is that okay?

Yes.

You know, you guys and I'm not joking at all.

No, I'm, Adam, Adam is deadly serious by the way.

I've never been more uncomfortable in a room.

Please don't be a huge jerk off to a dev or something.

My first, my first girlfriend.

Yeah.

Yes.

Just like four days before you and I went up to sketch fest.

Yeah.

I found out my very first girlfriend.

Please.

Just die.

Yes.

I'm not kidding.

These things happen in three things happen.

Three things happen.

These things happen.

And the older we get, the more it will happen.

It is so sad.

So when is it okay?

Like, should we let their memories live on by jerking off to?

I, Chelsea weigh in.

We need a female perspective.

I mean, I just don't jerk off to specific people.

Really jerps of people?

You do it to a feeling?

No, it's to imaginary situations, not to.

But imaginary people.

I feel like the guys like see a girl on the subway and they're like, I'm going to jerk off to her later or they have an interaction.

They're like, I'm going to jerk off to that later.

I don't know how most girls are like, are you?

I could only speak for myself.

You can cock imaginary people of your own devising in alternate universes.

Is this really the goal here today?

Talk about this.

What is now?

What is Adam saying?

Why does Adam have his hands folded like a creep?

That is so creepy.

It's like church hands.

I never trust church hands.

They are church hands and their perks right above.

They're not in his lap.

They're right above.

Through my body language telling you I am paying attention.

I'm a safe person.

I'm a safe person to share this with.

That's the message.

I can honestly say this was my goal today.

I'm sure.

Tells you when you pass away, do you want people thinking about you like sexually?

Like, wow, she was really, you know what?

Sex with her was great.

I'm going to continue thinking about that.

Do you want people to?

Let me reframe the question.

Okay, here we go.

If you guys, if you knew that every time you jerked off to a girl or someone that you knew, they would get an alert sent to them.

Oh, or they would die.

Why did you still do it?

They usually do get an alert from me.

On Ambien.

A text.

Shout out to Ambien.

Yeah.

So wait, anytime even like someone pops in your head accidentally and you would say, oh, no, I don't want to, I don't want an alert sent to that person.

No, you can, you can cut it short.

Okay.

But if you choose to proceed, they get an alert.

There's like a seven second delay.

Okay.

So actually like climax, they get no.

Yeah.

If once you start touching yourself, it's over.

They get the alert.

I don't know.

I would like there would be a way of flirting.

It's like sending a link.

I think it's flattering as fuck.

If I got a text that was like, this girl's masturbating to you right now, I'd be like, awesome.

Don't you think girls would be getting alerts constantly all day every day where they would turn them off?

And you're like, you'll get me out of your fucking.

Yeah.

Like someone's stalking.

I think I'm like the first thing he was.

Still kind of cool.

Who's that?

Okay.

Is it Adam?

Nope.

This is going to sound weird.

Okay.

Hugh Laurie.

You hate him the most?

Yeah.

Why?

Never met him.

Never seen him.

It would freak you out or you would, you would find it cool.

No, I'd be into it.

No, I love, I like Hugh Laurie.

But I actually have no opinion.

I just pulled a random person.

And he turned it off.

In this scenario, no one has the power to disable it.

That's not the woman has to be.

It's almost harassing.

It's not her fault.

I mean, right?

Yeah, don't you think men would then jerk off intentionally in order to send an alert?

Like a nudge.

It'd be like someone with harassment.

Yeah.

And is it an alert on your phone or you just see it like Terminator like in your eye?

You see the picture of the person.

And are you a cyborg in this scenario?

I don't know.

But I like your attitude of like just, I'm interested.

I'm interested in this technology.

Yeah.

I'm just thinking about all the girls I know that would get alerts and how embarrassing it would be.

You know what?

Are your phones hooked up to your penis, by the way?

I need to know from a girl's perspective if that's a good move.

Here's the parallel.

Of course not, Harris.

Here's the parallel.

It's not at all.

It's telling someone I had a dream about you.

Like, that's what is a real life actual situation that people do.

If you go, I had a dream about you.

The person is like, okay.

You don't have to tell them.

Although I've had that with women who I know for a fact are just not interested.

I've had women who know I had a dream about you blah, blah, blah, blah.

And it doesn't have to be like, oh, scary.

It was like, I didn't like it.

That's true.

Well, that's just insane.

But I feel like generally people know that it's flirtatious to say that.

Unless you do have an open relationship, I mean, like openly disinterested relationships.

Right, right.

Okay.

So just if you have a crush on someone, tell them, just fake it and say you had a dream about them.

Fake it till you make it.

So is the phone, like, like, does it have a jack to put your penis in?

Well, you know, how is it?

How is it attached?

Is it attached through Bluetooth?

Do you get like a Bluetooth thing in your penis?

It's all virtual.

Okay.

Hate to disappoint.

What does that mean?

I know you want to Bluetooth attachment for your scrot.

I just want like, scrot.

Scrot.

Scrot?

Is that a word for it?

It seems like a Shakespearean word.

Like a scrot.

Well, scrot is dorks backwards and dork is a whale's penis.

It's not dorks backwards.

It really is.

When you think about it, it is.

Scrot.

It actually is.

Number two.

All right.

That was it.

There we go.

Numero.

Dose.

Slow.

All right.

We need to take a break.

When we come back, this is very exciting.

It's all been building to the sky.

We will have your number one.

The most pop and everyone knows what it is at this point, but we'll have your number one of the year when we come back.

Comedy bang bang, we're back here with Paul F. Tonkin.

Hi.

And we're getting to it, man.

We are getting to it.

We're fucking doing it, man.

This is it.

Can I say something, Scott?

Do it, do it.

Magnol mistake.

Why you want to do this?

Do it.

The word is over.

Terrible to do with Michael McDonald's hugs.

No, it's Kenny Logins.

Is it?

Is it both of them?

Is it both of them, maybe?

Wait a minute.

Let me look this up.

No one can tell what the future is.

Make no mistake where you are.

Kenny Logins.

It's Francis.

Featuring Michael McDonald.

Okay.

It's a team up.

We you.

It's like Captain America Civil War.

Oh, Civil War.

This is it Civil War.

What if it came out to it?

This is it Civil War.

Kenny Logins.

Kenny Logins versus Michael McDonald.

Look, Michael McDonald.

I don't agree with what the government is trying to do.

They're just trying to over-sing each other.

No, no, no, no.

Stop.

Shut up.

No one can tell what the future is.

Here's the thing.

I'm proud of us.

Yep.

We said we were going to do this.

We said we were going to count down at number one.

And guess what?

We were fucking did it.

We're fucking did it, man.

Yep.

And how many people, Scott, would you say listening to this said they're never going to do this?

They're never going to do this.

They're fucking they're going to give up.

They're going to quit.

Cowards.

They'll maybe make it to number two.

Remember back when in like, I guess the 40s or the 50s when the worst thing you could call someone was a coward?

You're a coward.

I think it was farther back than that.

I think it was because of the war though.

I think.

Oh, sure.

I think it was in the comics of like, I never knew that you like, you know, if Mr. Fantastic, he has a plan to defeat the thing, but it involves them running away.

Right.

Immediately someone jumps to I never knew you were a coward.

I think what was worse was during the war, people who were shamed because they were physically unable to go to war.

Yeah.

Like a 4F.

4F, huh?

You don't care about your country enough to have a functioning heart.

I'll give you 4Fs.

Fuck you.

There we go.

Classic 40s talk.

Tell you what, we got to get to it.

Let's go to your number one.

Number one.

All right.

You know what?

I want to do something special for this number one and call someone.

Engineer Cody Ryan, could you make that call if you could and unprecedented.

And we'll see exactly what happens.

Here we go.

Calling here it happens.

Hello.

Hey, Nong Man.

Hi, Jason.

How are we?

Oh, Jason Manzukas says I live and breathe.

What a wonderful treat.

Oh, it's a good light.

Most wonderful time of the year.

Where are you?

Where?

Why could you not be in the studio here?

I am in New York City.

Oh, New York City.

How are we?

Our nation's capital.

I don't know about that, but OK.

Let's not look into it.

Where are you going?

Where are you located in New York City address, please?

I will just give you.

I am on the low-reside current.

L.E.S.

Yeah, gentlemen.

You're a L.E.S.

Do we got you?

I'm in the U.S.

I'm deep in the L.E.S.

Jason, he got you.

What are you doing out there in New York?

It was your birthday, was it not?

Today is my birthday.

Today's your birthday.

Happy birthday.

Happy birthday to you.

I'm a Peve and Jared Jason.

I'm a Peve and went to UTA.

We're going to have time.

Jiz.

Oh, that was really great.

Are you real?

For real, man?

It was very good.

I will say that when you guys say Mr. Fango Banner, it was better.

Last time we were together, but this was wonderful.

What episode was that again, by the way?

Do you remember?

I was trying to think of that the other day.

It was the one we did most recently.

I can't remember what it was.

The one with numbers.

Numbers can't lie.

Numbers cannot lie.

Which, by the way, is Jermaine to this conversation because your number one episode of the year is, of course, I said it when Jay picked up the phone.

It's Hainong Man.

Hainong Man.

The catchphrase that took America by storm.

I'm getting a lot of, I will say this, I'm getting a lot of Hainong Man on the streets of New York.

By the way, we made this pledge to America.

If you see us on the street and I pray that you do.

Come up to us and say Hainong Man.

We love it.

We will always say it back.

One caveat to that.

Upon us saying it back, immediately walk away.

Immediately.

Even sooner if possible.

Consider the conversation reset and walk away.

Also, I have another caveat.

We all get one caveat.

Don't punch us in the stomach, Harry Houdini style.

Oh, that's a good one.

That's a good one.

Okay, what do you got Paul?

My caveat.

Don't frame me for murder.

Oh, that's a good one too.

Okay.

All right.

I will say this.

Just for Paul's caveat.

Don't frame any of us for murder would be great.

Oh, yeah.

Thanks for including us.

Whoa, that's my caveat.

Shit.

Everyone just won.

Damn it.

You can't punch any of us in the stomach.

That's right.

You can frame Jason or I for murder.

That's right.

Correct.

Hainong Man.

I mentioned that it was germane to this conversation because that last one that we taped is sort of a spiritual sequel to Hainong Man because in that one we spoke to the other side of the conversation than we did in Hainong Man because we were in Hainong Man we're speaking to Mike the janitor.

That's right.

And in the last episode where Paul sang the Star Spangled Banner we were speaking to what is his name?

Atherton Witherflower.

Atherton Witherflower who did the life swap, life swap.

That's right.

With the janitor.

With the human margery.

Yep.

Anyway I got a lot of compliments on my rendition of the Star Spangled Banner.

Oh yeah.

Because it was legit beautiful.

It was not...

No.

It's like Heidi Klum or something.

Legit beautiful.

Like I know you're a model but sometimes a model when you look at them you know up close is not that beautiful.

Like Heidi Klum is legit beautiful.

Ew.

You have a true, true beauty and some of these other models look like a bag of garbage.

They look like what is Dick Francis a horse?

What's this going on?

Jason, hold on.

Yeah, yeah.

Can I ask you a question?

Do you know the mystery author Dick Francis?

No I don't.

Oh.

So you don't know if he's a horse or not?

If the author Dick Francis is a horse?

Yeah.

Do you know if Dick Francis is a horse?

Jason you...

Where is he?

He sounds like...

He sounds like real little kids.

I'm the head of something I know I am.

Look this is the fourth...

Literally we're going into our fifth hour now of recording these.

So...

And you've gotten all the way to number one now.

Yes.

This is number one.

Yeah.

How's it feel to know that you were part of the number one?

You were last door too.

You were last door with Andy Daille.

Oh that's right.

And were you the year before too?

I don't know.

What was last year's?

Last year was...

Here was...

I think was Time Bobby too.

Oh yeah, yeah.

So last year was the Andy Daille doing several characters.

That was episode three.

Got it.

And the year before was Time Bobby too.

Yeah.

And the year before that Time Bobby won.

Yes.

That's right.

Jason were tied for number one.

Number one.

Although I've been on three number ones.

Oh.

What's your third?

Hey, Nong Man.

That's right.

Hey, Nong Man.

We've been...

Look, if you haven't heard the Hey Nong Man episode, you're about to hear a giant chunk of it.

You'll hear the...

By the way, this is one week after Kid Detectives, which we just heard.

So we were in a good streak.

A lot of these...

It's interesting when we've been going back over these.

How close together some of these episodes were.

Like we'll hit like two in a row that are really, really great and then we'll live fallow for months.

Like October and November.

Oh boy.

Nothing from there.

I would like to say because I know that...

Oh, Jason, I'm sorry.

Sorry, Jason.

If you want to say something, please say your name first and then what you're here to say.

Yes.

Hey, Jason Manzuk is here.

And you're here to what?

And I'm here to say a little something to you guys.

I truly enjoyed being on the show so much this year, especially getting to do a bunch of episodes with you, Paul, which has never happened before and was an absolute delight.

Jason, that was a treat for me too.

I'm so glad that it finally happened.

It was a wonderful experience for me as well.

I could take or leave it.

So...

Screw you, Jer.

No, Jason.

We talked about it earlier in this countdown.

We were not privy to it about how great it was that you decided to do so many episodes and you came to me early on in the year and said you wanted to do more.

And it was great to have you on so often this year.

I love doing it with the both of you guys.

And the number one episode can clearly attest to that.

We're having a ton of fun on it.

Oh, yeah.

2,000 pounds worth, I would say.

Hey, no, man.

All right.

So in this clip, you will hear the inception of Hainong Man, which came about from me not hearing Jason correctly, me being a dumb idiot.

So a lot of times on the top 10, a lot of these episodes are voted in because of the character segment.

This one, the character segment is great, but the pre-character segment is so great, too.

So we included a lot of the pre-character segment.

So you'll hear just you and me, Jason, riffing back and forth.

And then Mike, the janitor comes in.

We don't get to hear a lot of his plot, which is wanting to clean up garbage island.

Go back and listen to the episode to hear kind of the ins and outs of his plot, but we're going to hear a lot of just kind of us goofing around and joking around.

So how's that sound to you?

Goose and jokes.

Love it.

Yeah.

You doing anything special for your birthday?

I'm going to go out to dinner with some friends.

What are you eating?

Pussy?

I'm going to burn this city to the ground.

Yeah.

Death to America.

Wait a minute.

Oh, no.

This close.

Oh, you got me fired up.

I've been running the lies.

Hang on, man.

Oh, my God.

Oh, that was close.

It was too close.

All right, Jason, thank you so much for taking our call on a special day for you.

Thank you guys.

Have a great one.

All right, you too.

Bye, buddy.

Hang on, man.

All right, we are going to hear it.

You ready for it?

This is your number one of the year.

Here we go.

This is, hey, no man, your number one.

Number one.

You should have a season where you are tonight show style, like choosing who your successor is.

And is it going to go to Letterman or Leno kind of thing where you are, you know, who will get the show?

We'll take it over.

I think it would be fun, wouldn't it?

I think 100% of it would just get it to new blood in there.

Yes.

You know what I mean?

I believe I've pitched you.

I would like there to be an episode where I am like a Gary Shanling style guest host, because for some reason you haven't shown up, you know?

And if you want to make it that you've been kidnapped, that is fine.

We're definitely thinking about that.

The reveal is that I am behind your kidnapping.

Oh, I like it.

Because you look Arab.

Hang on, man.

Would you say me?

Hang on, man.

Hey, young man.

New t-shirt.

Hey, young man.

You know, it's a classic hang on, man.

This is a total hang on man situation.

Oh, Jason.

Jason.

Oh, Scottie Scottie.

What's been going on in your life?

I know you moved to an undisclosed location.

I've moved to an undisclosed location, which is lovely.

I bought an undisclosed location.

I have just moved into it.

Very exciting.

Does this place have a shitter?

No.

I bought a house that specifically just has an outhouse.

Okay.

Well, that's good.

Yeah, you don't want that kind of smell in the house.

You know, and I don't want guests pooping up in my house.

You know, so...

That's one way to keep them out.

So I have a cool...

I have a porta potty out in the back.

And it's classy.

But it's a classy one.

I put a chandelier in the porta potty.

Oh, yeah, you have those raised sinks.

Yep.

What are those called?

I don't know.

I had one once.

Really?

Remember when those were in Vogue?

I had one in one bathroom.

No, I don't know what you mean.

You know the sinks that aren't...

I know what you mean, though.

Yes.

Now that you've done a hand motion, that tells me what you mean.

Yes, I get it.

So now that you know these sinks...

Don't make a jerk off motion.

Keep it classy, man.

This is a fucking family show.

People want to know...

Who?

About...

The fans.

The fans are interested.

Oh, the fans are interested.

No.

It's been just about a year, maybe.

I think maybe.

But people want to know what you're up to.

I mean, certainly you have your own podcast, but...

I do.

How did this get made podcast on the Ear Wolf network?

Surrounded on iTunes.

Certainly.

And you guys have not been in the same room together, nor will you ever be again.

We just did.

We just did two episodes live in New York, all together.

And they were glorious.

Really exciting.

Hercules in New York starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is in his first film role, which is legit terrible.

Wait, so the rock was in Hercules too?

He was.

He was just recently in Hercules.

Interesting.

So they both tried it out and it did not...

Lou Ferrigno as well.

Really?

Very famously.

What is it about these muscle men where they go, you know what?

I'm looking in the mirror and I think that I could play Hercules.

I think that...

I think everybody looks at a muscle man as like, what strong man can this person play?

Well, you know, in a way it's better than, you know, like, what role realistically would people buy this person as?

You know?

Like, more realistically, it's like every time Arnold Schwarzenegger is in a movie, you expect one person to go, hey man, what's up with your accent?

Yes.

Yeah, how am I supposed to believe, I mean, in this movie he's meant to be a Greek god and has like...

But in something like kindergarten cop or whatever, it's like, hey man, how often do you work out?

Are you like five hours a day?

Yes.

Hasn't even hold a job.

I agree.

Or how about twins where he is a straight up scientist?

Where he's a scientist who has an Austrian accent and is built like a bodybuilder.

It's bananas.

Not twins, juniors.

Sorry, juniors.

Junior, junior, junior, junior.

That's the one where he...

It gets pregnant with a baby.

How does he do a process?

And the process is as a woman in order to cover it.

Does he stick his penis into his butt?

Like, how does it happen?

He sticks his penis in his butt because he's ovulating from his butt.

Because he has a butt-jina?

Is this what you wanted?

This is what I wanted.

This is what you want out of a J-man.

Yeah.

Do people call you the J-man?

People call me J-man or J-dog all the time.

Yeah.

And I hate it.

I will never stop.

Never stop.

What is happening with...

You know, people are very concerned about your dating life.

They want to know that you're happy.

They hear about you flipping through vaginas earlier.

Just flipping through like a paperback book.

Like a Patricia Highsmith novel.

What is it about paperback books that you just like flip through?

You don't even read them.

Like a money-counting machine.

Yeah, like a...

That's exactly like a money.

Like a money-counting machine and a drug dealer's den.

You've been flipping through vaginas like a money-counting machine.

That's $100,000.

I'm a $100,000.

I like that image of you.

But are you happy in your life are you...

I'm happy in my life.

I am single still.

If that's what you're asking.

That's what the ladies want to know.

The ladies are very interesting.

The ladies listen to podcasts.

I don't know.

The ladies listen to this stuff.

Of course there are any women who tune into the comedy band podcast.

We have wonderful, wonderful feel.

I like to think this podcast in particular is all inclusive.

I like to think it's for everybody.

It is.

I know that.

I feel like there are plenty of wonderful women tuning into this.

And ladies, hello.

Welcome to the podcast.

Is that the way you talk to ladies?

I'm sensing the problem.

This is a podcast.

Hey there ladies.

Hello, you listen to podcast.

If there were to be a female listener out there...

Yeah.

And we're only saying that because that is your preference.

Yes.

There was a female listener out there who was...

Her preference was males.

And her preference actually was males who were a lot like you.

Sure.

Who was into you and were to reach out to you somehow.

No.

There's no way to reach out to you there.

There is.

Really?

No.

How do you date then?

How do I date then?

Without any kind of social media presence so that people can contact me out of the blue.

Back when I was dating.

So let me know that they want to date me.

Back when I was dating is pre-social media.

Sure.

I just by walking around being handsome and people coming up to me.

No, do you just say handsome or handsy?

Hey, Nog man.

I like that we are both writing the word hang-nog.

I love so you remember it.

So that we don't forget it.

I had fear in my eyes and I forgot it and I pulled it out the last second.

I'm impressed.

And you used it correctly as well.

But how do you do it?

How does a J-dog...

How do you meet a woman?

Do you see her eyes from across a crowded room?

Yeah, I just go to crowded rooms.

That's a hand to go.

And I look across them and I see if anybody can...

Like she's an efficient apparel.

When I make eyes, when I lock eyes with somebody across the room, I walk across the room and I say, hey Nog man.

And then it's on.

And then we're just like...

And then it's on like Nog man.

It's on like Donkey Nog.

Oh boy.

Do you want paper?

What do you want?

I want paper.

Do you want paper?

What do you want?

Hey, you want paper?

What do you want?

Hey, you want paper?

Hey, baby.

Who's this guy?

Is this the paper seller character that you've been working on?

Hey, I bought the paper.

Oh yeah.

Is the office still on?

I'm trying to get a job on the office selling paper.

Okay, you're gonna be so severely disciplined.

Really?

Oh yeah.

Oh wait, do you mean an American workplace?

Also office.

Oh, bananas.

Well, is this your banana selling character?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

But you're, you know what?

I would say that you're at the height of your powers.

The height of my powers, but let's be honest, it's not cute anymore to be single, I think at my age.

Right, yeah.

I think it's not a cute thing to be a 42 year old man who's single.

But do you want?

Probably not cute to talk about it on a podcast either.

Well, is that a fear for women who date you with that you're gonna be talking about them on these podcasts?

Well, that's all I do, bro.

All I do is sleigh-tang and then get on the casts to talk about it.

Sleigh-tang.

Oh bro, sleigh-tang.

Oh, are you kidding?

Yeah, that's like, you know that.

You know my new earwolf podcast.

What's that?

Talking tang.

Although, no, I'm just doing like this.

No, I'm just doing a to me and it's like this.

That is one of the only podcasts with two apostrophes talking and then.

Talking tang.

Yeah.

Talking and it's a, and it's an end.

Yeah, it's an end and then a start right next to each other.

Perfect.

Those are like two boobs.

By the way, next to each other.

That's the image.

Will fans please make an image for talking tang the podcast?

And it's just two apostrophes.

The apostrophes are boobs.

Yeah, so it's a closed one and an open one and they're just boobs.

I would like that.

Please everybody, let's make that and then maybe I'll make that podcast.

Yeah, I actually, I actually am very interested in that.

Yeah, right after I make the other one that I think I came up with in a, how did this get made which is the, the Chardonnay podcast.

Oh, what is that?

We all just drink Chardonnay and talk.

Oh, that sounds like a dream.

It's, yeah.

It's like a ladies book club.

Oh man, I would love that.

What, the, the shard cast I think I call this?

Shard cast.

That sounds disgusting actually.

But you want to be, you want to be married even though you want to be married with the singularity coming.

What is identity anyway and why should we be tethered to not only these bodies but with other bodies?

Oh, well, are we going to get into X Machina?

What are we, how are we, how are we coming at this?

Oh, with the singularity shame on you.

Um, no, of course I want to be in a, in a relationship.

I'm a, you know, again, I'm middle aged at this point.

This is getting to be.

You hope, you hope.

I hope, yeah.

You may, you may have been middle aged at 23 for all you know.

We simply don't know.

We can only give me a few more years on earth.

Yeah, 23 could have been your hump year.

Oh God.

When you think about what, here, when you think about it, at what year did you have sex the most and that is probably your, your hump year and then you can calculate when you're going to die?

No.

Yeah.

So think of the year that you had the most sex where you were just talking tang and just sleigh tang.

Oh yeah.

Just talking tang.

All year and then double that and that's the year you're going to die because that was your hump year.

Hmm.

This is a good theory.

It's a great theory about it.

And is it that you think you, does your body know?

Your body knows you're getting it out of the way.

Your body is like, no, you're going to die at this point.

So I'm going to give you the middle of your life.

I'm going to give you the most.

So I'm going to guess somewhere in my thirties.

I'm going to, I'm going to guess that I'm going to live to be in my, then if your theory is true, somewhere in late sixties, I bet.

I'm late fifties at best.

Yep.

Yeah.

Boy, not.

Well, you know, the widow cool up.

Look, when you're listening back to this after I've died, there's a lot of references to me dying.

Oh yeah.

You know, if you're listening back to this after I'm gone, this is, this is morbid.

This is good.

You know, like this podcast will serve as you're living well speaking of which, do you have a do not resuscitate?

Do you want to be a DNR?

Yeah, if you are felled by some accident that does not leave you dead, but leaves you in capacitance, people should use their own common sense.

In a vegetative state.

Yeah.

Where it's like, you know what?

And not even like my own farts in your face wake you up from this coma.

What happens?

Wait, is that what's happening?

Well, how else am I supposed to make you up?

Are you traveling around to your best friends hospital beds and farting in their faces?

It behooves me to try anything possible to wake you up.

You are one of my extraordinary measures.

One of my absolute best friends.

And if my own fart, don't wait to do.

I'd rather not be one of your best friends.

Out of nostalgia, if nothing else.

Then I don't know.

No, no, no, no, no.

For that night, it rob you all is a bachelor party.

When we slept in the same room.

On, on, on, on mass.

The hardest, on the floor.

Like we were like, we were like, we were like, three fucking dogs.

Like we are too old to like, we were like, we were kids.

I live, I stayed there one night and I was supposed to stay a second.

I was like, I, I can't do it.

I stay too.

And the mats on the floor, I, I, it took me days to recover.

They were like, rocks.

Took me days to recover.

They were terrible.

I did, I didn't recover the next day.

That's why I took off.

But we, we cuddled.

We did.

We, and Aziz was in the same room.

That what, what a powerhouse room.

It's a real name drop of people sleeping on floors.

Adult men sleeping on floors.

Oh boy.

But you know, so far that marriage is going well.

So all the power to him.

Absolutely.

Congratulations.

What do you, what do you dream of your wedding having?

Ever since you were a little boy, did you assume you would have like a white tuxedo with tails and a top hat?

I feel like it starts with everybody skiing down a mountain.

All in, you know, in a bride and dress me and all my great, everybody skiing down a mountain.

Do people need to know how to ski or they're just like, push into.

Yeah.

So, so some lessons.

So lessons might have to happen or just everybody in the wedding party will just be shredding.

Just naturally, just be natural shredders.

Natural born shredder.

You like to slay tang.

Absolutely.

And then I will, I will record, we will get to the bottom.

We'll say our vows.

I will record an episode of slain to talk in tang because you know, this is the last, this is the last one.

Really?

This is the last episode of talk in tang series finale series finale because I'm getting married.

So I'm not going to be talking tang anymore.

What have you did though?

You could still talk tang.

I guess I could talk tang, but just it's all my wife's tang.

It's just like, oh well, I would depending on who you marry, I would listen to that even more.

Oh, it's interesting.

I'm marrying the widow Koolop.

Oh, you said it.

All right, I'll listen.

Because here's the thing, if you haven't noticed, I have to take over everything once you die.

Really?

So this is a full life swap?

It's like in the, it's like in the past when somebody would die and their brother would have to marry their wife and take over their responsibilities.

I mean, I, I've heard of a wife swap.

I had a friend once who did a wife swap that turned into a life swap.

Oh.

Yeah.

He swamped.

He, that's actually, he was a, he was a mathematician in Boston, I believe.

Oh.

And he became a janitor because he swapped wives with a janitor and he had to take over that person's life.

This is good, good, well, hunting style.

Yeah, it was sort of good.

Well, this is like a reverse.

Dolan, Skarsgard, Matt Damon, Swaparoo, seller skateboard.

Yeah, stellar skateboard.

I understand.

Yeah, you understand how it is.

But anyway, it's not worth bringing him up, but it certainly wasn't worth derailing the show for him.

Oh, but I, I, I'm, I'm happy to have another opportunity to put out into the world the stellar skateboard situation.

Certainly.

So you would take over everything you would what?

My car, my shoes?

No, we get, no, but I will take all of your comic books.

Okay.

Happily.

Hey, you know what?

Actually a room full of comic books that I love.

Do you, do you want those when I die?

Yes.

I think, I can think of no one else who wants them.

I can think of a couple of people, but I would like them.

All right.

They're yours.

Done.

This is binding unless I change my will and you go into that big room.

Of course.

The lawyer surprises you.

Something where my heirs have changed the will.

Son of a bitch.

Oh God.

That would make me furious.

And like Neil Campbell winds up with all of the, all of the comic books.

Oh boy.

No, done.

You got him.

You've been, you've been down in that room.

Great.

I have.

So I get the comic books.

I get bang, bang the podcast, bang, the TV show and cool up.

Right?

This is not so, what do I get?

I was like, I get all them.

Do I get anything in life?

You get buried, dude.

You get in the ground.

That's what's happening.

But it's, do you want to be cremated?

Do you want to be buried?

What's going to happen?

I think cremated.

I think it's, it's a weird waste of space to have graveyards everywhere.

I agree.

Here's the only, cause I feel the same.

Put some condos up, baby.

I feel the same.

But here is the only thing that I do, that I, that I can appreciate in a way is shouldn't we rot and give life to the earth?

Shouldn't we decay and decompose and divide fertilizer for the earth?

They make fertilizer.

You can go buy it.

I also want to be cremated.

But then I was like, oh, maybe I should just be buried in a shallow grave somewhere.

Why shallow?

I don't know.

So I can rotten, like people will smell it and be like, what's that?

Yeah.

A shallow grave just like, just so my nose and beard are above, are above the wall of the ground.

As serving as your tombstone.

Yep.

I want to be frozen in carbon.

I had hunts all those times.

With your hands out.

Like, don't freeze me.

Don't freeze me, bro.

Hey, no, man.

Don't freeze me.

I'm really enjoying it.

No, man.

It's pretty fantastic.

You really like it.

Like, we are barely minutes into this and have come up with Hey, none, man.

And talking to.

And slitting.

What do you like about cereal and podcast in general, Mike?

Ooh, let's see.

Do I pass the time?

I'm cleaning up.

Podcast in general, that's tough to answer because I've only ever heard the word.

Because I've only ever heard the one podcast.

You've just listened to cereal.

Just listen to cereal.

I understand this American life is also a podcast.

It can be.

I mean, it also is on the radio.

It isn't can be.

And what's the show Washington Week?

I like that podcast as well.

Yeah.

Very good.

And slate political gap fest.

And sleight tang.

And sleight tang I enjoy.

Of course.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Talk and tang.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Listen, I'm just getting into talking.

What do you think of their logo?

It's despicable.

Yep.

I've never seen anything quite like it before.

Yep.

It looks just like cleavage.

There's going to be a bunch of episodes of talking tang where I'm just talking the tang of women who are lactating.

So the apostrophes are both going to be dripping, dripping milk.

Oh, dear.

Yeah.

Dripping milk.

Now you had that experience before.

You've talked about it on this show.

Those episodes will be called talking tang colon dripping milk.

Now you know, I'm starting.

Dripping apostrophe milk.

I'm starting a podcast called Dripping Milk.

Oh, what?

Which is about, from the time that I cleaned up a high school cafeteria and those bags, very thin bags.

Just that one time you cleaned up a high school cafeteria?

Well, one time in my life.

Oh, yeah.

I did it for many years.

Okay.

How often would those bags be dripping milk?

Every single time?

Are you talking?

100%.

Milk bags are notoriously ripped.

A little milk bag.

Oh.

That's kind of talk.

Oh, yeah.

Big juicy milk bags.

You know what I'm talking about?

Oh, you guys are both disgusting.

Big juicy milk bags.

Why are you constantly high-fiving?

Because we're killing it.

Five high-fiving.

The question is, why aren't you?

Yeah.

I guess so.

Yeah.

I'm in.

You're just high-fiving yourself.

You just clapped.

You're not.

No, what high-fives are.

Yeah.

You know, after someone gives a wonder, you go see a band and it's a wonderful song and you high-fiving yourself.

That's clap.

You clap like you just learn how to do it.

It's a little bait.

No, it's because I'm high-fiving myself.

And you look amazed at the sound.

You're looking down to your hands like you're trying to figure out where it came from.

Guys.

What do you want?

Hey, can I ask you?

Yeah.

Since I'm on the microphone and I got this public for me.

Am IKE on the M.I.C.?

Yeah, because dripping milk has not dropped yet.

I would like to ask the help of your listeners if there are any.

The help to...

Great movie.

Not worth it.

Are you sure?

I don't know.

I thought that worth it at first and then I started thinking about it in the silence.

And I was like, that might have been worth it.

Nope.

No.

Nope.

I think so.

Hey, no, man.

I think it was pretty good.

Hey, no, man.

I would like to ask...

I like...

Hey, no, man.

Is it kind of...

Like a sorbet.

Like resets, every...

Hey, no, man.

Resets.

PCs?

You say PCs?

I do say PCs.

Yeah.

Have we talked about this?

We have.

Let me speak.

Okay.

Stop it.

All right.

But it isn't.

Hang on, man.

Let's get back on stress.

Hang on, man.

We all three have to say in order to reset.

All right.

Now, I'm only too excited to discuss and continue.

Whatever it is.

All right.

But we have all three sounds.

That's right.

So we can move on.

All right.

I would like to ask if your listeners would direct themselves on their computers.

I have a desktop hot laptop.

You don't care about the style of computer.

No, it doesn't matter to me.

You don't...

What about sitting on a desk or on a lap and still computing?

What about Mac or PC?

And like Mac or PC?

Does it matter?

It does not matter to me.

I, of course, don't use a computer.

I write everything out long end.

Oh, wow.

And I feel like it's not up to me to judge what kind of devices people like to use.

Like if you got a smartphone, if you got a dumb phone, if you got a flip phone, if you got a rotary phone, you carry around on a tray.

For a calculator or an abacus.

That I don't like.

We don't bring phones to people on trays anymore.

And that makes me sad.

Yeah.

It was just like a cell phone on a tray.

That would be fun.

That'd be cool.

If somebody was like a phone call for you.

Or like a cake dish above it.

How about the cake dish?

How about if you were in a fancy restaurant?

What's that?

What?

How about if you were in a fancy restaurant and you were getting a call and then the waiter would take your phone from you.

Sure.

Go back into the kitchen and bring it out.

And then bring it out.

I think what you have to have.

Why would you cut me off before I finished the idea?

I like cutting people off.

That's his favorite thing.

It's his favorite thing.

His favorite thing is to come in.

Hey, no man.

No, it's your favorite thing.

That's what's annoying about it.

Get a reset going.

Damn it.

Reset the gun.

Hang on, man.

No, I'm not interested in it.

I want to keep digging in.

You won't let the reset.

I want to.

Okay.

Hang on.

Come on.

I'm going to be taking a look at the other side of the house.

I'm going to be taking a look at the house.

Does the employee have to earn that respect?

Yes.

May I say this?

Earn that respect by going undercover, undercover boss and learning who the little guys are who work here.

That would be kind of fun to go undercover boss at this Ed ear wolf.

It would be.

How would you accomplish the illusion?

What would you do?

I don't know.

I think I'd have to go full sex change or something.

I don't know.

Okay.

This seems very extreme.

This is just an excuse to go get a sex change.

Well, you know, look, do you think anyone has our own way?

Sex change is a gigantic procedure.

Do you think anyone ever embarked on that?

I'm not turning by saying, I'm going to go get a sex change.

You know what?

Today?

What if it was, you know what?

Didn't say anything to anyone until we saw him.

Hey, listen, I'll be back in a little bit.

I'm going to go get a sex change.

I'll be back before dinner.

And of course, big ups to people of all different stars and stripes.

Big ups to all people of different stars and stripes is what you just gave.

Some things.

The week that Caitlin Caitlin Jenner has announced just up to the world you're giving up.

You're giving big ups to her.

Oh, I had people of all stars and stripes.

I think something's legitimately wrong with you.

I think you are having a stroke.

Maybe.

Look, this is possibly my.

The bleep.

Hey, no, man.

I think we should.

Okay.

Thank you.

Okay.

Oh, gosh.

Number one.

Oh, so good.

We did it.

We made it through another year.

It's New Year's Eve.

That was so much fun.

That was my first time doing the show with Jason.

No, you've done some.

Oh, yeah.

But those are like when there's so many people.

Yeah.

It's not quite the same thing.

So just, you know, just how do you say three people?

I was going to say one on one, but like one on two or two on one.

How do you say three people?

It was two on one when we ganged up on you.

Yeah.

No, you're and you are always ganging up on me, by the way.

That's what Jason brings that out in people.

Yeah.

Because you'd rather be on his side.

Okay.

Well, because otherwise the other two people would hang up on you.

That's true.

Well, Jason's very, he's very playful and very mischievous, and it's always a lot of fun to play with him.

Yeah.

He's almost like a comedy Santa Claus.

He's playful.

He's mischievous.

He puts his finger to his nose.

He loves cookies.

You don't want Santa put his finger to his nose, by the way, and he flew away, supposedly.

Yeah.

Do you think that was just an excuse?

He was like picking a booger and someone saw it.

I think, no, I think that's actually how he flies.

I don't think he can fly otherwise.

I think he has to.

So it's like the ignition button is in his nose.

I think he laid a finger aside of his nose.

Well, that's the thing.

Was it like Jerry Seinfeld?

Was it a pick or was it a, you know, like, was he picking his nose?

Some kid saw it and was like, oh, I think there's a big difference between putting your finger in your nose and weirdly putting it on the side of your nose.

No, but if you look at, look at, look at me from the side.

Oh, and I think you have your finger up to the second knuckle?

Okay, over there, right?

So he's picking it like to the side and all the kid sees is this, right?

First of all, you got a microphone in front of your fucking face.

Okay, now I can see it.

So a kid sees this.

Santa sees, he's got his nose up there.

He sees the kid and goes, I'll do this to fly.

Bye!

So he puts it all together instantly.

Yeah.

Why does he scold the kid for being awake?

Well, yeah.

That's a good point.

All right.

I guess my theory fell apart there.

There we go.

All right.

I'll rise.

I'll rise by a kiss.

Well, I want to thank you, Paul, for being here.

You don't have to do this.

It's the last day before Christmas vacation.

I get to do that, Strahd.

That's true.

This is always a special time.

This is a special time.

It is.

It's where we hang out for four hours straight.

That's right.

And riff continuously for it.

And I love doing it.

And I may listen to these.

Have you never listened back to an episode?

I do when I have to make these.

That's the only time.

Maybe once in a rare while.

Sometimes Kool-Off will listen to one in the house and I'll dip in and out and hear a little bit of it.

But yeah, I don't really listen to it now.

But I do for the best ofs.

I always catch up and I'm always like, like, I know in my head about the Santa Claus challenging me to a fight because so many people have written about it and I go, oh, yeah, I remember it sort of conceptually.

But listening, I was like crying laughing to it last night listening.

It's really funny.

So I always enjoy listening back to these.

And this is the only time I really do it.

Well, if you know you're going to do this, you might as well just wait until you just have to do it.

But thank you so much for being here.

I really appreciate it.

Scott, oh God.

Thank you.

I've said it before and I'll say it again.

Some of the happiest hours of my entire life have been spent in this studio doing these shows.

I mean, I sincerely mean that.

It's always so much fun.

It's so much fun.

And we're a lot of people don't know we're drenched in sweat when we finish every episode, every single episode.

First of all, we all show up in tuxedos.

Of course, you have to.

It's a podcast by the by the end drenched in sweat.

Ties are loose.

Who established the tuxedo rule about podcast, by the way, because it is not convenient.

Was it Adam Corolla?

Certainly it was Adam Corolla.

Of all people?

Absolutely.

I mean, it's like those weird rules of how you dress for dinner back in the 1920s.

Oh my God.

Can you imagine like somebody showed up in just a regular coat, not a tail coat?

Can you believe it?

Oh my goodness.

I threw my cold soup on the ground.

But I do want thank you so much, Paul, for that for those kind words.

I almost said wise words.

I know wise words.

But thank you.

And most importantly, I want to thank the listeners, the listeners who voted and the listeners who didn't vote.

And whatever intersection they have.

The Venn diagram of those people.

The overlap of listeners who didn't.

It was very small sliver.

Very small.

Almost nonexistent.

No, but to anyone who listened this year, I really appreciated the fact that anyone still cares six years on is unbelievable to me.

So I appreciate it.

And I appreciate your kind words that you send to me.

I have not been very good about getting back to anyone on Twitter this year.

It's been a busy year, but I did it for myself.

But I do appreciate everyone sending me nice things.

It really does make me feel like this is worth it and is doing something nice for the people out there.

The nice people.

Is it fun for you to do this show?

It is fun.

It is worth it.

I guess I mean that I'm not just talking to dead air.

You're not just...

You're imaginary.

As my...

Yeah, of course.

Everyone knows that.

So when I'm talking to dead air when I'm here in the studio.

You want to know you're not, as my friend Casey says, shouting down the toilet.

Yes.

Thank you, Casey.

Who's this Casey?

She's a friend of mine, a very funny comedy writer, Casey St. Auln.

Oh, great.

She's one of the producers of Watch What Happens Live.

Yes, I've seen her on Twitter.

Yes, you have.

I was thought it was Cassie.

Everyone knows because it's spelled weird and even she will tell you that she wishes it wasn't.

Well, she can do something about it.

She's a grown ass woman.

Too late.

Too many forms.

Ah, how many?

One?

I bet there's no.

If you change your name.

Yeah.

How many do you have to do?

Triplekit.

It's not just the form to change your name.

You then have to change every document.

Every document you've ever signed?

Back to grade school?

Yeah.

Back to grade school.

No, all your social security, driver's license, all those things have to be changed.

Yeah, I guess so.

That's why Cooloff did not take your name when she got married.

Do you have to do it when you do that?

Even?

Oh, God, that's a pain in the ass.

Janie did it and I don't know why she did it.

I didn't ask her to do it.

She's Janie Tompkins?

I thought she was JJ J. J. J. J. J. J. had had Tompkins.

And she had to change all that stuff and it was a gigantic pain in the ass.

Why does anyone do it?

Why does anyone get married?

Nah.

That's a topic of another product.

That's a tough product.

I don't know if you guys can talk about it.

That's a tough product.

I don't know if you guys can talk about it.

Should all the Quaintants be forgot and ever brought to mind.

Should all the Quaintants be forgot and all the oldlings are.

I don't know if you guys can talk about it.
