♪♪♪ Slap my ass and call me Sally, my favorite maps are Rand McNally.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Mmm, thank you to Tim for that catchphrase submission.

Tim, on the new CBVworld.com slash plugs, catchphrase submissions.

We say, how would you like to be referred to?

And it's just Tim.

Thank you, Tim. Really appreciate that catchphrase submission.

And welcome to Comedy Bang Bang for another week.

We have a great show for you today.

Coming up a little later, we have a dancer.

We also have a concerned citizen.

And my name is Scott Ockermann.

And welcome to the show.

Before we get to them, I have someone I'm going to bring on first.

And it says here he is a co-host.

That's interesting.

This show has never had a co-host before, but maybe he's a co-host for another show.

Like Matt Gorley is to that Conan O'Brien show, or Andy Richter was to that Conan O'Brien show.

Let's bring him on.

Please welcome Ted Nougie.

Hey, Scott, thank you.

Hey, it's so great to meet you.

It's so great to meet you too.

Ted Nougie.

How do you spell your last name?

Any WGY?

And you're right, I am a co-host.

You're a co-host.

I am not, obviously, the co-host of your show.

Oh, you're not?

Okay, go on.

I was worried there was some sort of shake-up from corporate going on.

I am the co-host.

You're not going to even just acknowledge anything I say.

You're just going to barrel ahead.

What did you say?

This is what I'm talking about.

I'm so sorry.

You're in your head right now.

I'm a little nervous because I'm used to being on my podcast that I co-host.

What is your podcast you mind if I ask?

It's called Murder Was Wrote, and it is a false crime podcast.

False crime.

Yes, meaning I guess I've never heard of pre-crime, obviously, from Minority Report.

I don't know if you've ever seen that movie.

I've seen it.

It's on my list, but I haven't seen it.

Colin Farrell from Banshee's If you're going to call in, please call in Farrell.

No, this is a gentleman.

This is a...

Oh.

Any truly is a gentleman.

I've never seen him not in a tux.

No, I've only seen him on the Oscars.

Oh, you've never seen him in a movie that he's been acting in?

No, I have not.

I know him as a celebrity who was on the Oscars once.

He does not play James Bond, although he might...

I cannot say what people do in their personal lives.

Oh, that's a good point.

Have you ever played James Bond?

Well, I'd rather not say on a microphone.

Painted your girlfriend gold.

We don't get into...

Oh, no.

That's a very sad story.

Oh, what is this?

I don't know that young lady.

Oh, yes.

Her skin suffocated to death.

Yes, she's dead now.

You're supposed to leave a patch of skin.

That's right.

Yes.

And a lot of people don't know when they're watching that movie Goldfinger.

Is that what it was called?

Yes, it was a goldfinger.

When they're watching Goldfinger, it's a snuff film because that woman dies right on camera.

It's technically a snuff film, yes.

And it did win an award of the snuffies.

I know what he showed up to collect, obviously.

The Snuffleupagus?

Does he host that every year?

They have...

They've made their own Snuffleupagus-like creature.

Oh, like creature.

So they don't get sued.

What kind of creature is it?

I don't know if I were tasked with making a Snuffleupagus-like creature.

I don't know that I could do it because he's akin to an elephant.

Is he not?

Well, I think to a woolly mammoth.

True, but no tusks.

None taken.

Thank you very much.

So who's to say though that Snuffleupagus did have tusks at one point, but when he moved to the city that he lost the kind of fight?

Maybe they cut them off and sold them for the ivory.

Maybe ivory poachers came and he was taking a nap.

And it's really a shame because they probably did a special episode of SMA Street and they didn't talk about it.

You say SMA Street?

I guess I do.

I didn't realize that.

Well, most people say Sesame Street.

And in fact, they...

That's what I thought I was saying.

In the theme song they say it.

♪♪ Come and play.

Come and play.

♪ Come and play.

♪♪ ♪ Wasting the day away.

♪♪ That's by the way.

If you're already wasting the day away, you're having fun.

Why do you need to go down to Sesame Street?

Well, because you...

Because if you're wasting the day away, maybe you're not being like, pfft.

Being like, play is constructive.

It is constructive, but I would think that it would be a better theme song if it was like, you've had a hard day or come and play.

You've had a hard day.

You're on a go.

Down to Sesame Street.

Take me to Sesame Street.

Oh, Gozer.

Gozer, who are you saying?

Paul Gozer?

Who are you thinking of?

Oh, I'm thinking of the Ghostbusters.

You're thinking of Hosier.

Hosier.

Yes.

Cause, yay.

Wait, you think a Ghostbusters guy was Gozer?

Oh, that's right.

Gozer, the Keymaster.

The Keymaster.

Do you like that movie?

I love it.

What do you like about it?

Well, I love horror movies.

And I remember seeing that movie and just be...

You know, people...

I like to go to the movies to be, to feel.

And also to see things and to hear things.

Well, that's where you're...

Do you only go to the 4D movies where they speak for a few...

I wear a night mask and I put on headphones like the kind you can use at the airport.

Oh, I see.

Okay.

To guide planes.

So I just feel things.

Are you guiding planes while you're watching movies or...

Yeah, sometimes in my mind if the movie's boring.

And they were gone where you tried to guide them too.

Well, in my mind, yeah, sure.

Okay.

100% success rate.

But you ever look at the paper the next day and go, oh, this plane ended up there.

You know, in the...

In the where the planes ended up...

Why won't they print that?

I won't say print that.

You know, they have a bridge of game in there.

Why...

Why do they have horoscopes?

Horoscopes.

Tell us where the planes ended up the next day.

Horoscopes are not for real.

Yeah, and the planes are real as far as what we know.

As far as I know.

That's right.

But you know what?

They could be talking about...

Since they won't print in the newspaper, they could be talking about these planes doing who knows what and we wouldn't know.

We're not keeping track of every plane.

We have no idea.

And I want a printed record of these.

When Southwest had all those problems.

Yeah.

I was like, is that true?

Did that really happen?

We don't know.

Yeah.

Because I didn't know anyone personally affected by it.

No.

So I thought I bet it didn't happen.

No.

I...

It's all second-hand information.

Exactly.

You know, I don't think anyone has ever met...

It's all second-hand news.

Scram and play.

You had a hard day.

Don't you way about one-third-y-fans!

Oh, we had different lyrics.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

I thought the person that...

I was a smaller child, I think, than you.

Right.

I was a 35-pound.

When I was five years old, I was 135 pounds.

Yeah, that's stupid.

Yeah, I was a big boy.

And now, how much are you running?

I shopped in the Husky section.

Yeah.

How much are you running now?

Well, 36.

So you gained one pound from five years old to now.

Yeah.

I really...

I just stretched out.

I'm 6'2".

135 pounds.

Yeah.

That's too stretched, I think.

You think so?

Yeah.

I mean, you are rail things.

You look like Slender Man.

Well, I get that a lot.

Do you even really?

I shouldn't wear the stocking over my face.

You also look like the Baba Duke because you have a top hat as well.

Baba Baba Duke.

Baba Baba.

Baba Baba Duke.

You're a boob.

Baba Baba.

Oh, you think he's a mook?

Can we say that these days?

Baba Duke.

Baba Duke is a mook.

So, wait, where were we in the song?

I'm in play.

Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?

Yeah, see, I think there's things that's me.

I think I'm saying it too, but I guess I'm not.

No, you're not.

You know, a lot of people don't realize that the vowel choices that they have when they are dependent upon the region that they grow up in.

Where did you grow up?

How come the vowels don't thank you when they know you have a lot of choices?

We know you have a lot of choices when it comes to vowels.

Thank you for going with...

Ah.

Thank you for going with schwa.

Oh, schwa.

Schwa.

Where are you from?

I'm from here in Los Angeles.

Here in Los Angeles.

Yes, I go.

I'm an Angelina.

So, you have a podcast that is a...

I co-host a podcast.

You co-host a podcast.

Now, what is the difference between hosting a podcast with someone else and co-hosting?

Well, I would say that hosting a podcast means you get to talk more and you get to just, you know, say whatever you want and then you leave a space for the co-host to either agree or disagree, but they should agree.

Right.

So, is that what you do?

That's right.

After every single sentence, you say, I agree.

Yes, exactly.

Okay.

And this is false crime.

Yes.

You know, there's true crime.

Yes, true crime.

All these podcasts about...

Because there are...

There are...

There are fictional crimes, which you see on CSI and CIS.

You know, other shows with C in them.

In CSI.

So, CSI is crime scene investigation.

So, NCIS is new crime investigation scene.

Crime investigation scene.

That's strange, isn't it?

New crimes.

They only investigate new crimes.

That's strange.

I mean, and then the flip side of that is cold cases where they're just in...

In vitro?

In vitro.

In vitro crimes.

I bet it's cold in vitro.

IBC.

I wasn't born in vitro, but I bet it's freezing cold.

Oh my God.

To be in a tube?

Have you ever been in a tube?

I went water sliding once I was in one.

Then I went...

I bet it was...

It was a hot day.

You call it water sliding.

I went water sliding.

Yeah, what would you call it?

I went to a water park.

There's not that much to do there.

Could be it.

I could have eaten and left.

People get the idea.

What if they had a great hot dog at that water park and you were like, I'd just come for the hot dogs.

It cost me $50.

Plus the cars of the hot dog.

They should give you free hot dogs at water parks.

Should they not?

Yes, I think certainly any place where you're wearing the least amount of clothing that should give you the most amount of food for free.

Because you're more likely to turn it down.

If there was a water park that said, come eat whatever you want while you're here, no problem.

But you're wearing...

You're not wearing your shirt.

So you're more likely to say, oh no, I'm good.

Don't worry about it.

I can't think of anything that would go better with a water park than a buffet.

I'm not saying it's a buffet.

I am.

Oh, you are.

Yes.

Like you're thinking of trays with sterno.

I think of hot trays with sterno.

I'm thinking of smart cate or weightless behind everything.

They don't sing or a derve?

No, they don't do anything except point.

You point at the food and say, what is this?

And then they say what it is.

They say what it is, yes.

Oh, these are mashed potatoes with...

They say with their hands behind their backs, but they're wearing the tuxedo shirts and the tuxedo ties.

Why are the hands behind the backs?

And the tuxedo pants and the tuxedo shoes.

Because the tuxedo socks.

No, they can wear whatever socks they want.

Whatever socks they want.

This is a good time to do an ad for Bombas.

Bombas.

Isn't that a sock?

I hope so.

I really hope so.

I set the word bomb in it.

I know.

It's weird, isn't it?

Because bombs traditionally over the years from the Oklahoma City bombing to the rest.

They've been not good for the country and yet this is a sock company and they're not a sponsor so I feel like it.

But they should be, right?

Hey, Bombas, come talk to us because we'll talk about how you have the word bomb in your name.

I guess it's okay for socks because bombs don't really affect the feet.

Although there were a lot of our brave arm service people have gotten their feet blown off and they can't wear the bombas.

I don't think it's that their feet were blown off.

I think it's that their bodies were blown off of their feet.

Oh, so the feet stay where they're at.

The feet stay where they're at.

Okay.

So this is false crime though.

Yes.

And what is that?

Yes.

Basically, we tell a story like it's a true crime, but it didn't happen.

Okay.

Do you make it up as you go along or this is free?

My host makes it up as we go along.

Oh, okay.

So this is like the dollop where they're making up stuff about history and pretending it's real.

Oh, I thought they were just reading Wikipedia.

I think it was a different.

Oh, the two different jokes maybe.

So you're not reading Wikipedia about a crime that happened.

This is just fake crimes.

Why would anyone's crimes?

Why would anyone pardon my French?

Listen to this shit.

Well, they don't by large.

They don't.

We have very few listeners.

I'm one.

Oh, good.

And of course the host.

Are you just listening for the editing points though?

Yeah, I have to edit the thing.

But there's not a lot to edit.

There's not a lot of fat on it.

Yeah.

We really discuss these crimes in depth and our feelings about them.

Have you had that brown surgery that a lot of podcasters are having where they...

They ask the doctor to poke the part in their brain where they say, um...

And so you never say, um, again.

Is that a real surgery?

Yeah.

Surgery.

I've never had a surgery in my life.

You say sugar ray, that band with Mark McGillory.

Every morning when I wake up and I see the bed that my girlfriend is not then now.

She's just, she's dead.

I thought it was every morning when I wake up and I see the bed.

I check to see if my girlfriend's dead.

Oh, cause if she was dead, fictionally we could put it on the whole crimes.

Yes, murder was...

Murder was wrote.

I think that's what I said.

You really should, Jack, if you're here to do an action.

I'm, of course, I'm not allowed to say the title.

You're not really on the show.

That's the host of the...

That's the bailiwick of the host, the purview, the privilege of the host.

I see.

So who's your host?

Who is this gentleman who...

Fred Oldge.

And has he been doing this show for a long time and you just got on or...

He did one episode without me and then realized I need someone to bounce stuff off of.

And so he brought me in.

Interesting.

That's very, very interesting.

I really want to hear this show, but you say no one is listening.

Would you like to hear a clip?

Yeah, I'd love to.

I brought a clip if you'd like to play it.

Okay, great.

All right, here is me and...

Fred.

The host, Fred Oldge.

And murder was wrote.

Okay, here we go.

This is a clip from Murder Was Rope.

Here we're discussing a crime from 1979 that did not happen.

Wow.

This is crazy.

And so everyone was screaming when they saw it.

Oh, they are yelling and screaming blood everywhere?

Everywhere, even in the sink.

Even in the sink in the bathtub.

If you open the fridge, was there blood in there?

There was blood in the fridge and there's a pot of soup in the fridge that's blood in there.

Oh, no.

It got through the pot lid.

Through the pot lid in the white bean kale soup.

Yeah.

Blood everywhere.

It was more like blood soup.

This must have been in all the newspapers.

It was in every newspaper, New York Times, People Magazine, the neighborhood patch.

The neighborhood patch?

Yes, you know, the prestigious neighborhood patch.

Yes, we've talked about it before.

I know.

How is your wife doing?

She's finally conscious.

Oh, do you own your own headiest conscious?

Yes.

Oh, that's going to be trouble for you.

Well, she's going to be very mad when she fights out with it.

I know because she's the only one who has the coat to the home surveillance.

Yes, exactly.

Yeah.

And I guess I understood her reasons at the time for not sharing it with me.

Right.

But I wish that she had because it would have saved a lot of bother.

Right.

But when she wakes up, are you going to kiss her and hug her?

I probably will give her a warm and brass and I'll probably smooch her.

OK.

You're there.

OK.

And maybe some butterfly kisses.

Butter butterfly kisses.

That's where you grab a butterfly.

If you go to the zoo, sometimes they have a butterfly enclosure where you can walk around and there's butterflies in there.

Oh, OK.

Just grab one.

Oh.

And then you do like the butterfly's head or the cheek is eight.

And by that point, is the butterfly dead?

Yes.

All right.

There is blood everywhere.

Interesting.

Wow.

What an interesting clip.

Where's your co-host Fred Oldie from?

You know, he won't tell me.

Yeah, I think that's several times.

Yeah.

I've asked him several times.

I think that's a good idea.

And he says, here's what he does.

He says, that's none of your concern.

Yeah.

And I have to agree it is.

It probably is not a concern.

Yeah.

What?

I mean, people are from everywhere.

So why should it be?

Yes.

What an interesting show.

It seems like he was just kind of agreeing with you.

More.

That was a very special episode where we did an opposite day episode where I used to talk to them.

Well, I'm, you know, I guess I'm a little.

Let's hear one more clip from a different episode.

All right.

Wow.

There is blood everywhere.

Oh my God.

Yeah.

That's wild.

Somebody had to have died.

Somebody had to have died, right?

You can see it that way for sure.

All these blood, does it seem that way or is it for sure?

Well, you tell me.

Now we are in conflict.

Oh, no.

I don't want to have conflict with you, Fred.

Well, we have a big problem because you say it seems that way for sure.

Well, does it seem that way or is it for sure?

I'm holding you to account.

It for sure seems that way.

Okay.

That's different.

All right.

Man, this is a lot of blood.

You think it's one body or two bodies?

Who could say?

I mean a doctor.

Oh, sure.

Maybe we should get a doctor.

You should.

Hi.

Okay.

Oh, there.

Yes.

I heard someone, I was rushing through the podcast studio and I heard maybe we should get a doctor and I'm a doctor.

Is there an emergency in here?

Did you bring that microphone?

Yes.

I have it.

I'm a podcast doctor.

So I have my microphone.

Oh, why do you have this death scope taped to your chest?

It's not that way.

Because it's hooked up to the microphone and I want to make sure that all of our listeners can hear up my heart beating all the time.

Is there an emergency in here?

Well, kind of.

Is it an emergency if somebody already died?

You can't really do it that way.

Hmm.

Yes.

Your language is so confusing to me.

Wait, are you a co-host?

I'm just a co-host.

Oh, that's why you're nuts.

That's right.

Oh, I'm actually having a bit of conflict because...

Well, I'm also a therapist.

When I said I was a doctor, I meant I was a therapist.

Okay.

Well, you said you were a doctor, you were also a therapist.

So you're a psychiatrist.

I'm a psychiatrist.

Okay, but okay.

I'm not a psychologist.

So just pills.

He has a psychologist.

Yeah.

Do you guys need a subscription?

Subscription.

I would like some subscription.

No, I mean to people magazine.

I'll leave.

Okay.

Oh, that's like a pill in a way.

It makes me calm.

I made my vision board.

I'm selling people magazine.

It makes you what?

Make me calm.

Oh, calm.

Yeah, what do you think I say?

What do you think?

No, see, now we're having conflict.

Are you going to buy a people magazine subscription or not?

Yes.

Subscription or prescription?

I have subscriptions to people magazine.

Okay, and would you have prescriptions or anything?

I have no prescriptions.

I'm sorry.

I'm not licensed.

We have no...

Okay.

But does anyone need these?

I hate to see you so much.

Wait, you aren't psychologists, but you're not licensed?

No, I'm not licensed.

No, I'm so sorry.

You took an Uber here.

I took an Uber here.

Did you know that the first celebrity on People Magazine was me a pharaoh?

Yes.

I'm the first cover.

You do know that?

Well, I have it framed in my office.

Oh, you do?

Why?

Why do you?

I have to see.

What's the first cover of People Magazine?

You told me that was your wife.

We have no trust between us.

Okay.

Are you married to be a pharaoh?

No, I wish.

Don't let my wife hear that.

Cut this part out.

Okay, your wife.

Your wife wants you to go back to your podcast.

I'm not editing your podcast.

What do you know?

Hey, we do have a psychological question.

We do.

Hit me.

Okay, baby, one more time.

I like your style.

You like my style?

I just got this from TJ Maxx.

Yeah.

Really enjoy it.

That's what I'm saying.

Thank you.

The tags are still on, by the way.

It's like a turtleneck, but not quite.

They call it a mock neck.

Yeah.

Fred is quite the clothes horse.

Are you returning that after the day is over?

Because the tags are still hanging from me.

Yes, please.

I am.

But you don't have to.

I don't need to do this.

But on the errands, you have an Uber.

I have the Uber.

You're right.

You were waiting for you.

Yes.

Okay.

Here's a question.

So, I'm sorry.

Yes.

So you took the Uber here.

You said, keep it running.

Keep it running.

And then you came in here.

You had to walk around and see if anyone needs this.

Oh, so you were actually seeking out people like us?

Yes, exactly.

What kind of people when you say people like us?

Yeah.

What do you mean by this?

I don't know about you.

But I mean white people for you.

Interesting.

What do you mean I'm white?

Okay.

Why is the driven snow?

White as the dreaming snow.

Okay.

Yes.

Is this psychological question?

Yes.

Bit of a psychological trailer.

Okay.

All right.

I'm hooked already.

It's like Michael Jackson on pills.

I don't know.

Psychological pills.

Okay.

It's a lot of blood in here.

How many people do you think died?

There's a lot of blood in here.

Do you think it's A?

One.

B.

Two.

Do you mean is the blood type?

That's from Japarit.

What is the blood type?

What is the blood type for?

The blood type is all positive.

Oh, positive.

And that's not a choice.

I don't know if you're allowed to ask all of these questions or...

You could do that on Jeopardy.

Just ask follow up questions.

Yeah.

No one does it.

But you can do it.

Okay.

Well, then, yeah.

Ken Jennings is cool, man.

He's a cool guy.

I'm going to say A.

One person.

Well, what do you think, Fred?

Well, we were trying to think.

We for sure think it was at least one.

At least one.

That's what I know.

As a psychologist, you're saying, as a psychiatrist who is not a lot of prescribed pills, you're saying it was one person left all that blood.

One person left all that blood.

Okay.

I like your voice how it changed when you're yes, sir.

Why doesn't that all that blood?

It could be a chillin to me.

It's chilling, but it could be a chillin.

It could be a good song for like Coachella.

For good.

Our songs just played it Coachella.

Some songs are extra Coachella exclusives.

Yes.

Oh, interesting.

That clip.

You can go to a tent where all the bands will go to play a song.

Oh, you still okay?

Wait, the clip is still going.

No, no, no, I'm explaining to you what it was.

Wait, but.

No, I'm going.

While we were playing that clip, suddenly Fred walked in.

I'm going home.

I know you didn't want me here.

This was your thing.

We don't have to share everything.

I get it.

I'm out.

Hi, this is Fred Oldge.

And that's the clip.

Now you notice we took some of your voice and put it in my voice.

We just we recorded.

We your guy who called the other day and asked me all those questions.

Yes.

I wasn't doing a survey.

I remembered you as a bit of subject.

I remembered answering them that way.

Wow.

What an incredible podcast.

Thank you.

This seems like.

Thank you.

And where can people get it?

Right now it's just on the computer.

Oh, you haven't uploaded it to the internet yet or.

Isn't the computer the internet?

The computer is attached to the internet a lot of times.

Wireless Lee sometimes even.

Okay.

When I open the computer, I'm opening the internet.

Is that correct?

I mean, a lot of times when you open your computer, it will then attach to Wi-Fi, which is the internet.

Yes.

It's the.

Okay.

You know the pathway to porn.

Oh, pornography.

Oh, I.

Bye.

But you know, but okay.

So it is on the it is on the internet.

It is.

Yes.

Yeah.

That's when I met by on the computer because I think of the computers.

You know, you need to go to a site that that broadcasts it to the internet and then and then people will be able to pick it up.

Your eyes are darting back and forth like you're in a cartoon right now.

I don't know.

I've uploaded it.

Also, your eyes have just turned into dollar signs.

Yes.

I'm going to be one people get curious.

Wow.

I'm going to be in the money.

And then now three jackpots came up.

That's right.

Oh, wow.

I'm sorry.

I'm wearing a mask.

You're wearing a mask.

This is what I really look like.

Oh, oh, I was drawing my one arm bandit mask, which looks like a human head.

It looks like a human head and now you've taken off the mask and it looks like that Mike Myers Halloween mask straight.

Yes.

I was in an accident.

Oh, what type?

A car.

And I went through the windshield of my car and the other car.

Two windshields?

Who windshields?

No, waiting.

And when they saw my, I remember the paramedics said when they saw my face, they went gross.

Did they say anything like to the effect of butter face or true ago?

No, I mean, I mean, I think gross kind of summed it up.

Like all those things were talking about them there.

Do you think they were talking about them there?

No, one of the paramedics told me later specifically it was that my face looked gross because it went through two windshield.

I see.

Okay.

They weren't just judging you at like aesthetically.

Well, they were judging me aesthetically.

But I mean, not pre accident.

Right.

Pre accident, I was very handsome.

Would you like to see a picture?

Yeah, I'd love to take a look.

Oh my God.

Yeah.

This is like something out of a catalog.

That's right.

I mean, well, it is.

I was in a, I was a catalog model.

You were a catalog model for a catalog for all of them.

Every single catalog?

Sears, JCPenney, Tiffany and company.

Wow.

Okay.

Well, that's a leap right there.

Orvus.

What about Ikea?

Yes.

They have a thick one, don't they?

Oh, they get a thick one.

All right.

Ikea?

Yes.

I can.

We need to take a break because I'm getting a little hotter under the collar here.

Why are you angry?

No, no, getting a little steamy in here talking about Ikea's.

Why are you angry?

What's about anger or is it about sex?

I think it can be about both.

You could be angry during sex as well, can you?

I found a hotter than the collar meant angry.

Well, you can be angry during sex and to ask my wife.

By the way, what's going on with your wife?

She's conscious now.

She's finally conscious and she is angry with someone and that someone is me.

Oh, no.

Okay.

I'm so sorry.

She didn't give me the door code.

So you're a two accident couple.

Yes, we are.

One for you, one for her.

It's the Scorsese style.

That's exactly right.

Ow.

All right.

So Ted Newgy is here.

It's fascinating to talk to you.

It's fascinating to be talked to by you.

We also have a dancer coming up after the break.

Do you enjoy the arts?

I love to watch a Dinsaire.

I love to watch an Ector.

I love to watch a Sanger.

Sanger.

When they're up there singing their songs, I love a Sanger.

Okay.

Well, we have a dancer coming up and this is exciting.

We also have a concerned citizen coming up a little later.

This is a great show.

I'm glad you're here with me.

Do you have any posts?

Poats?

Poem?

Poats?

We have no poets on the show today.

I'm so sorry.

But you are a co-host.

You're a professor.

I would love for you to be my co-host here today.

Oh my gosh.

Well, this is...

I accept.

Okay.

Great.

A deal is struck.

When we come back, we're going to have a dancer.

Let's shake on it.

Why did you spit in my face right then?

Isn't that the way it started?

No, but it should be.

I mean, first it's gross already to do it in your hands.

I thought it was gross.

Yeah.

When we have a co-host here, we cut our hands and do a blood brother's shake.

That seems unsanitary.

Here we go.

Oh.

I'm not doing that.

Oh God.

This is a terrible paper cut.

You should not have done that.

Oh my God.

I'm losing a lot of blood right now.

It's from a paper cut.

From a paper cut.

Well, I did it with an entire book.

We'll be right back.

Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

Comedy bang bang, we're back.

This is Scott Ockerman of course, and I have a new co-host on the show.

Nougie is here.

Hi everyone.

Great to be here.

I'm the co-host and Scott is the host.

That's right.

You have your style already down.

I love it.

Will you be here every episode do you think from now on or?

I probably will be.

Okay, great.

Wouldn't mind it.

14 years in.

Well, I mean almost 14.

14 really?

Yeah, that's how long we've been doing it.

Oh my gosh.

I'm like, God.

I'm Fred Olge.

We've only been doing ours for 11 years.

You've been doing it 11 years and haven't uploaded a single episode?

No, I never said that.

Has anyone ever heard them?

No.

You've not up.

Yeah, you need to upload these.

I'll teach you how after the show.

Okay, well you were the one that said, why would anyone listen to this shit?

That's a good point.

So you made me think that no one heard, no one listened because they didn't want to listen.

That's a great point.

Let's go to another clip.

Okay.

Right, Fred.

Okay.

This is a lot of blood.

And the year is 1982.

Okay.

It is.

It's 1982.

We are about eight years from 1990.

That's a fact.

And what exactly happened here?

Well, somebody or somebody's died.

And it's not a good thing.

Somebody's going to go to jail.

I hope so.

I hope so too.

But you think it was a murder?

I think it was a murder.

It was a really hard fistfight.

I got a positive right here.

Did your co-host mean a difficult fistfight or the fists were hard or?

I just read to mean that the fistfight was so they were fighting so hard that they murdered each other.

So a simultaneous fistfight.

That's how I took it to be.

Okay, let's hear it.

It was a simultaneous fistfight.

Well, let's hear it.

The fistfight was so hard that they murdered each other.

I'm going to pause right here.

Your co-host answered my question.

I shouldn't have paused.

That's okay.

I didn't want to give anything away.

So that's why I said I took it to mean that.

Yeah.

But I wanted you to be surprised.

Next time I'll be a little less heavy on the pause button and let the clip play out.

So we'll listen to some more clips?

We will.

Okay, great.

Oh, is that one done?

Yeah, that one's done.

Oh, okay.

Weird clips.

Okay.

All right, great.

Well, and these are that by the way, that was all fake.

That's all the blood and everything.

All the, yeah, none of these all things happen.

None of these are from time.

Okay.

And you can see we get really in time.

Fred seems very confused about what's going on the entire time.

Well, that's his prerogative.

He's the host.

Yeah, that's the way he wants to live.

All right, let's bring in our next guest.

Come here a little later.

We have a concerned citizen, but before we get to them, let's get to our next guest.

She's a dancer.

Please welcome Stormy Kirkland.

Hi.

Hello, Mr. Altcom.

Could you have done that before we started recording?

By the way, I tried.

You tried?

I tried.

How did you try?

Like, because you clearly did it right when I introduced you.

Did you do a little before?

I tried to do it quietly.

I tried to.

That was not quite.

Well, that's you trying to do it quiet.

Well, that's me trying to do it for real.

That's what that was.

For real.

Well, because before I tried to do it quietly, have you ever tried to clear your throat quietly?

Let's see if we can do it.

Here we go.

Here, Ted, I want you to.

Ted.

With actual clearing of the Flem, let's try to do it as quite as possible.

All right.

Let me get some Flem in there first.

Let me get some Flem in there.

Do you mind?

I've got some extra.

I've got extra.

Can I get some of your stuff?

Yeah, I've got some here.

I've got some here.

A little clip for you.

Okay.

Here we go.

Ready?

Too good for my Flem.

As quiet as you can, but actually clear it.

Like you're choking on.

Okay.

I thought we were doing it in the time of days.

Why we can't tell which is the quietest.

Okay.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, go ahead.

Oh.

Oh, I get that a lot.

You do.

Really?

Yes.

My wife.

My wife is married to Borat.

It's so confusing.

Who is Borat a woman?

Why does Borat have to be a woman to be married to me?

But you said your wife and I think normally when people hear wife they think of a woman.

Why?

Wife is too gendered.

Husband.

I agree.

We need to get rid of these words.

It should be wife and woman.

We need to cancel wife and husband.

Okay.

And then do what do you call your partner?

If they're just your partner?

You said it or we call them.

Too confusing.

I can't put people in a box if they're everyone's calling.

Are you going to try to clear your throat here?

Yes.

Oh.

Was that it?

That's the golem.

No, no, no, no.

I don't know anything about that.

But you don't know anything about golem?

What is there to know?

What is that?

A city.

He lives in a cave.

He wants a ring.

I thought it was a city in Ireland.

I don't know.

Okay.

Are you here to talk to me about who I am?

Why do what my deal is or what?

I do want to know what your deal is and I want to know how long you've been doing it.

Okay.

Very rude.

You haven't given me a fair shot.

Okay.

Talk to me.

You're a dancer.

I do know that.

I am a ballet dancer.

I'm a ballet dancer.

You're a ballet dancer.

Valé dancer.

What is that?

Someone who dances in the valé.

In the valley?

Do you mean is that just your accent?

In the valley?

Yes.

The San Fernando Valley?

Also the valé at the moment.

Where Encino Man is said?

Encino Man.

Yes.

I've seen that film.

Have you really?

I have not seen it.

John Lennon is.

I do have no John Lennon.

I do not have no John Lennon.

You know who he is or you know him?

I do not know.

So what song is he ever written?

Hip hop.

Happy to the hop.

You don't know him.

He was ever written.

He was in the Beatles.

He wasn't the Beatles.

So you knew it.

You knew it.

Okay.

Well you know of him then.

Well yeah I know.

Have a memory of him.

I'm sorry.

I didn't hear exactly what you said.

You are sorry.

Sure.

I receive it.

It's a valé in the valé.

So the when you say the valé do you mean the person who takes your car when you go to a restaurant that doesn't have any parking?

Well that's a valé person.

The valé is just the area.

So you dance in the valé area.

People are waiting for their car.

The people are waiting for the car.

I'm valé dancing.

And then she's doing her dancing.

It's a little like busking perhaps.

What's busking?

Yeah.

Performing on the street for money.

It's when you pretend to be a king at the bus.

Oh I don't get paid.

No I don't do this for money.

I don't do it for money.

A king of the bus stop.

I'm sorry.

The king of the bus stop.

No no no buses.

These people have cars.

They're not trash.

Well busking is something that I used to do when I was younger.

Busking.

I would wear a crown.

Okay on the bus.

They never let me on the bus but I would be at the bus station.

Why would they never let you on the bus?

Not even one time.

I think they thought I had projects.

Oh so someone shows up wearing a crad.

Did you have a scepter in a cave?

Of course I did.

I was a king.

But I knew I wasn't a king.

It's not like I was delusional.

But I would stand there at the bus station and when they would say the bus is ready they make the announcement everything.

The bus is ready.

You are so a buss.

Ladies and gentlemen we have a special announcement.

The bus is ready.

I'm sorry I was going to comment on your body.

And then I would raise my scepter high and I would say good people.

I welcome you to the bus.

And then the bus driver would say not today.

Not today.

So I would let them.

Yeah I was also.

I was a devil.

I was a devil with a crown.

A crown with horns?

A devil horn?

Yes.

I'm not a crown of thorns.

A crown of horns.

And that's probably what they wouldn't let me on the bus.

I would let everybody else get on first and then I would say and I will join you.

And then the bus driver would say uh uh.

I wonder if he or she.

Or they.

Was more worried about the crown stuff or the devil stuff.

Oh I would imagine.

Every bus driver is a Christian.

I know this.

Is that true?

Yes.

They all have Bibles.

Statistically.

Really.

Statistically.

Statistically they're all Christians.

They're all Christians.

I have to get questions.

I know a lot of people who I mean I know a lot of drivers.

I'm doing sleep.

Right.

Sure because I'm a valid answer.

Yeah so I do.

What about mini?

Do people have a vali park buses?

Do people sometimes?

Yes.

They do vali park buses.

So not all vali people are able to.

So like someone is taking a party bus to a restaurant.

In the val?

Yeah.

Normally anytime that's happened to me in Vegas or whatever.

Sure.

They say the driver goes okay everyone get off I'm going to drive around and let me know when to come back.

But if you're good people you let the driver show in your party.

You're riding the bus.

You're looking at me with disbelief in your eyes.

So you can read facial expressions.

I can.

I didn't say I didn't say.

Interesting.

I didn't say.

Do another one.

No.

Give me another facial expression and that one is disgusting.

You're disgusting or disgusting?

Your face is disgusting.

Sorry.

Like you were trying to do a Robert De Niro impression.

Sorry.

Yeah.

Okay.

Oh no.

It's like Robert De Niro's lost his teeth.

Can you milk me?

Oh my gosh.

His most famous quote.

I hope that that just takes over you talking to me at some point where that's anytime anyone does a De Niro that's what they say from now on.

Look at this.

Can you milk me?

Yeah.

I'm going to do a little bit of a video.

I'm going to do a video.

Is that for real?

That's what it's called.

That's by Wakeliffe John Lennon.

Part of the series is Fuck Mary Kill because when...

Fuck Mary Kill, Live Die Repeat.

Very similar.

Yes.

Out of the three of us, Live Die Repeat.

Okay.

I'm going to say die to Scott right off the bat.

Oh, please.

I hate to hear that.

Terrible.

I'm going to say live to Ricky Johnson.

Wow.

Okay.

That means Ted.

You're going to repeat.

No.

Okay.

Well, actually I would like to switch.

If I could switch, that would be great because I...

Yeah.

What's going on?

I need to go back.

You need to go back to the old day?

I need to go back to the lupid.

What happened?

How did you get out of the lupid?

What happened?

How did you get out of the lupid?

I also have to say that when you said switch, it reminded me of a famous dance we used to do Back of the Valet.

What was it?

It's when you...

I got to hear about this dance.

Okay.

It's when...

You're going to waste part of your day?

No.

This day's...

No.

Once it gets back in the lup, I'll have plenty of time.

Okay.

So you haven't lived this day over and over?

This is...

No, this is a brand new to you.

Everything is new to you.

I've been living days and this is my exact...

Everything is like a repeat on NBC that you haven't seen.

New to you.

It's new to me.

That's right.

New to you.

Okay.

All right.

So the switch is your foot... your right foot is in one place.

And then you hop your left foot to the place, your right foot, it was in.

And then switch and make a switch.

And then you make a switch again.

And you do that on beat.

That is the dance.

It's a gorgeous dance.

It's less involved than I thought, but all right.

What do you want more?

I can give you more.

What's the dance where you twist your hips around?

That's called the twist your hips around.

What's the dance where you hop to the left and you put your knees in tight?

Then I know there's a pelvic thrust.

That's the Texas chainsaw.

Thank you.

Oh.

What's the one where I put my hand upon my hip and when I dip, you dip, you do.

You dip.

I dip.

We dip.

That one is called the community dip.

The community dip.

What's the one dance where you cha cha real smooth?

That one is called a cha cha walk.

Cha cha walk.

Okay.

W-O-K.

Oh.

Because it's like a little bit of eastern flavor in my life.

A little bit of...

Monika.

Monika in Maya and...

And the Martin Brandi.

When they say little Monica, how much are we talking?

A little Monica?

Well, she's probably about five or four.

Don't ask Bill Clinton.

Oh boy.

Have I ever seen him?

That's the first thing I'm going to ask him.

I have to see him.

Tricky Bill.

Oh my gosh.

I didn't...

I just wouldn't bring myself to Mars if you know what I mean.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well...

All right.

So tell us what happened.

How'd you get out of the loop?

It was, you know, I spent a lot of...

I spent 11 years in this loop and I wasn't...

11 of your years.

It was one day to us.

Exactly.

And so I wasn't doing a whole lot.

I didn't do the Groundhog Day thing where I learned piano over a series of however many years.

It is weird that his teacher is so proud of him because he's always on the line.

And he's only been taking it for one day.

Why would he even go back?

If he knew piano that, what did he learn that day from her?

Just exactly.

Did he learn the end of the composition?

He bothered me for a second.

Like, does he go to the piano teacher and say like, hi, I know every single thing to do with piano other than the end of this one song?

And she teaches me that.

I don't know one note.

And then why would she be so proud?

I don't know.

Anyway, go ahead.

You know, I sort of went on a journey.

I did so many things that I thought I would never do.

You know, yeah.

I sort of went on a journey with you.

Every one's journey is different.

Do everyone, you know, is that true?

I think so.

I think you wouldn't think what I considered a journey might be a journey to you.

Oh my God.

I agree.

Everyone's really on is the band of course.

Well, I wouldn't agree that the recent performance they gave was all that great.

Oh, no, I don't think so either.

Yeah.

And if the Arilago, the Marilago, it's like the Batman.

Journey.

Yeah.

Journey.

Smallette.

Marilago.

Yes.

Right.

Yeah.

Just don't tell her brother.

The winter White House.

He'll supposedly get beaten up there.

Yeah.

Who's your president say?

Like the president I grew up with?

Like your SNL cast.

What?

Who are your guys?

My president was Ronnie Reagan.

Oh, I loved Woodrow Wilson.

You mean them.

Tell us how I don't want to talk about these.

You want to talk about these?

Let's get back to the loop.

I was wandering in the middle of the desert one night and I saw but a golden idol and I was like this must go.

You saw but a golden idol?

Yeah, just a shimmering in the moonlight.

So you saw nothing else but a golden idol.

Yeah, that's right.

It was just me and I didn't.

And you had you been to the desert before during that 11 year.

I never mentioned over there.

You never went to the desert?

No.

Great thing about California you can go surfing in the morning and get the fish.

Skiing at night.

You don't even have to name your horses.

No.

Yeah.

So I enticed me to go over there.

I sort of got stuck in the loop of being like I got to name this horse.

I got to name this horse.

And then I realized it doesn't even name.

No.

And I got over there.

You got over there.

And here's what's great.

You can remember your own name because there ain't nobody for to give you no pain there.

And isn't that the truth?

Good point.

Sometimes you get hassled so much you forget your own name.

That's happened to me before.

I just get so everyone just hassling you so much.

It's like who am I?

Who even am I?

Yeah.

Somebody's calling your name.

You don't turn around because you've forgotten it.

I forgot.

And so I found this shimmering golden idol in the moonlight and I said this looks like it must fit into something.

And so then I do that with a lot of things.

This looks like it must fit into something.

Yeah.

And then I happened upon what I would call I guess a mysterious cave.

Oh, in the desert cave?

Yeah.

So mysterious cave in the desert.

In the very same desert?

In the very same desert.

It was almost a bit of a cave of wonders even.

There was a bunch of jewels.

It kind of presented itself before me out of the sand.

Wow.

Oh, it rose out of the sand.

It presented itself to you?

Because I had to settle on me.

How long from finding the shimmering idol to encountering the magical cave?

It was like 30 seconds.

It was not.

Whoa.

Okay.

So it's almost like it was triggered by you finding the idol in the sand.

Exactly.

Yeah.

Triggered.

I'm triggered by you finding the idol.

You finding the idol?

He's triggering me.

Yeah.

So it rises up.

You go inside.

There's a bunch of jewels.

A bunch of jewels.

I'm not tempted by these jewels.

Of course I was tempted.

I was salivating like a sick pig that I am.

Wait.

You're a sick pig?

What's your illness?

What is your illness?

I mean, I just, I, you're sick in the head.

I'm a, I'm a, I'm sick in the head.

I'm twisted.

I'm a bit julist.

Yeah.

Oh my.

When he came on here, he coughed.

He hacked a lugee so big.

He did.

Hmm.

That only God could lift it.

I had said something in my throat.

I'm a bit julist.

You're not a good dancer.

You injure yourself immediately.

Oh my gosh.

I've never been so disrespectful.

You're almost like Mr. Glass.

I am like that.

Did you see that movie on one of the days in the 11 years?

You were trapped in that?

I watched all three of the films in that series.

You know I had it unbreakable.

Split and Mr. Glass.

And I just had some new movies since you've been trapped.

A little thing called old.

Well that was the thing.

I saw old in the 11 years.

We talked about old last time.

The whole time in the last time I was a hot one.

Why does that happen?

I would have nightstand.

I love it.

I can't remember that.

I can't wait to see a knock at the cabin.

But I probably won't because the thing is I've got to get back to my loop.

Okay tell us what happened.

So you were granted the ability to get out of the loop?

Yes because in a wheel, a wheel of time emerged from the wall.

Not the wheel of time.

No.

I'm less interested in the mechanics of this and just like what happened.

See that's all I twisted.

I pushed the wheel.

It was like a big donkey wheel kind of and I pushed it and then I moved right away.

Or was it like you had to like really get your feet dug in and like push it without your body.

I was huffing and puffing.

It was embarrassing.

Because during the entire time was anyone there to see it?

Thank God no.

I mean I don't know if there was a candid camera in there or something but I would not.

What's candid camera?

Oh are you being punked by Ashton Koochah?

I hope Koochah wasn't involved.

Is it Koochah?

Koochah could even say.

At this point?

That was what you can tell us.

Koochah.

He should have a press conference.

I would like him to have a press conference.

Yes he definitely at this point.

At this point.

And I was so much his hand in the marketplace.

Over a Bible.

I need to be able to trust what he's saying.

And he should do it as his famous pop chips character.

And he should have made it.

Yes.

He's an Indian pop chips character.

That was right the day before we decided that was not okay anymore.

Yes.

Yeah yeah yeah.

And he'll release this statement exclusively on the blockchain.

So what happened?

I pushed the wheel and then I landed in and I was I found myself in another desert.

Fast forward.

Hold on a second.

Push out.

I'm pushing the wheel put you in another desert.

I was magically.

I was transported.

Oh I'm transported.

Yes.

Can you fast forward to the point where you got out of the loop?

Well guess what?

I walked over.

It was day time now.

I was like oh I guess the loop started over.

I look at a newspaper.

The next day.

Do you remember?

Obviously you remember what the day is.

I remember exactly the day.

So I'm not going to ask you.

I just want to.

Let's tear you no further.

Yeah.

After you saw the newspaper.

You must have been so excited.

Did you look in the mirror and say oh boy.

I didn't say oh boy.

I said oh no.

You said oh no.

Like our like the backyard areas cast phrase.

No no no.

I don't know what that is.

I think you were around during it.

But anyway.

I guess so yeah I think I might have said oh no.

Yeah.

I don't know if did I invent it?

I don't know.

That's probably something I could have.

That was something really good and smart that I said.

You can't just take credit for other people's things.

I said it because I'm saying it now.

But I was like okay I guess the loop's over.

So you went from oh no to okay.

Yeah it was sort of a short cycle and you can imagine those 30 seconds after that.

So the loop was over.

Had the day that you had been living your desert day?

Have you created a lot of wreckage in your personal life?

No and this is the thing we were sort of talking about last time was that it was like you know I had tried a bunch of different experiences because I knew my day would reset over and over again.

So I had killed.

I had killed myself.

I jumped in front of a bus.

I've done all sorts of crazy things.

I tried all the crack which is what I knew I had a taste for it.

Amazing.

Yes.

Did you ever eat poison?

I ate poison.

You know I threw a drink.

I drank it.

I injected it.

I smelled poison.

I snorted poison.

Did you pour it in your ear?

Shakespeare style?

I poured it into my ear.

I did it like a poison soaked tampon up my ass.

Don't you think you'd wake up if someone poured poison in your ear?

I would hope so.

I would hope I would like to eat poison.

What's that I hear?

Poison?

I hear a trickling.

Hark.

I hear a trickling.

So what had happened to you on the day?

Why do you need to get back and correct it?

What had happened was?

What had happened was I realized I hadn't made it in the loop.

You know my day would reset.

No harm, no foul.

Yeah.

Anytime I make an HNF.

Any HNF.

Now when I make a mistake, I gotta live with it.

There are consequences.

There's cancel culture now.

I know.

You didn't factor that in when you wanted to get out of the loop.

No, I didn't know that I could be canceled for any old thing.

Oh no, have you been canceled since then?

Not really.

No, who's really canceled?

You can kind of just wait it out for a little while.

Yeah, that's true.

That's a good one.

So what did you...

Unless you should need a con or...

Yeah.

Oh God, well what she did was unforgivable.

Well, she shaved her head and she did that.

It was the combo of the two.

That's true.

That's a recipe for disaster.

So when she shaved her head, that was strike one.

She was like, this is it.

She's got to do it.

She had more transfer.

She had a long beautiful locks.

Oh, she had luxurious curly hair.

What do you mean, you can't tear pictures of the Pope every single day and nobody blinks in eye, but if you do it with a shaved head, everyone loses a lot.

You can have one.

Jason, have one of them.

You can't have both.

Stay away from it.

Stay them?

Stay away from it.

Stay them away.

Stay them, take me away.

Stay them, stay them by yourself.

All right.

So what have you done then?

Have you just wrecked your life?

I mean, the other day, I crashed my car.

That was a...

Why did you do that?

Because I forgot that I wasn't in anymore and I hadn't done that in the loop.

Right.

And I was like, so I had sort of a phantom loop syndrome.

Phantom loop syndrome, yes.

You had PLS?

I have PLS where sometimes I forgot that I'm not in the loop because I usually wake up in my bed.

I'm going to do the PLS ice bucket challenge.

Yeah.

Let's do this.

The PLS ice bucket challenge.

I'm going to do it now.

So we put ice on ourselves or on other people?

You put as much ice in a bucket as you can.

As much ice as you can fit in any bucket and that's the challenge.

And then we count the more, the ice.

We count the cubes at the end.

And then people are aware of the disease and they say, oh.

Yeah.

That's a disease.

That exists.

You know what you should do is put as much ice as you think can go in a bucket.

Then we weigh today, it all melts and then we measure the water level and see who had the most ice.

So honestly, and I hope this time.

I'm going to do this watch because I think not all scientists watched before when people were doing the ice bucket challenge.

Yeah.

Scientists hated it before.

They hated it.

They don't like viral videos.

They don't hate videos.

No.

Have you ever seen a scientist drink a drink?

No ice.

They hate it.

They hate this.

They hate it.

It's like they're in Darn England or something like that.

Yeah.

Hey.

So sorry.

Wait, you're from the valley of it.

Oh no, you're from shore.

Shore ditch.

I'm from the valley in England.

Right, right, right.

I'd cast something you think will help you.

Well, no one else made that.

Sorry.

It's a question I say for the end.

Everyone will be asked.

How can we help you?

A crack kid who has numerous dance injuries.

You never said how can I help?

You know, I'm like the Wizard of Oz.

I can grant wishes.

Oh, fraud.

Yeah.

Okay.

So how do you want to get back to the loop?

I thought being here would be some sort of trigger, you know, for me and I'd get back into a loop because I spent a lot of my loop a lot of the 11 years I was in the loop, you know, talking with you, Darcy and the babysitter.

Oh, that's right.

The babysitter.

Yeah.

And we all just had we had a great time and I just thought maybe something here would, you know, trigger the loop again, but I.

But you can't be triggered.

Yeah.

I'm on triggerable, babe.

Do you think a cave will rise up again?

You should do a stand up special and call it that.

Yeah.

I want to stand up.

Wow.

You like that, Chacha?

I was typing, the comic book character Bane on my phone the other day and it corrected texting.

Amen.

Just texting that man.

There's a problem out there and Gotham.

You got to take it.

But have you heard this Bane guy?

He was born in the darkness, molded by it.

It auto corrected to babe like my phone's Dennis Miller or something.

What the hell is going on with this?

What is Bane's name was babe?

I don't think auto correct should should correct words.

Get that serum out of yourself babe.

Get that serum out of your self babe.

I am the darkness babe.

So what, what, yeah, it's not triggered a cave rising up or anything like that.

So I don't know.

Narying a cave around here.

I think you might be stuck.

I just, I need to go back and I just, I don't, I don't know what was there.

I had it great there.

You know, I didn't do a whole lot.

I haven't done a lot in the intervening times since I've been out of loop.

Yeah, you only went to the desert once.

That seems like, that's all it took too.

And isn't that something I could have done it day two.

Have you gone back to the desert where you were and like picked up the thing that triggered the cave and all that?

What?

Go back to the desert where all this magic should happen.

That seems like a no.

You didn't do that.

Can I ask you something?

The date go to me?

The date, the date.

Yes.

The, the day before you got stuck in the loop, did you go to that desert?

Yeah.

And did you get that jewel and trigger the cave and all that kind of stuff?

Yeah, let's see.

Well, for me, it was a little over 11 years ago.

I'm trying to remember.

Yeah, it seems like something I would have done.

I love, I love seeing a shimmering golden idol in the middle of the desert.

Yeah.

Right, right.

So you didn't go back there the very next day that you found out you were in a loop.

Well, I was just there, babe.

Go back to the, go back to the desert.

Stop bothering us.

You want, okay.

How am I supposed to get there on a, on a horse with a name, I assume?

You don't have a car.

You don't have someone who can drive you.

I wonder the streets, my dear.

I don't know what you want.

I don't have a car.

I have a job for letting you.

I have access to many cause.

I've got access.

Now this is interesting.

Oh, all of a sudden it's the cause.

Nothing else.

You can also take a desert bus.

Oh, a bus.

You think a bus would go over there.

I probably do a site.

There's, there's regular buses to the desert.

Yeah.

Just pull the, pull the string, you know, when you get to the.

Pull the string.

Well, I can't, I can't answer all of your questions, but the answers do not lie within me.

Unfortunately, I'm sorry, but it's a pleasure.

Members cannot lie.

Men lie.

Men lie all the time.

I lie to my wife constantly.

Why?

What's the deal with that?

She's been conscious.

And you'll say that we're just trying to tell her lies.

When she lies, you lie.

It's a community lie.

All right.

Look, we're running out of time here.

Please, please help me.

I'm so, I don't have anything to help you.

I'm so sorry.

We are running at a time.

We only have time for one final feature.

And that is, of course, a little something called plugs.

You give me some plugs, you little bitch.

I'll probably die.

And then you'll go to jail for not saving my life.

And then you'll start again and fight with others for their turf.

And then your gang will break out and conquer the whole earth.

And then the aliens come.

Rain hell from the sky.

Your earth turf is now ruined.

And let me tell you why.

They didn't give me plugs.

And now the earth was destroyed.

They didn't give me plugs.

They're floating in a void.

All right.

That was give me plugs or else.

Oh my God.

I've never been threatened in a plugs theme.

I liked it, though.

We had time for the length of that song, though, huh?

Not to help me, though?

Yeah, unfortunately.

I was by my best friend, Matt McNamara.

Oh.

Thank you to my best friend, Matt McNamara.

Oh, I thought it was possessive.

Matt McNamara.

Hey, have you been to Matt's McNamara?

Yeah, it's my favorite McNamara by far.

It's gone downhill, though.

No, literally.

Yeah, sorry.

Yeah, it slid down the hill.

Mudslides.

Mudslides, bro.

Who's this guy?

Mudslides, bro.

Yeah, mudslides, dude.

I want to keep it that way, bro.

All right.

So, we're going to have a plug in Ted Newgy.

What do you want to plug?

Obviously, you have a podcast out there.

Murder was wrote.

Yeah, murder was wrote with me and Fred Oldge.

And we cover all the false crimes that exist or that don't exist.

They don't exist.

They exist in your mind.

Yeah.

But that one about Angela Lansbury was too close.

It was too close.

Because she had died the night before.

She actually did die, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

I read it the paper that morning.

Oh.

I would like to give you the web address of a good website.

OK, make sure to put in the HTTP and whether the slashes are forward or backward.

I can't because it's been shortened in Libya.

What?

And it goes like this.

B-I-T dot L-Y slash P-F-T dash V-O-D.

That's all I can say.

That's all you want to say?

Oh my God.

I'm going to be there.

I'm going to go on it right after this show.

This is exciting.

Also, when does this come out?

I don't know.

OK, bye.

How about you stormy?

What do you want to plug here?

I would like to plug.

What is so funny?

I don't know.

I was thinking of something my wife once said.

Say it.

What'd she say?

She said, I'm leaving you.

You thought that was hilarious?

You reminiscing fondly?

It's got to be a practical joke.

Hilarious to you.

OK.

I would like to plug alcoholics anonymous.

Oh, like going to it or...

Sex and love addicts anonymous.

All of the things that will help people be sober because frankly, I don't want anyone using crack.

Yeah.

Do you have any favorite television programs or anything on Saturday evenings?

I don't watch TV much.

Really?

There's a Saturday evening, Sunday mornings?

I don't watch TV much now.

Much but you must.

I love...

I'd like to plug mad TV reboot, second season.

The next reboot?

No, no, no.

Wait, we're just rebooting the second season?

No, cut this part out.

Wait, I would like to do this over again.

They're going to bring the second season of that TV.

Who are the cast members on that particular season?

OK, wait.

I think Andy Daley was gone.

I want to do it again.

All right, here we go.

I would like to plug...

Oh, sobriety.

Sobriety.

I'd also like to plug Saturday Night Live.

Saturday Night Live, why?

Yeah, because, you know, it's quintessential American...

Oh, it's been on for almost 50 years.

Nearly 60 minutes.

How long has 60 minutes been on there?

60 minutes has been on for at least an hour.

Yeah, it's right there in the title.

Exactly.

Let's see if I can talk about 60 minutes versus Saturday Night Live.

60 minutes is an accurate title.

Well, not necessarily, because if you count commercials, it's probably less than 60 minutes.

If you count commercials?

If you count one, two, three, four, count the commercials.

If you count the commercials, it is 60 minutes.

If you count the commercials, if you count the commercials...

No, if you count...

How many were on last night?

Of all the shows I watched?

You have all the shows you watched.

120.

120, that's just 20 more...

Just 20 more...

Commerse with the arguments on Earth.

I used to, yeah.

But now because Steve-o doesn't exist, you just watch the commercials.

Yeah.

I don't know.

No, sir.

Just account.

So what?

If you count the amount of time commercials take in the program, this is not quite 60 minutes.

Right.

The program itself, the amount of programming.

No, if you don't count the commercials, it's like 45 minutes.

I'd also like to plug CBS Sunday Morning, which is a beautiful show that comes on in the mornings on CBS.

That is very accurate.

It always ends with a tranquil nature scene, and it begins with an ear-splitting trumpet.

I like that.

No, I'd like to plug some other programs.

Yeah, here we go.

Apple's Therapy on Showtime.

Absolutely.

Great show.

It's a reality TV program.

It's good.

It's reality TV.

What's that show on HBO?

Love is it called?

Love?

The show on Netflix called Love?

No, no, it's called something else.

Season two, it's about love life.

Love life.

I believe HBO has removed all their programming.

No.

But no, from...

Yes, that show, yes.

They removed that show.

Dream on.

That show...

Out everything.

They raised their prices by a dollar a month.

I don't know.

Was it one dollar a month?

One dollar.

It's a weird flex to take everything off your platform and then raise prices.

We have even less.

Give us more money.

Yes, I did.

And in the email they were like, so we can make more shit.

And it was like...

And take it off.

That's a YP.

I also like to plug Instagram.

Okay, just generally.

Just generally.

As an app.

Okay.

It's like a nice place to see.

I like to plug the internet.

Okay.

Well, I'll...

What up you and I say I like to plug this guy.

I like to plug Earth.

Okay, well I'd like to plug God.

I'd like to plug wind.

I'd like to...

I want to plug...

She goes from God.

He's trying to make a band.

He wants me to plug September.

September.

Do you remember?

I do.

Yes, I do.

You know I do.

I do.

That's one thing we can say about storming.

She remembers.

Okay.

She recalls.

Yep.

Stormy remembers.

Alright, Ricky, what do you want to plug?

Well, since I've been out of the loop, the one thing, the one good thing I've been able to do is catch up on my favorite guy's podcast, Matt Apocaca.

He's put out a couple of episodes of his very good Weezer podcast called What's With These Homies Talking About Weezer.

Yeah.

And those have been really fun.

And he's now putting out episodes of Get Played with Nick Weiger and Heather Ant Campbell, so you can keep listening to those.

And on their Patreon, they talk about only anime and anime is truly a lot of fun to watch.

And I watch...

We're not Hentai.

You talk about Hentai?

We have not reviewed any Hentai yet.

All you need is chill.

Yeah, that's where I learned about all you need is kill.

Okay.

And that's patreon.com slash get played.

Alright.

Yeah, let's check that out.

What about Monja?

Multabene.

Yeah.

Do you watch Monja?

I want...

You know, you read Monja.

You read Monja.

You watch anime.

And you have a smug Monja.

Yes.

Smokey de Monja.

Monja?

Can I still do that?

Respect Monja.

I mean, I heard a detective or something that co-hosted on an earlier portion of the podcast doing quite a questionable accent.

So I think you can still do that.

I want to plug...

Look, the comedy bang bang book called Comedy Bang Bang the Book...

Er, no, Comedy Bang Bang the podcast.

The book is coming out in April and you can pre-order it now.

Just go to CBBworld.com slash book.

Also when you're at CBB World, you can get a subscription.

We have all of our past episodes plus ad-free episodes.

If you're tired of listening to me talk and do the ads, you can go over there and subscribe.

And we also have other shows CBB Presents.

We have, I believe, an Entre P. Newer showed came out recently, which is Entre P. Newer's entrepreneur tour.

And yes.

I like when the insert adds into a podcast that the hosts don't read.

Yeah.

And it's like you're going to listen to your fun podcast.

And it's like, blood loss is no joke.

You need blood to live or whatever it is.

How come I haven't gotten an ad for blood?

Blood has inspired this show.

I've been writing to hosts of podcasts to please take those out.

I think that's a really good thing to do.

You write them personally?

Yeah, write them personally.

Please just say, hey, could you remove those ads from your podcast from you?

About blood.

Yeah, yeah.

I love writing to podcasts.

Yeah, I love it.

That's all I do.

All day.

Just writing to podcasts all day.

Yeah.

Where's all the time go?

Yeah.

Well, uh...

All day I dream about writing podcasts.

So go to CBB World and get all your shows there.

All right.

Let us close up the old plug bag.

Doors are made for closing.

So we take them up and shut them tight and then doors are made for locking.

So we take our key and make it right.

We turn it to right.

Oh, no, that's unlocked.

At the time you open the plug bag, open the plug bag, open the plug bag.

Open the plug bag.

Everybody loves it.

We don't need to get turned into the right head.

Open the plug bag.

When you're building the plug bag, then the root is right.

You get it.

Get your friends together and open the plug.

It's names.

Open.

Oh, yeah.

That was great.

That was a thousand bags by our good friend, Ashley Simpson.

Thanks so much.

Ashley Simpson for that remix.

Keep them coming, guys.

That makes it so much more palatable than the original version.

Yeah.

The original version is not good.

It's bad.

Oh, yeah.

It's bad and long.

It acted like I knew it and I didn't know it.

Yeah.

You've never heard this show, have you?

No.

Why are you here?

I get lonely.

Well, come back any time.

Thank you.

My wife.

Will you be my wife?

My wife?

What?

My wife.

You're married to Borat, too.

Borat's two time.

I married to Borat, too.

His brother.

Oh, he had the director on recently.

He does the same act as Borat.

Oh, yeah.

Well, guys, I want to thank you so much.

Ted, always a pleasure to see you.

No, we just met.

Thank you.

Sorry.

I for a second look rather than your target.

Sorry, always a pleasure to talk to you.

Well, thanks.

That's your telling on yourself.

Yeah.

You're off to the valley.

Oh, I'm off to the valley once or twice if you know what I'm saying.

And Ricky, go to the desert.

Can you take me, please?

Yes.

You want me to take you to the...

Tell me.

Can I sit in the back?

Can you buy gas?

Desert bus is fun.

The show videos.

I didn't have a job during the loop, babe.

Stop talking like Dennis Miller, and I'll drive you to the desert.

All right?

I get no respect.

All right, you can talk like Rodney.

All right.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks.

Bye.
