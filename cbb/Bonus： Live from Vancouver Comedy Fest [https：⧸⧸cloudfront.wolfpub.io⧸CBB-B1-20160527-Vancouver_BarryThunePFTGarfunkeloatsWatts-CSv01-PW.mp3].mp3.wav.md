♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Yes, and welcome to Comedy Death Radio from Vancouver!

Yeah!

This is a special bonus episode.

I am not coming to you from the normal studios in Indy 10101, but rather from the Vancouver Comedy Festival, where I think I found out how many listeners this show has in Vancouver, upwards of eight, and they're all staring at me right now.

Not a full room, but we're going to have a great time.

First of all, I want to say thank you to the maker of our new theme song, Mr. Reggie Watts is my house band!

Thank you, thank you very much, thank you, thank you, thank you.

Reggie, you're a friend of the show, you were on a couple of weeks ago, made a big splash.

How'd that splash go for you?

You know, I have one.

I'm still recovering from the ramifications of what an appearance on this show will do for you in a place like Vancouver.

I don't remember what came in between these two moments.

You're going to be here instead of playing the normal comedy songs that we do on the show, Reggie's going to be treating us with some of his music.

That'll be fun, and just stuff you're just going to come up with.

It's a lot of observations being here less than 24 hours.

That's right, a lot, oh so much.

Funzies.

I'm going to turn from my left to my immediate right, where my co-host for the day, Mr. Nick Thune is here.

Thank you, thank you guys.

Thank you so much.

Now are you, are we able to hear you on that, Mike?

I don't know if you can.

Huh, interesting, well we'll find out, I'm sure it.

I want to thank our friend from XM, XFM.

Where are you guys from?

XM, is that a Canadian thing or do we have that in the States?

Stateside, I call it.

Not really interesting.

So America.

Nick Thune, you just got into the airport, from the airport rather, literally 15 minutes ago.

I saw you and I said, this is a godsend.

I need someone to save this show.

Bring them in.

I wrangled you as they call it.

I just took you by the arm and I shook you and I said you're going to do my show.

A little bit of a little casting process.

Yeah, no, we had a little bit of that in the other room.

How'd that go for you?

Good, I felt like, you know, it was between me and me.

So I felt like, I felt like I beat myself out for the role, to be honest.

First time you ever beat yourself out?

Yeah.

That goes out to the person who loves the weekly dick jokes that I do.

Is there one person?

There's one person who's written to be used as he enjoys them.

Now Nick, you had a little trouble at the airport.

First of all, let me just say, how many of you were at the Comedy Death Race show?

We did last night.

Thank you guys very much.

Now we were supposed to, Paul and Tomkins clapping away.

He was there.

First of all, let me just say, we were supposed to have Andy Dick at the show.

Andy and I, and BJ Porter, we are all working on a project together currently.

And we worked up a whole bunch of sketches for this project.

And we were going to debut them here at the festival.

And he was not led into the country.

I heard it was because he had something on his ankle.

That is actually untrue.

He's allowed anywhere he wants to go with that ankle from the US side.

But the ankle it is for alcohol?

It monitors his alcohol progress, yes.

How does it do that?

Every half hour it actually shocks him or inserts something.

Yeah.

And then this is true, unfortunately.

It wakes him up from his sleep every half hour.

You would think that his whole life he had went on.

Just not being able to sleep.

But no, it's just recent.

But he, every half hour it records the, I actually believe how he explained it to me is that, and welcome to the two of you by the way.

We have a free show going on here.

The cast of Falcon Crest just walked in.

We have, basically what it does, I believe is that when you drink alcohol, the odors emanate from your body.

And what this does is it picks up on those odors, records whether or not there are odors, and then transmits it back to the US.

Now, he brought his modem with him that would trans...

A wireless modem that the US officials say, you know, just bring that with you.

If you ever leave the country or go anywhere.

He has Wi-Fi basically on his ankle.

Yeah, exactly.

He gets free Wi-Fi from his ankle now.

That's the one benefit.

To send it back to him is he need to find a Wi-Fi spot or is it just...

He needs to find a hot spot.

Certainly he just goes into a Starbucks.

So anyway, he was all fine for the US side of things, and they were going to let him through.

But my lovely wife, Coolup, and I were on the plane with him.

And as we were...

It's on her Twitter page.

That's right.

As we were leaving the airport, everything seemed to be going great.

He went through customs, everything was nice.

As he's leaving the airport, two armed guards just casually took him by the shoulder and just walked him right into another room.

And we never saw him again.

So he already went through the first process.

He went through the first process and just taken away just like Mr. Dick come right this way and he vanished.

Did you notice that they wrote anything on the back of that custom sheet?

In retrospect, I believe they put an X on it or something that we did not get.

And a one and a two?

Did you get a one and a two?

I did.

Well, no, I don't want to get it.

I had an X one and two.

Now we're going to get to this.

You yourself had a lot of trouble coming in to the country as well.

And I've had my troubles getting in.

I was detained for two hours once myself.

And I like in Canada a lot to like crab legs.

Have you seen locked up abroad?

I was about to tell a joke.

See now let me explain your co-host duties to you here, Dick.

I would thought I was feeding you a joke.

Oh, you're about to feed me a joke?

Okay, here I am.

Feed me the rock.

What do you got?

Have you ever seen locked up abroad?

No.

Then the joke won't work.

Very good.

Fantastic.

But Canada, it has a share of troubles that we all go through.

Reggie Watts, have you were telling me once that you had trouble getting in?

Yes, I did.

Now, to be fair, you look like a crazy homeless person.

I do.

I thought they would give me the advantage.

Apparently I was wrong.

No, I went to go do it.

I wanted to do a shoe here.

And when I got here, the promoter didn't have any work permit for me.

So I was being honest.

I was like, absolutely.

I have a show to do.

It's going to be awesome tonight.

Should have some paperwork.

And of course he didn't have any paperwork in my manager.

He was like, you're an idiot.

You were supposed to say you're just visiting.

I'm like, I don't lie.

See, now that's what happened to me.

I was told to say I was just visiting and I did.

Oh.

And they googled me and they looked me up on the internet and said, you're not on this show tomorrow night.

Oh my God.

And then they took me in the waiting room and gave me a lecture.

I felt like I was being lectured by my dad.

So, can the city save you?

No, not this time.

Not like all the other times.

Google saved me today.

Really?

Oh, that's okay.

They just googled me.

I just said, where's your proof that you're on this festival?

Because I said I'm not getting paid so they asked me, are you an amateur?

And I said, well, yeah, I guess I'm an amateur.

I'm not getting paid to perform in Canada.

Did you tell them that you were on the Jay Leno show last night?

Did that ever come up?

I didn't drop the name.

No.

You didn't drop Jay's name?

No, your ace, though.

I almost dropped Rush Limbaugh's name, who I did Fist Pound last night.

Really?

Yeah.

In a hallway, Rush, I walked by him after I got out of stage and he was going to go on stage and he was like walking with a group of like all these people and I walked to their group and I'm like the bearded guy walking by him and he looks up and he puts his fist out.

And I honestly didn't know what to do.

I just touched it really softly.

And then he walked, I mean, it was just a very intense moment.

I wish I could have taken it back.

Really?

You want to take back that Fist Pound?

Yeah.

Even though you did it softly.

It was a soft...

Do you want to take it back because you wanted to do it harder and like...

I wish I was going to start it first.

I was mostly focused.

He wears a huge hearing aid.

Really?

Yeah.

And I thought it was like a live news feed that somebody told me it's a hearing aid.

Oh, interesting.

Now, so you didn't drop his name?

What a Canadian...

Not any drop any names.

I said just Google it though.

Right.

Did they?

Yeah, they did it.

And that is why you're here.

Yeah.

Once they googled it, did they say, oh, I'm so stupid.

I said I googled this earlier.

I said, did you google Image Me?

And they said no.

And I said, okay.

What would have come up if they had Google Image Me?

Just really great pictures of me.

I've had somebody optimize it so all my favorite ones come up on the first five pages.

Really?

How do you do that?

Just pay somebody like...

Is that your friend Optimus Prime?

I believe I heard all of the talking...

You gave me a Bronx cheer on that one.

Well, we're going to have a lot of fun.

We're all here in Canada.

We're all glad to be a part of the festival.

Coming up on the show today, I should say we have Todd Berry giving us a live, rare live performance.

He doesn't do a lot of shows, especially here in Canada, but he's dropped by.

He's going to perform for all of you here.

We have Garfunkel and Oates is going to be here giving a less rare live performance.

And our good friend to the show, you guys, you must have heard him on a show probably about four weeks ago, I would say, a good friend to the show.

Ice tea is going to be on the show, so that is...

He's going to be dropping in.

But before we get Todd out here, he's coming up next.

Let's hear a little bit from Reggie Watts.

Reggie, take it away.

♪♪ ♪♪ Reggie Watts.

♪♪ Alright, well, we have a very special guest here.

Whichever one you want, Todd, whichever one you like.

You're going to come up from the audience, you decide that's the way to do it.

You could come from just to hide behind these curtains right here and then come out like it's the Tonight Show.

Do you want to try that?

Or the J-Lenna Show, either one.

Robeson, I'm not sure how you pronounce it.

I'm going to...

That's local street.

Right from the... I like right from the crowd.

If you could come up and high five people as you're coming up, that would...

You're not one to normally high five, but...

That's true, that is a good point.

You have seen him do stand up on Letterman.

You have seen him do stand up in the movie The Wrestler.

Please welcome Todd Berry!

Thank you, Scott.

Thank you for insisting I do a stand up spot.

One I basically said, I don't want to do it.

I couldn't have made it clear that I don't want to do this.

But you told me that it really is better if I do it.

I basically said, I'm not doing it.

And here I am about to do it.

Unless I choose not to do it.

No, I would actually feel...

I'd feel bad if I left Vancouver without performing in an empty hotel conference.

I mean, to be standing on the same stage as a guy yesterday was showing key chain samples.

To a group of potential key chain buyers.

Seems like I would go on in this room.

I'm just painting a picture for the people listening.

Someone's chewing ice and that has to stop.

This is like when I did Letterman, I had to stop someone from chewing ice.

All right, do you edit this show?

I feel like I've already done four minutes.

Can I just riff the whole thing?

Okay, let me just ask, are people laughing at home?

That was their chance to answer.

And I probably hear them.

Anyway, I don't know if anyone saw me on Letterman August 28th, but I'm going to do a selection of jokes from that performance.

It was like this.

It was also in a conference room.

It was at a Hampton Inn.

It was in the Oak Leaf room at the Hampton Inn, just outside of Columbus, Ohio.

Okay.

Anyway, here we go.

I have been traveling a lot, people.

See?

This is why this is not a good idea.

They're laughing at me actually attempting to do.

Well, now we filled it out a bit.

Welcome, fellas.

Two people just walked in with backpacks.

If we were in New York, I would have to call the cops right now.

We're getting laughs out in the lobby.

Can someone go out in the lobby and get those people?

They see my glasses.

I just want to fill this conference room, people.

All right.

I have been traveling, Scott, Nick, Reggie.

I went to Barcelona.

Very aggressive prostitutes there.

They come right up to you and just grab you.

I'm like, whoa, baby.

This is our refuge in the middle of the street.

What's going to happen when we get back to the youth hostel?

You were going to knock me off that top bunk.

I'm going to crash right into a Danish runaway.

Knock the Macbook out of his hands.

I'm just laying back until Reggie's done laughing.

That was a pro move on my part.

A lot of people would have just buried his laugh now.

I let it ring out.

And he didn't laugh into one of his petals either.

That was a totally acoustic laugh.

Okay.

I'm just going to do one more joke.

Then I'm going to sit down.

This is the way you handle a situation like this.

Imagine if I came up here and just fucking vagased it.

You know what that means, vagasing?

Do you?

I mean slick and posh.

Polish.

That's the word I'm on.

I'm always posh no matter where I am.

Any requests?

I'm not doing a fucking ancient joke like that, man.

What's that?

Math quest.

Oh, that one.

You're requesting the same joke.

I don't want to hear that joke.

I want to hear this joke.

That's the same fucking joke.

You think you're going to stump me on my own jokes?

That are done until I'm fucking bored to tears with them?

Oh, this ain't a fucking joke.

Wow.

Maybe I should do that joke, man.

No, I don't do requests, man.

I do what I want to do whenever I want to do it.

Except if someone says, do you want to do a podcast?

Do you guys like it?

I'm keeping it loose.

I'm only doing three minutes and I've done 25 stuff.

And gotten one joke out.

I think I've proved my point.

I'm like a real funny person.

Not just someone that has material that someone goes throughout for them.

Like everyone else on this show.

Yeah, I'm accusing them of having ghost tracks.

Anyway, by request, I'm about to do a joke I don't want to do.

I'm not going to do that one.

I'll do the, uh, I'll do it.

What's that?

The toaster joke.

I don't even know what you're talking about.

I think you're fucking toasted, my friend.

I just fucking destroyed him.

And then I have to sit on the panel with him.

I just fucking destroyed one of the fellow guests on this, whatever the show is.

This isn't really a show, isn't it?

I like that I'm going to force you to edit this show now.

It's like it was weird.

It was like an hour and Tom, I did 53 minutes of it.

And he did nothing.

But I loved every second of it.

That's someone's comment they're going to post.

Okay, here we go.

I know what I'm going to do.

I'm going to do this one.

Uh, I live in New York.

Had some friends visit me from California.

Very nice people, but, uh, very cocky about their Mexican food.

I'll be like, hey, I want to get some dinner?

Sure.

Want to get Mexican food?

Oh, I can't do that.

You don't like Mexican food?

I love it, but I'm from California.

You're from Mexico?

No, I'm from California.

You don't know what Mexican food is like.

I do.

I had it three days ago.

New York City has about 10,000 amazing chefs.

Believe it or not, a handful of them have figured out how to replicate the quesadilla.

You know what else we have in New York?

We have Mexican people.

And we let them cook in restaurants.

And you know what else?

Our food's better than yours.

Across the board, including, and specifically, Mexican.

Bonus joke?

You got it.

People are really precious about Italian food also.

I know people won't need Italian food at a restaurant.

They always say the same thing.

I'm not going to spend $10 for a dollar's worth of pasta.

Plus, no one makes Italian food like my grandmother.

Well, you do spend a little extra for Italian food at a restaurant, but for that extra $9, you get a heaping side order of not hanging out with your grandmother.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

Here's a million dollars for a plate of pasta.

Keep that woman away from this restaurant.

Although that shouldn't be a problem because it's after two o'clock in the afternoon.

You guys have been tremendous.

Todd Berry, let him hear it.

He's walking over to the panel.

Thank you very much, Todd.

I appreciate you coming on and doing the show.

You live in New York, so you're not out in LA.

You're never out on a Friday.

I've tried to get you on the show many, many times.

Oh, on this show.

On this show, and this is the only way I could get you as if you came out here to Vancouver and did a 3 p.m. in a ballroom.

What hotel do you do at an LA?

Now, Todd, please tell me you're kidding with that.

I was a mean joke.

I was a mean, mean, mean joke.

Todd, thank you so much.

Thanks, Todd.

I think I handled that.

How's your staying Vancouver been?

It's pretty good, man.

We had a show last night.

Oh, yeah.

Someone, you may have heard about this on the Twitter adi are all a buzz, but someone shouted at Todd during a sat.

Isn't that right?

Yeah, they were not nice to me.

Now, for the radio listener, he's frowning.

I just made a sad face, people.

Like a sad, sad baby would.

Yeah.

But yeah, they were nice, but lots of people wrote to me and apologized on behalf of Vancouver.

That was very nice.

Vancouver, people.

They're very, very nice.

Now, maybe the listener could not pick it up, but the joke that Nick and I were requesting is about Mick Jagger, which I am constantly paraphrasing because it comes up all the time.

People asking you questions.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

It's basically the theme of it is...

I'm going to go ahead and do the joke.

Yes.

The joke is, how is it going out?

Oh, I have a website.

It's got my email address on it.

No, it's not the whole joke.

There's more.

People outside thought the joke was over.

No, I got to tell my email address on it.

So now I get emails from all over the country and people ask unbelievable questions.

They'll be like, do you hear Todd?

I'm going to see your show on Friday.

Do you know old?

You have to be to get into that club?

Oh, yeah.

You want to maybe call the club with that one?

Instead of writing directly to the artist?

Do you think Mick Jagger gets emails like that?

Dear Mick, I'm going to see it Madison Square Garden next week.

I'm going to have to leave straight from work.

Not going to have time to get anything to eat.

Do you know how much they charge for a hot dog?

Also, I haven't been there a while.

Can you map quest me directions?

Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones.

Mick at Rollingstones.com.

Wow, that killed.

I should have done that earlier, man.

So you see why we were begging for it?

Todd, can I say that?

I did that joke on Letterman a couple of years ago and a guy emailed me immediately and was like, that fucking Keith Richards joke you do was old.

It was Mick Jagger.

And thanks for emailing me two seconds after I just watched myself on TV.

The public.

Another sad face for God.

I got to stop being so accessible.

No, turn off your Google alerts.

Can I stay up here?

Do you want to?

Really?

I do.

Okay.

Yeah, we're, yes, Todd Barry, everyone let him hear it.

He's going to stay the whole hour.

Oh, fucking hour.

I know it's an hour.

Oh, you got to get out.

No, I will stay up here and I will chime in.

Okay, please do.

We may need to share.

Nothing I like better than chiming in.

I will not share my key there.

Okay, try to keep it to a minimum though.

All right, so let's hear another song from Reggie who wants to hear that.

I do.

I know I do.

All right.

Okay.

All right, where it's in your CD, our radio here.

Here's a new song from Rip Van Tinkle.

This is entitled The Crabman Strikes at Midnight.

The Crabman Comes at Night.

The Crabman Strikes at Night.

The Crabman Comes at Night.

Okay.
