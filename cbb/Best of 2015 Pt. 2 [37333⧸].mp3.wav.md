♪♪♪ Your pink, panted, tush makes my shy, chubby blush. Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang.

Ha, our guest does not like it. Thank you to the Voblax catchphrase all star.

That's from the Voblax.

Come on, Voblax!

Catchphrase all star the Voblax submitted that. By the way, I did not credit our previous episodes catchphrase all star, Shampooedler, for the WebMD one. So I wanted to retroactively do that, thanks to them. I almost said him.

Honor. Honor restored to the Shampooedler name.

Welcome to Comedy Bang Bang. This is the best of episode number two where we count down your top 15, sorry, 14. God damn it. All ready?

So this is number, episode number two of a countdown that counts down.

14 to 7.

To 1. To 7, Evan. To 7, Evan. No, we're going to, on today's episodes, we're counting down the top 14. On today's episode, we're counting down 10, 9, 8, and 7.

10, 9, 8, and 7.

Top 10 here. We're cracking the top 10. Cracking the top 10!

Cracking the top 10!

Do you remember baking a plain cake? Yep, I do. Remember that from four years ago or so?

Taking a plane break. Couple studios ago. Yeah, boy. Wow.

Yeah. Yeah.

I almost wanted to cue Ryan for it, but he has no idea what it is. That is before Ryan. He does?

He does? Engineer Cody Ryan has it. Here, let's hear it.

♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Yeah!

♪♪♪ ♪ Make it a play-cave ♪ ♪ Make it a play-cave ♪ ♪ Make it a play-cave ♪ ♪ Make it a play-cave ♪ Oh boy, that was fun.

It was a lot of fun.

Oh, I actually got lightheaded from that.

Yeah, you were screaming at the top of your lungs.

I couldn't even do that scream.

Oh boy, I can't even do it at the pitch that the singer does.

Guys, he's high, he sings it high.

We used to sing, taking a plane break because back in the early, the very first studio, now where we started the show, because that was at Indy 1013-1 in their studio.

But when we moved to the first-year-old studio...

Yeah, 103.1 street.

Yes, we...

Well, what's it?

It was something like that.

I think so, but...

It was also the...

It was the floor.

The floor?

Yeah.

It was floor 103-1, and above us was 103-2 or something.

That's right.

But in our first-year-old studio, it was in basically almost like a crack house.

Yeah, it was a weird neighborhood.

It was a ski-v.

Yeah, it was a ski-v.

Right next to a medical marijuana place.

And also right next to an alley where there were people constantly foraging for recyclables, I believe.

There was also a casting office in that same building.

Yes.

So you'd see people occasionally that you knew and be ashamed like you were going to buy crack somewhere and then knew that.

Or be cast in something.

Right.

That even worse.

And we would hear air traffic a lot and we would hear planes overhead a lot.

And so anytime we heard a plane that was really loud, I would play that song in order to cover up the noise of the plane and we would sing, taking a plane break, no matter what happened.

And I still to this day get people saying they missed plane breaks.

And that was our holiday when Paul F. Tompkins here was playing Cake Boss.

He was doing his character Cake Boss.

We intentionally, after we moved to a soundproof studio, we intentionally sang one when people were saying, I really miss him.

You said that you were baking a plane cake.

Well, it was this long setup where you asked me, you were asking me, what has anyone ever asked you to do a cake with no decorations?

No frosting.

What would you be doing then?

It was like this very convoluted thing to get me to say the phrase, baking a plane cake.

And then we played that and we sang baking a plane cake.

A great moment in Comedy Bang Bang history.

I'm GM in CBBH.

But speaking of GM's in CBBH, we are here.

I am Scott Ockerman, your host, of course, for Comedy Bang Bang.

And I'm here with my good friend, Paul F. Tompkins.

I'm Paul F. Tompkins.

We are show business friends and we are counting down.

And we are real life enemies.

A lot of people don't know that about us.

The minute the mics are turned off, constantly plotting to destroy each other.

Hasn't happened yet.

But yes, we are here counting down your top 14 episodes of the year of 2015.

And in this particular episode, we've cracked the top 10.

We're going to hear 10 through 7 or is it 8?

What is it?

Yeah, 10 through 11.

And...

To learn through 7.

And some really great clips on this episode.

I'm really pleased to punch.

I'm glad to hear that.

You know what?

Here's what I was worried about, Scott.

Yeah, I'm on.

I thought like hear me now.

I thought that...

Do read them.

That we would hear great clips in the first chunk of Best ofs.

And then this one.

They were going to be terrible.

No, I think...

But then you're telling me they're good.

No, these ones in this episode, I think A+.

A more than C+.

Which is your standard grade.

You say, why do we need other grades?

C++.

Sorry, I ever did that.

No, I'm proud of you.

You should be.

Really?

I'm proud of you.

Here's what happens though, is that you take...

People take those references.

A lot of times I'm telling them to other things.

Can I say to anyone who is a fan?

Who is a fan of the show who knows the C++ inside joke?

Don't send that to people, guests on the show who don't know the joke.

Without explanation.

Yeah.

Because occasionally people who don't know the ins and outs of this program and why would they?

Are on the show, they think they did a great job and someone sends them a tweet saying, C++ job and they're like, what?

Like, why would I ever go back to the show?

Please, just send nice things.

You know who does it the most is people who listen to Hollywood handbook.

Yeah.

People and the craziest references they will tweet to other people and people don't know.

I had an exchange with Lauren Lapkis where she was like, she texted me, said, do you know why people are writing to me saying they want to eat my hair?

And I said, as a matter of fact, I do.

And I had to send her the whole explanation of that which is from an ad to those guys did on her show.

Oh, jeez.

And so she was like, all right, all right, I kind of figured that.

And then like a day later, she tweeted out, whenever anyone says me something that I don't understand, I figure it must be a Hollywood handbook reference.

Well, people send me and you, I would presume references from this show all the time, especially when the episodes come out.

Yeah.

I will wake up sometimes and there will be a ton of stuff in my inbox that I don't.

I don't remember the episodes that well after.

I look into my inbox.

In my inbox.

What's this?

Who?

In my inbox.

What do you say at my inbox?

What is that?

What is it?

That's what I like.

Is it whales?

Oh, so Michael Sheen, it's like a mix.

It's a mixture between Welsh and Scottish.

It's in my inbox.

What?

I feel like I can do that better than I can do Irish.

Oh, you're as I proved.

You're a legendary Irish accent.

I thought I had a lock on that.

There was an episode of this show that I think we recorded in March.

And I was trying to get you to say, more.

More.

And I can remember it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

More.

I remember it now because people remind me of it.

More.

It takes me a little while to catch up to it, but I'll get the inside jokes.

By the way, recent pyramid news.

Speaking of inside jokes.

That's right.

There was some recent pyramid news.

There was some pyramid news.

Dr. Ben Carson.

I, a couple years ago, how did it come about?

I said recent pyramid news.

It was.

I would think I was Richard Harrow.

Okay.

And there was some out.

I was talking about pyramids and you were kind of giving me a hard time because I don't know.

It was like not.

I think I can't remember.

I was saying like, have we gotten any recent pyramid news and you pointed it out, I think.

But maybe.

And since then there has been recent pyramid news with Dr.

Ben Carson.

Yeah.

Who says the agent is using put a grain in it.

It's so grain.

It's so grain in there.

In those solid triangles.

That's right.

Um, Ben Carson, by the way, awfully close to Bill Cosby.

Really?

Ben Carson bill Cosby Ben.

Oh, the name is not as a person.

Ben Carson, Dr. Ben Carson, Dr. Bill Cosby, Dr. Ben Carson, Dr. Bill Cosby, Bart DeBere.

From the edge.

Bart DeBere Bart DeBere.

Bart DeBere Bart DeBere Bart DeBere Bart DeBere Bart DeBere Bart DeBere Bart DeBere Bart.

So close.

Ben Carson.

Not bears.

Welcome to the show.

This is what you're going to get.

Every year in December for the last couple of weeks, Paul if Tom Hkins and I collect ourselves.

What am I trying to say?

What do you say?

Well, we come in in quite a state.

Oh my goodness.

And then we have to collect ourselves.

We've all had, we've had crazy days.

Oh my goodness.

Heavens.

I got caught in the rain.

I had a newspaper over my head.

Oh, I have the vapors.

We get down to our fainty couches.

Someone comes in with smelling salts and brings us around.

They snap at our faces.

Isn't that what smelling salts are?

They break them open like this.

I used to think when I read about them.

That's a modern medical thing.

I think they actually have vials that they snap.

Yeah, yeah.

When I read about them, I assumed it was like a salt shaker that they would like pour in your face.

I always pictured it as a jar.

Like a weird little jar.

Like a jar someone farts in and opens it up on your nose.

Exactly what I thought.

Scott, how did you know?

It's like you're reading my mind.

Wait a minute.

Maybe I could read my...

Yeah.

There's probably...

Did it take that long to find out?

It probably froze it.

Wow.

Hey, you know what?

It's like limitless.

I always...

I've always said I might be bulletproof.

You might be.

I don't want to find out.

That's right.

But I very well could be.

I want that pill.

Give me that pill.

What if the pill...

Give me that pill.

Hey, I want that pill.

I want...

Hey.

I'm watching you.

Give me that pill.

I see you with that pill.

I want it.

I'm walking here.

Give me that pill.

Analyze this.

I'm going to get to analyze the other thing.

Oh my gosh.

Harold Ramis passed away too soon.

R2D2 soon.

He was a robot.

Yeah, Harold Ramis was a robot.

Harold Ramis was a robot.

Don't joke about iRobot though.

Please don't.

Take care.

Please.

If we can impart upon you one thing during this holiday season...

And it is Christmas Eve by the way.

Yes.

Christmas.

Don't joke about iRobot.

Stop it.

What a wonderful song that would be.

This Christmas don't joke about iRobot.

Don't joke about iRobot.

We should record it.

There's so much stuff to joke about.

We should record it this year.

We should record that for next year.

For next year.

We'll do it.

Okay.

Keep us to that.

We'll forget about it.

This Christmas don't joke about iRobot.

That is the title.

It'll be country in western.

Alright.

Okay.

Country on western.

Will it have like a little spoken word break out?

Of course.

We'll get special guests on it too.

It'll be like a we are the world type thing.

Don't want to know those in a while.

Okay.

In a while.

Welcome to the show.

What we're going to do here is we're going to play you clips.

You guys all voted on these.

We voted from Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving of this year.

And these are the episodes that you voted for the most.

And we're cracking the top 10.

And we may as well get to it.

Let's get to the first episode on today's Countdown.

This is number 10.

Number 10.

Mmm.

Oh, baby.

This is.

Oh.

This is.

This is episode 365.

Oh.

As many episodes as there are days in this year, not next year.

That's wild.

That's right.

That is wild.

Next year.

That is wild.

That is weird.

That is wild.

That is crazy stuff.

Wild.

I feel like I still can't do it.

That is wild.

Oh.

That is wrong with me.

Apparently.

That is wild.

Apparently.

That's another word that gets me.

Yeah.

Apparently.

Oh, that is wild.

That is Carson, of course.

Of course that is Carson.

Ben Carson.

Dr. Bill Cosby Carson.

I cut open a human skull.

That was wild.

Pyramids were used for great.

That is wild.

I think I should be present.

That is wild.

That is the wildest of them all.

Not to get political.

Dad, I think you're political.

He's a weirdo.

He's a fucking weirdo.

He's a strange human being.

He's a really weird dude.

All right.

Apologies if you listen to the show and you're somehow a supporter of him.

I don't know how that would be.

Not from me though.

No apologies for me.

Okay.

Apologies for me.

Guess what?

You're a weirdo.

Okay.

Episode 365, July 27.

We're in the midpoint.

We're about like, hump week.

It's Saturday in the park.

I think it was July 27.

Boy, Jimmy Pardo just got three boners pumping through his skull.

They're in the rock and roll hall.

They're just like, boom, boom.

It just like pops through his eye.

What?

The back of his head.

It's a frog with you.

Why imagine?

Why is that?

That's what happened.

What is that?

It's an image that you have in your brain.

They're in the rock and roll hall of fame.

Just got into the car.

The three boners.

The three boners of fusion skull.

Okay.

Do you think a band could have the name the three boners and get into the rock and roll of?

Well, cheap trick got in there.

Oh, yeah.

And what does that mean again?

That means a prostitute.

It was expensive.

Yeah, Chicago's in.

And I think Jimmy's going to do everything in his power to be there.

To be at the induction ceremony.

Because what if Satera gets in there and like sings a song with him?

After how that we've been through, I will make it up to you.

I promise to.

And after all that's been said and done, you're just a part of me.

I can't let go.

Do you want to be there?

We should go.

Yeah, we should go.

We should go and make it so that Jimmy can't go.

Yeah, we should take his seats.

Two guys that don't care.

We should bully him.

We should meet him outside the bank.

I don't bully him.

Yes.

And we should kick his ass to steal his ticket.

Yes.

And back and forth between us.

Hey, pound, pound, pound.

What are you buying books?

Hey, pound.

We're here for Satera.

That's the Midlands.

That's how they talk in the Midlands.

Oh, the Midlands.

I got to get there someday.

Got to get there.

Okay, this is episode 365 from July 27.

This is an episode called Bongo versus Bongo's.

That's right.

This is Jason Manzukas and Andy Daly.

That's right.

This is the, by the way, they were the winners of last year's countdown.

That's right.

Yeah, that's right.

They won for episode 300, did they not?

It was quite a saga.

It's not a winning thing.

They were number one.

Why are we doing this thing?

That's true.

Okay, they won last year.

Yeah.

Jason Manzukas, of course, people know him as Raffi from the league and Andy Daly, who has been on this, both of these guys have been on the show for as long as we've been doing it.

And Andy Daly has done several characters.

Andy got pretty busy this year and could not be on the show quite as much.

He's doing a review, his TV show, his hilarious TV show, which everyone should check out.

And is in critics.

Boy, I love when the top 10s come out.

Top 10s too.

I do too.

Because you know you're not going to be bothered with people saying, hey, you made the top 10 this year.

Exactly.

To be fair, some people gave me some nice notices for my stand-up special that was on this year, which was very nice.

How many bang bang went pretty unremarked upon?

I wish that.

And I believe we did 40 pretty good episodes this year.

I agree.

There's too much TV.

I'm just happy we're on the air.

There's plenty of TV.

I don't think there's too much.

I think that there is.

There's enough that people can be entertained constantly.

Remember back in the day when you'd be like, God, there's nothing on it.

Yeah, there's a lot to choose from.

And you can find the things that are to your taste.

But I have to say, if you're listening to the show, the comedy by a bank TV show is so funny.

And I enjoy it every single week.

Thank you so much.

I mean, it's different from the podcast, but it's similar enough.

But it's hilarious.

But the sensibility, I think, is the same.

You know, I feel like we did something never achieved by any sketch show.

40 episodes in a year.

I think it's pretty amazing.

But hey, you know what we do.

And each one very not just funny, but very intensive.

Distinct, yeah.

Distinct.

We did some things like the one take episode and the upside down episode.

Anyway.

Terrific guests.

It's on my top 10 list.

I enjoyed it.

It's on the top 10 list of my heart, but not the one I publish online.

Wait a minute.

I'm sorry.

You're a long Meyer fan.

I feel dumb now.

Long I got so good.

You've done me.

Phillip is on there.

All right.

In any case, Andy Daley's review is on a lot of top 10 lists.

And rightfully so.

That's a great show.

And so they were doing this episode together reuniting.

They hadn't done an episode together for a while.

And Andy is doing a character new to comedy bang bang, which he had, I believe he had started on the Womp it Up podcast, which is a spin off podcast of comedy bang bang.

The Marissa Whampler.

The first comedy bang bang spin off.

Maybe I can't recall.

Is it the first?

I'm not sure.

I don't even know at this point.

I think that it is the first one.

Some people are created on that show on this show.

People would say the Andy Daley pilot thing, but he created a lot of those characters before comedy bang bang.

But then Jessica St Clair did Marissa on stage once.

Oh, did she really?

Yeah.

I saw her do it in a UCB show.

She had like a neck brace.

I think it may have been one of the only times she ever did it on stage.

Then it's not a spin off at all.

So there have been no comedy.

There have been no spin offs.

Thank you very much.

You really let me down the garden path on that one.

So this is a new character that Andy had done on one episode of Womp It Up.

This is a teacher at Marissa Whampler's High School, I believe.

He is the health teacher.

One thing I need to mention because otherwise you'll be confused, Talking Tang is a podcast that Jason Manzuchas had decided he was going to start in a previous episode.

A previous episode we may hear from a little later in our countdown.

But he mentions Talking Tang a few times.

That's what that is about.

And this is it.

This is Jason Ass himself and Andy Daly playing Jimmy Bongo's.

And this is your...

I thought it was Joe Bongo's.

I can't remember.

It's both.

We'll talk about it.

I remember now.

This is your number 10.

Number 10.

Please welcome Joe Bongo.

How's it going?

How are you?

Hello Joe.

I'm gonna be here.

I brought my Bongo.

You certainly did.

Holy cow.

This is my second podcast.

I was on what you call it.

The wild wampering.

I forgot that I didn't bring my Bongo's.

I said the whole time.

I should have brought my Bongo's.

And so now I got them.

Oh.

So you're on Womp It Up.

This is the person I know from Raina Del Rey High School is...

I know a couple of people I know Marissa Wompler.

That's the one.

Yes.

From the STARTS program.

And yeah, right.

They have the two of them have the Wompers.

And they do the podcast.

And I was on that.

And we had a lot of fun.

Her birthday is coming up.

I would imagine we'll see her real soon.

Oh, you got a birthday coming up?

Yeah, she did.

That's so funny.

It seems like everybody's got a birthday.

You know what I mean?

Yeah, I don't know.

Wouldn't that be great?

Here's the thing.

Every time I turn around it's 70's birthday.

Joe, do you have a birthday?

I don't have a birthday.

That's what you think about it.

No, I mean, I don't know.

Is that because you were adopted or because you just...

You don't know the date you were born?

It was just never a topic of conversation.

Like when were you born and all that stuff?

We were.

You were parents.

Did you know your parents?

I did.

Yeah, I knew my parents.

So when you heard about the children at school talking about their birthdays, you never thought, hey, that's something I should bring up to my parents.

I don't know.

Never occurred to me.

I just thought, oh, you got a birthday?

That's great.

Hey, you're so...

You know, that's always...

Can I answer any questions?

Do you have any siblings?

I don't have no.

I got no children.

Oh, only child.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

There's way more interesting things to talk about at the dinner table.

Yeah, you know, politics.

I think politics.

Sure.

Or whatever diabetes.

You know, let's talk about diabetes.

Oh, I'll say one second.

How often would you talk about diabetes?

Well, all the time it was a constant topic.

I bought my parents from diabetics.

And yeah, so...

Your parents were diabetics.

We both diabetics.

We talked a lot about that.

Did you ever have to, you know, inject them with you?

Oh, sure.

That would...

Yep, that's why I was part of the reason I became a health teacher.

I just had interest in health.

All we used to talk about...

How can people be healthier?

Poor venus.

Blood circulation.

We used to talk about...

Ustation II restrictions.

It was an issue my father had off and got ear infections.

Oh!

Hey!

Talk to me with the bongos.

Always had an ear infection, my father.

Oh, wow.

Chronic depression, alcoholism, yeah.

He had a lot of issues.

He was always trying to get into the army.

They wouldn't take him.

Always trying to get into the army.

Up to what point in his life?

He's still trying to get into the army.

Okay, so he's still alive.

He's six years old.

He'd like to serve.

Yeah.

Well, you know, that's impressive.

Yeah, that's a great instinct there to consider.

He goes, what is that?

He travels all around the country.

Sometimes all around the world, just to army bases and just tries to lend your hand.

Well, you know, you can serve your country and I guess the people love this country in other ways, other than the army or the armed forces, I would imagine.

You can volunteer at places that help others.

I wish I had thought of that as a thing to advise him of at some point.

Oh, that never came up.

No, he's just still trying to get out.

But you never had a birthday.

I never did have a birthday.

I don't know why.

You never blew up birthday candles?

No, not my own.

Oh, you didn't blow it.

So you used to go to birthday parties and blow on other things.

I didn't know how to do that.

You get impatient, you know, just didn't they dragging it out?

I, here's what I wonder.

As a health teacher, maybe you have a...

Yes.

I've been looking at people blowing on birthday cakes and Jason, this must just gross you out, right?

People blowing on candles.

I wonder what you would jerk in the sky.

You can think of all the spit on birthday cakes.

So gross.

It's gross, isn't it?

Like what a weird, like just...

Here's what I suggest.

Put the candles on a plate or something.

Let me do it this way.

Imagine how happy everybody is to receive a piece of cake that someone just spit all over.

And now imagine that right before putting your food down in front of you, a waitress or a waiter at a restaurant just blew on it.

Just blew it in kids.

Then put it down.

Would you be like, oh, cool.

That was like, here's your plate of curly fries.

Yeah.

Yeah, but she's a stranger.

I think the test for whether you should go to somebody's birthday party is am I comfortable eating their spit?

Am I intimate with this first?

Am I intimate enough with this person?

I'm comfortable eating this.

Have you been to a birthday party?

I've been to a lots of birthday parties.

Okay.

So how many?

So let's see.

Okay.

Well, I want to go back to 19.

Yeah, let's list them off.

This is good.

I would have had a birthday party while you have my aunt.

How old are you, by the way?

I'm right now.

Definitively?

I really don't know.

You don't know.

I really have no idea about how many times you've ever loved guests.

I feel like I do sound old.

How many July's have you encountered?

I wish I'd been keeping track of July's or any of the months.

That's the last time you were in school.

I have not, well, I work in school.

That's a hard one.

That's true.

How many years?

You know the concept of years?

2015, 2014.

I know that there's an old, there's an old, there's an earliest one you can remember.

There's one Christmas in a year and there's one Christmas in a year.

How many Christmas have you encountered?

How many Christmas?

I'm not keeping track of Christmas, you guys.

This is a real problem.

How many presidential elections?

How many presidents have you seen?

Oh, God.

Well, that's a great one.

The first guy I voted for was John Anderson.

That's a right in Camden Bend.

That's like the 80s.

That would have been, I don't know.

I don't know years.

See, okay.

Interesting.

What is the health of the tree?

He doesn't, he's not a math guy.

Sure, not a math guy.

You don't know how many Olympics have you seen?

Oh, wow.

We should have confused because they're certain if it was easier, if it was a more sensible breakdown between what's a winner game and what's a summer game.

How many long jumps?

Why are they playing basketball in the summertime?

That's...

Well, I mean, they started doing that, what, in 1988?

Is that what they started?

How many long jumps?

I guess we're going to have to just...

I have seen 18 long jump competitions.

Okay.

So every four years?

I think it's four.

64 years?

Yeah, somewhere in there.

Is there a 60?

I feel confident.

But sometimes these are semi-finals.

I don't know.

50, huh.

All right, but like old guy.

Ish.

You know what I always say?

But only as young as you feel.

You know, so I feel like I'm like 16, 17 years old.

I got a lot, you know what I mean?

I have a lot of energy.

Music must keep you young as well.

Yes!

Music keeps me young.

How long have you been playing these bongos?

I've been playing a bongos.

See, I found a pair of bongos under the pier and that had to be like...

In Marina Del Rey.

Down here in Marina Del Rey.

Are you born and raised?

No, I went all around the world.

I followed my dad from Army-based arm.

We were Army brats.

But he wasn't in the Army.

He was not in the Army.

He just tried to help out.

We were trying to get in there.

You would move to base town.

He wasn't the impression that you could...

If you got rejected at one place, you could go to another place.

He didn't realize it was a national...

It's all one Army.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So you must not have lived places for very long because he would...

I'm assuming instantly be rejected.

And then he would have moved for an hour and then you got a mat pack up and move again.

To the next Army-based...

He heard the expression you and what Army and took that literally thinking there were several different words.

He heard the expression you and what Army.

Don't try and figure that.

I don't care.

You know what?

I'm gonna go.

He's gonna say a lot of stuff that you're gonna need to gloss right over.

Come on now.

Otherwise, we will be ground into a nightmare.

I don't understand a lot of the things I hear.

And that's all right.

Hey, I got a wish for you.

Yep.

Okay.

You heard all the wish.

I did.

For one year, everywhere you go, here's my wish.

Yep.

For you to wear a denim shirt and a white cotton pair of pants.

It's so flipping it.

Turning it on its head.

I did consider...

I did consider for a while.

Summer...

Just before turning it on its head.

I'm gonna find out.

White jeans in a blue oxford.

I like it.

Yep.

And then later...

I own it.

I just have never worn it.

White jeans are problematic.

Don't you get them dirty and you gotta...

Oh, especially in the around the times I shit my pants.

Oh, yeah.

What?

Then white jeans are not for you.

If you were a frequent pants shitter, that would be advice.

Can I ask you a question, Joe Bongo?

You found this pair of Bongo's under the pier.

Do you know who they belong to or did you ever see a lost and found...

There was a guy sleeping next to them, but I didn't necessarily know, you know, those hiss or whatever.

You know, it's a very...

Now, was your name Joe Bongo at the time?

I was not going by Joe Bongo.

Okay, so this is a gnome de player, not a gnome de plume, but a stage name of some sort.

Well, I know.

I say, call me Joe Bongo because my thing is a bongo.

Does anybody call you Joe Bongo?

Everybody calls me Joe Bongo.

I certainly have.

I have to be over at school or whatever.

He's your Joe Bongo.

But you're not a music teacher, you're a health teacher.

Oh, yeah.

I'm a health teacher.

Do you incorporate the bongo's in your music in that sense, in that way of like, I know I'm aware that there are notes and I'm under the impression that there's sheet music, but I don't know it.

You're under the impression that there's...

So when can you confirm?

Do you think...

You can't do it immediately if you guys want.

Because we can probably produce sheet music just in case that's weighing on you at all.

What is saying?

That can be settled.

Look, there are great questions in life that we all wish we knew the answers to.

And it keeps us up at night.

We can answer this one for you.

That's because I've seen musicians and they got the music stand and something on there.

And I don't know if they're reading a magazine.

You can see the back of the paper.

I've only seen the back of the paper.

I've heard the term sheet music.

You're like, is that what you're doing?

Tap them on the shoulder and say, hey, you mind turning around and give me a look?

I give it a...

Because I don't want to go up there and interact with your performance or anything like that.

Did you study the bongo's?

Did you have lessons at all?

Are you self-taught?

Oh, I totally self-taught.

I'm an auto die-dact on the bongo's.

I've totally come just completely self-taught.

I picked up a few things that do drum circles down there.

I don't need to beat drum circles.

You would see and hear someone do something on the bongo's like a tip-tap-tap and you go, I've got to put that in there.

I could try that.

Tip-tap-tap.

Sure.

What is the basic principle, the guiding principle behind the bongo's?

You hit them and you tried to do it as many times within the beat as possible.

Oh, okay.

Well, I don't know.

Yeah, sure.

Crayamen is a lot into the beat.

Are there...

You're just going to feel it.

It's really a feeling.

You've got to know that you do.

You're going to feel it.

Let me lay down a beat and you show me the basic principles of the bongo's.

By the way, I take requests.

So any song requests you guys have.

I apply, I can play anything on the bongo's.

Oh, that's great.

That would be great.

I love that.

That's what I do.

You're so vain.

When I do parties, you're so vain.

Yeah.

See, I just feel it.

I feel like a Martin Denny tune.

I don't know if that was the first thing.

I felt the song and I just...

You definitely took on a different physicality when you played the bongo's.

Yeah, you...

You hunch over and you sort of become depressed and your eyes start to squint really, really hard.

Well, you know, I kind of put...

I go into a character in a way when I play bongo's.

You know what?

Who's that guy's name?

Jimmy Bongo.

Totally different guy.

Oh.

So when you're playing the bongo's, you're Jimmy Bongo.

I don't know.

Yeah, I guess.

I just...

We can adopt an attitude.

I adopt an attitude when I'm playing a bongo's.

It's great.

It must be great on stage.

Do you ever perform live?

Oh, sure I do.

I'm a band right now.

We're called Rose Bush Red and it's me and it's a bunch of the students at the high school.

And I'm always...

Oh, like a rock and roll combination?

Yes, it's a rock and roll combination band.

Yeah, that's a bongo guy and I put the band together.

You put the band together.

I've been at this school now for many years.

I don't know how many Christmases or Olympics it's been, but it's been a lot of long time because a lot of the kids have come and gone, you know, sure.

Well, I bet some have passed away.

Probably, sure.

As a matter of fact, I know.

Yes.

It's a number of them have.

Mm-hmm.

Drunk driving.

So you know a number of them.

So you have more certainty as to student deaths than the existence of sheet music.

I have been alive for 33 student deaths.

It could have all been in one year.

There could be one bus accident.

Yeah.

No.

I don't want to talk about that.

Because I'm parking lot security and it's my job.

Oh.

You know, it's one of the things.

So you are a man of many interests or many responsibilities.

I pick up a few extra dollars to parking lot security and you know, really.

Sure.

So you're cooler.

That's like right when the final bell rings.

You hustle on over there to the parking lot.

Great question.

I'm there in the morning and I'm there in the afternoon.

Morning and afternoon.

Oh, and just like that.

Look at that.

At 6 p.m.

You punch out or?

I can leave there.

When do I leave?

I don't even know because I don't have a watch.

But I leave when it feels like there's nothing else going on.

Yeah, there's not a lot happening in the parking lot.

I just get out of there.

Do you ever like kids hang out in the parking lot?

Oh, sure.

Is it like a scene?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I would imagine sometimes the moon is really high and just like, you know, you're there till 1, 2 a.m.?

Well, you know what's weird?

There's different times of the year when it gets darker earlier.

So you can't necessarily...

We know.

We know a lot about time.

Do you?

We have watches and yeah.

Do you?

I don't have one.

Do you have a sundial at all?

No, I don't even know what time.

How do you show up to work on time?

I don't really.

I mean, in the sense of...

Just whenever it feels like you should be there.

Well, yeah, the sense of relative to other people.

You know what I mean?

I don't show up necessarily.

Do you live by the school in Happenoculars and when you start to see people trickle in, you go, oh, I got to get there.

No, that would be a great idea.

I just kind of...

I wake up and I do what feels like I have to do at home, which is sometimes, you know, eat something or whatever, you know, put on pants.

And then I go and I just...

Sometimes I'm there hours early, you know.

I mean, there's so much earlier before anybody else.

Sure.

A lot of time I'm there, you know.

Way later.

The bandstand.

And it just takes a little longer than you thought.

Well, hey, if you don't have a clean pair of pants, sure.

You gotta go down to the laundry mat.

Oh, yeah.

You gotta putter around looking for...

Yeah.

Can I ask you one question before we get to the band?

You become Jimmy Bongo's when you play.

Well, I just said that.

And yes, Joe Bongo is your stage name.

Why didn't you just pick Jimmy Bongo's?

It's not like that.

What do you mean?

I'm what I'm saying is, there's the me that I am every day and who teaches a health class and who plays Bongo's a little.

That Joe Bongo.

That's Joe Bongo.

Okay.

But then...

But he sounds like a real square almost compared to this Jimmy Bongo.

Oh, well, man.

Yeah, right.

That's true.

And I adopt an attitude.

I become kind of a like a Bongo.

Sure.

Jimmy Bongo's wouldn't be a health teacher.

No, Jimmy...

Forget it.

No way.

Jimmy Bongo's all day.

All that is the Bongo's.

Yeah.

One further question.

Why is Jimmy Bongo's pluralized?

And Joe Bongo is not.

That's a great question.

And I don't know the answer.

Okay.

That's what's great about it.

And that's what's interesting about you that I'm enjoying is just like...

You have like a real lust for life, it seems like, as long as you...

You have to play lust for life?

That's a real song that...

Yeah.

That I can...

Yeah.

I get it.

There are certain songs you can pick out by their drums.

Yep.

Like, come together.

Can you do come together?

Yeah.

That's what I mean.

Yeah.

I mean...

You've got a few more ways of course.

Wipe out.

Yeah.

Wipe out.

I'm really tired.

Wow.

That was cool.

You can barely play this song before getting tired.

So tired.

Yeah.

It seems like you just got real tired.

I'm really tired.

Yeah.

I'm really tired.

Yeah.

I'm really tired.

Wow.

That was cool.

You can barely play this song before getting tired.

So tired.

Yeah.

It seems like you just got real tired.

You just went in there.

You laid down on the floor and pulled the microphone all the way down.

You should take a little nap.

Oh.

What's the time for nap?

Is there a nap time?

Of course.

That's part of this part.

Yeah.

It's usually don't do nap time in the middle.

Not at part of the part.

That would just be 45 minutes for just silence I think.

Yeah.

Well, you could fast forward pass it.

I guess so, but that's a lot of data.

It's me putting into people's iPhones.

That was...

That was really satisfying.

You know, like iPhones.

I'm tired of these iPhones all the time.

Oh, you and Andrew again?

No, I'm not an Android guy.

He's not asking if you're an Android.

I'm not an Android and I'm tired of the question.

Why is everyone asking me this off?

I don't know, but it comes up a lot.

Are you an Android?

I'm not an Android.

I rap because you know what it is?

It's part of the experience of certain times of the year.

I rap my torso in taint foil just to keep warm.

And it is like warm.

What's...

What's the...

What times of years?

What...

Doing those times of the year that when the sun is not up as long is when it gets darker earlier.

Okay, say that.

I think that tin foil.

I guess it probably would.

Yeah, that is cold winter.

Yeah, Christmas is around then.

Huh?

Christmas is around then?

Sometimes I got tin foil on my torso on Christmas day.

Okay.

And it piques out from behind a shirt and you get to all your stuff.

Do people think you're a present?

They try to unwrap you?

I've...

Listen, it's been a long time since I've been unwrapped.

I'll tell you that right now.

Do you have a family?

Do you have a partner?

No!

I don't.

I was married for a little while.

But the problem is you cannot wear a wedding ring if you're a bongo player.

So it's not possible.

It's just basically not possible to be married if you...

You could just take the ring off while you're playing bongo.

Wear the ring around your neck maybe as a symbol of your body.

Here's the issue.

Yes, I was married and I had a wedding ring.

And whenever I played bongo I said I took off the ring.

You got it.

And then it's like it's open season on me.

Then you drip and then push it.

Yeah, that's the problem.

And it's like girls, you know, it's a deadly combination of bongo...

You know, let's face it.

It's pretty sexy.

The bongo is a sexy instrument.

And you don't have a wedding ring on your finger.

You're gonna get fucked.

But Joe, let me ask you this.

Oh, all right.

Is that a proper language for a health teacher?

It does sound like primarily you are playing to high schools.

Sure.

Most of the time, I do go down the pier.

But a lot of the time, yeah.

So that provides a whole other set of problems if you are an unmarried man.

Well...

And you're always getting...

Dripping and pushing.

If you're always talking to me.

If you're talking to me.

Look, I don't know.

Like from one tank talker to another.

You want to talk to me?

Has this started to be coming up such a talking tank?

Is this the pilot?

Slowly, slowly establishing this as a backdoor pilot for talking tank.

I'll talk to you.

If we're talking tank...

It must be almost...

Because Jimmy Bongo's is one of the most erotically charged people I've ever seen.

Oh, no doubt about it.

I mean, no doubt.

I'm not gonna argue about it.

Like you Joe Bongo.

We have lies in our heads.

We can see it.

I'm not gonna be talking to you.

The assumption is that if you brought a gas mask to school, you know you're gonna need it.

Number 10.

There we go.

Bongo versus Bongo's.

And people don't know.

Andy actually had Bongo's that he brought into the studio.

Oh yeah, he's playing them constantly.

Yeah.

Also, what you might not be...

You missed in this clip.

Classic Charles stopped by.

Classic Charles did come by.

You are listed as one of the performers on this episode.

That bugs people.

That bugs people because...

Like you wasn't really in it.

Because people get excited.

They go, a Zooks PFT Andy Daily episode?

That's great.

And then you're just in there for a second doing Classic.

If you don't know what Classic Charles is, listen to the comedy bang bang DVD commentary that actually is coming out in a week or two or something like that.

Is it really?

But only made to order on Amazon, I think.

But it will have extras and everything.

This will have the...

These are the last extras they're ever going to commission.

Pfft.

Unfortunately.

They're not commissioning them for season four or five.

But I'm doing it myself.

And I'm going to put them out somewhere down the line myself.

Well, there you go.

What's the point of being an eccentric millionaire if you can't pay for your own DVD extras?

Ah!

But yeah, that was a great...

Of course, after this clip, it gets demented when we find that Jimmy Bongo's is an entirely different personality from Joe Bongo and perhaps a murderous one at that.

Oh!

Took it's...

Cher and I wasn't expecting.

But that's a great episode that...

I'm happy to see that's so high.

I kind of thought it might get overlooked.

That was a really funny episode.

Yeah.

A really, really funny episode.

Alright, we have to take two breaks.

We have to take two breaks.

Me hitting you and you hitting the floor.

You breaking the floor.

Breaking the floor.

Oh, you did a little bit of a spin?

I'm doing...

Yeah, doing breaking the law.

Sure.

Parity.

We need to take two breaks.

We'll be right back with more comedy banging after this.

Comedy banging.

We're back here with Paul F. Tomkins.

Those are two good breaks.

And I believe we probably did do two breaks on measure.

I bet we did.

Welcome back.

We've cracked the top ten and rightfully so.

Who better than us?

We've cracked them.

Like it's a case we had to solve.

Yeah, it was a cold case.

Who better than us?

One of these top ten going to be...

We got to get this in the black.

Scott, I feel like we're like the Sherlock and Watson of cracking.

Who am I?

Who would you like to be?

I don't want to be Sherlock.

He's so cool.

I think you have to be because you're taller.

He's a heroin addict.

That is cocaine addict.

Oh, I thought it was a heroin as well.

Well, it was the seven percent solution.

I'm not sure.

It was cocaine and heroin, I think.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

The speedball, as they call it.

The famous Marvel character, speedball.

Did they ever...

Based on that?

No, it wasn't based on that.

Cloak and Dagger, though.

They were...

Oh, that's right.

They took drugs to get their power.

They were in the inner city.

Did they take drugs to get their powers?

Yeah.

They did, yeah.

Oh, I thought they were less...

Like, limitless, too.

I want that pill.

Give me that pill.

Hey, gay.

You gave me that pill.

Analyze this in that.

There's a commercial now for that movie, Joy, where...

I guess David O'Russle is just like...

It's the inside-out spin-off movie, right?

Yeah.

David O'Russle is just like...

I don't want to have to worry about casting anymore.

Just the same people all the time.

Same people.

Remember, you saw this last year?

You're seeing it again.

Now they have different beards and wigs.

Yeah, but that's the only difference.

But there's a...

In the trailer at one point, Robert, you know, it's like, I'm proud of you.

I got to admit, I'm proud of you.

I'm proud.

Is that the very first...

Let's say...

Is that the very first line I wonder?

I don't...

Oh, I hope it is.

Because I don't want to see, like, someone's emotional arc resolved in the trailer.

You know what I mean?

You want...

What if it's like, it starts off?

It starts off on proud of you.

And then he learns to not be proud.

Why?

He learns to be ashamed.

I'm ashamed of you.

I learned, you know what I learned through this process?

Give me that pill.

All right, we have to get to your next episode on the countdown list.

Oh, man, this is making me laugh.

The idea of it.

I'm going to take a drug and be smart.

And now it's a TV show, right?

Yeah, it's a TV show.

Boy, oh boy.

All right, this is your number nine.

Number nine.

All right, this is from June 4th.

June 4th, this is episode 354.

Oh, 354.

What could it be?

This is an episode called Solo Bolo Doselo.

Oh shit.

And let me explain this a little bit.

The solo Bolo, the first solo Bolo episode was in our top 10 last year, I believe.

And that was Ben Schwartz and I.

Usually you heard from him a little earlier in the countdown.

Usually we do...

So don't be a dick.

You heard from him earlier.

Come on, guys.

Who he is.

Jesus.

The voice of BB-8.

Come on.

I got balls.

She's got the one ball.

He's got two balls.

He's got a ball on top of his head.

That's not a ball.

He thinks that's a ball.

He's just a ball.

Well, because of the shape of it, it's not like a true...

It's like a half ball.

It's like a growth on a ball.

Half ball.

It's like if you had that in your test...

If you had a BB-8 in your test, you'd be like, Doc, cut it out.

Stop joking around.

And fix my balls.

Fix my balls.

Why do they not...

They could have had me do the voice of BB-8.

Yeah, why Ben and not you?

Why was that not a perfect audition?

I'm not right.

I got a roll on out of here.

Honestly, I think it's the Jews sticking together.

If you know what it means.

You know what I'm saying, JJ and Ben.

You know what it means?

Juju Abrams.

And Juju.

And you know Ben's real name?

Ben Schwartzstein.

He shortened it to sound less Jewish.

Oh my gosh.

Boy, if I see him again, he's going to get an earful.

Anti-Semitism?

Yes.

Great.

From me, the biggest anti-Semite in the world.

Man, this is anti-Semite.

She's gorgeous.

It's like Santa Claus where they...

Yeah, someone takes his name and then they give anti-Semite toys every year.

What?

Well, when I hear Mrs. Anti-Semite, it's like Mrs. Claus.

That was the opening to heart to heart.

Oh, when they got together, it was murder.

Yeah.

That's my boss, Mr. H. He's quite a guy.

That was a bold TV move.

That was a TV show from a lady.

He showed from a lady.

To have a secondary character, but also to hire a guy who was clearly going to drop dead any moment.

We were going to make him a major character.

Did he drop dead in the middle of the filming?

I think he made it.

Was it coach situation?

I think he made it the whole run of the show.

Wow.

Sometimes I think about that when you, like, you know, they're like, oh my god, we got this amazing actor.

He's 90.

That's like...

That's like, court went through two old ladies before they were like, well, let's get someone.

Yeah.

Let's get someone young.

Jeremy.

Kevin.

Jeremy.

Kevin.

Jeremy.

Kevin.

When to you.

T.A.

Oh, yeah.

All right, you know what people said when the entourage movie came out?

Oh, no.

No.

Mr. Belvedere style.

No.

Hey, that was 2015, the year that was.

This is best week ever.

Paul of Tomkins.

What was 2015?

The entourage movie.

You believe it, dear?

Mr. Belvedere also 2015.

Mr. Belvedere reboot.

Mr. Belvedere is it not on balls.

Freaks on the China.

They put like a little scratching behind it.

So solo bolo, what is it?

Ben Schwartz, when he is on the show, we usually do a segment before the character comes on of Just Us Riffing.

And one day he said, why don't we do the whole show like this?

And thus, a solo bolo was born.

How did that happen?

Had the first one.

How did it happen?

Because it was just the two of you.

It was just the two of us.

Yeah.

And was it that he suggested it in another episode?

In another episode, he said we should do a whole episode like this and call it a solo bolo.

And then, well, cut to the first solo bolo, I say, and you named it the solo bolo and you said, no, I didn't.

Now cut to this solo bolo, Doselo, which is the second solo bolo, I retell that story and he's like, oh, did I name it?

And then I told the story and he goes, I don't think I named it.

He's like, he can't get a like a grip on reality.

This guy, I think he is detached from reality.

He's a mane.

I think he's mentally ill.

I do believe that he should be in a rubber room.

I do believe that he should be an old.

I'll say, I'll say.

All right, so solo bolos, basically, all they are is just me, Ben, trapped in a room, a lot of ripping.

Trapped in a room.

We are trapped.

It's like a, yeah.

It's a locked door situation.

Yeah, it's a locked room mystery as well.

We try to solve a mystery by the end.

Is it like one of those escape rooms?

Yeah, exactly.

It was a long, complicated puzzle that if either of us can solve, we can get out.

But instead, we just decide to do a show.

We sing a lot, and this particular solo bolo doe slow goes off the rails immediately within the first few minutes with the second of two word stumbles I made in episodes this year, which turned into t-shirts.

So this was the second of these, and you'll hear it.

Oh, this was, this is the second.

This is the second one.

I thought this was first.

It was, you're right.

Yeah.

It was the first one.

Oh, yeah.

Baking a plane cake.

All right.

This was the first one.

You're right.

So we made a t-shirt out of this.

You'll hear it right from the jump here.

It's one of the first things that happens.

Here we are.

This is your number nine.

Number nine.

Let's get ready to rumble.

I'll joke you sound a salad.

Look at a salad.

Oh, I knew a t-shirt.

I knew a t-shirt was born.

And then this moment, a t-shirt was born.

All joking is a salad.

And then it just has a picture of a salad.

The last thing you see for John Ralphio is he fakes his own death.

Yes, of course.

And then he starts a casino into Jekistan.

Yes.

The parks in the game, the eight people wrap gifts and they found.

Oh, that sounds so nice for you.

They're very nice.

And they found some extra ones because I'm not main cast there.

And they're like, we actually have some for you.

And so a person came by to drop it off.

Who is this person?

This person, I believe, was Mike Schur's assistant.

And what is Mike Schur's assistant's name?

You know what?

I don't know.

A person drops a present off for you.

Oh, at the time I did, I invited her inside and everything.

Oh, really?

How long did she say?

About two days.

What'd you do to this woman?

God.

Can she do what I do when I get a woman to myself?

Yeah, let's go.

Okay.

Here we go.

All right, Benny's going to tell us what he does do a woman.

What I do, try to get a woman to my place, try to lock that door real quick so she can't get a boy, right?

And then this guy will pretend you're the girl.

I'll be like, hey, baby, how are you?

Hi, baby.

I love you, I'm pucks and bread.

Oh, thank you.

Why do you want to do this?

My first of all, how old are you?

I'm two.

I'm this many.

Two?

I'm this many.

Little baby, you know I like them young.

Who baby?

I like them young.

Oh, baby.

I like them young.

My name's Maggie Simpson.

We're back.

We're back, baby.

Everybody saying it again.

Oh, oh, oh.

Oh, oh.

Oh, oh, oh.

10 roaf.

Rested.

Get it fixed.

Seriously.

So she comes by and she gives me the little bag of trinkets for the thing and she goes.

What is it?

Actually, it was a lot of really, it was, I believe.

A few links?

No, Nick Offerman in his wood shop made a out of a piece of wood he carved something to look like Indiana and then he stamped where Pawnee would have been on it and in the back, it said from the crew or from the cast or whatever.

It's kind of interesting, don't you think that Chris Pratt, he spends so much time in Indiana, but he's signing up to spend more time in Indiana?

I'm sorry?

Jones, of course.

That's why it's the Hollywood Reporter.

Jones, that is.

Not making mention of this.

That's a great, by the way, would you stop doing headlines?

Let me get, wait, first, let me tell you the prop, then I wouldn't play our headline game.

I would send in headlines so many times.

Okay, I know.

I'm going to give you news, news items and you're going to give me a headline for them.

Okay.

Meaning what?

I'm going to give you the story and you give me the New York Post version of that headline because that was a great one.

Indiana goes back.

But so they come by and she goes, there's one more thing Mike, Mike Duggan-Mork if wanted you to have.

It took off her beautiful breasts, really sweet girl.

And so she goes, it's in the trunk will you help me get it out?

It's in the trunk.

And I was like, okay, and we take out the gravestone of John Ralphio and she goes, they go, they wanted you to have it.

They don't need it.

Yeah.

And I was like, amazing.

So in my apartment, which is not very huge, I have the tomb son of John Ralphio.

And by the way, it was special effects.

So it's actually like eight feet tall.

Eight feet tall.

Yeah.

They made it like a giant.

It's a lot of real estate.

Yeah, I had to take out my fucking ceiling.

Okay, this is the story.

I'm going to give you a story.

Here we go.

And then you give me the funny headline.

All right.

Okay, ready?

Inside of a zoo one day, all the monkeys got out of their cages and ate all the food and all the pedestrians ran away.

Okay.

What's the headline?

Bananas no longer.

Slippery pedestrian slip on out of zoo.

Okay, so I'm in a mistake.

You're terrible at this.

You got lucky.

This is my first attempt at it.

Huge.

It's a huge headline.

Boy, you're so good at it.

Give me any one.

Give me a different sort.

All right, here we go.

Watch this.

Engineer Sam, get off your phone.

You're going to hear this.

All right, here we go.

At the airport.

Already got a great one.

Keep going.

All right.

I'm going to do the Pentagon.

Just shy.

No, I do that.

None of your funny headlines.

You're so good at.

Yeah, I didn't think so.

I said a couple of monkeys came out of their cages.

What about a trader?

A trader publishes secrets though onto on to wicky leaks and flees to Russia.

America's biggest trader.

Make a funny headline out of that.

Sure.

Snowed in.

Kids are no longer snowed in.

I was going to say.

Go, the Olympic challenge.

All right, the Olympic music challenge.

One of us starts to sing a song.

It can be any song.

Real song?

Doesn't have to be real song.

These all have to be real songs.

It doesn't have to be from musical.

It can be a pop song.

It can be a musical song.

It can be anything.

The other person tries to join along and at the natural conclusion of the other.

The other person song.

The other person has to segue seamlessly into a new song.

I love this.

And whoever stops, whoever loses the line, can't think of another song.

And if you don't know the words exactly, try to keep on.

That's fine.

It's fine.

Not knowing the words.

Just basically all it is is just trying to.

Is this the first time you ever played this?

It's the first time we've ever played this.

Can we name it after solo bolo?

Okay, let's call it solo bolo Olympic song challenge.

Great.

All right, here we go.

It's time for solo bolo Olympic song challenge.

Starring Scott, Aukerman, and.

Thank you.

Thank you so much for saying who's starring in it because a lot of times we don't do that.

Of course.

Yeah, well, when this is on the best of them, I won't be able to know.

Okay, here we go.

So do you want to start with a song?

Or should I start with a song, right?

Yes, I'll start with a song, right?

Okay, here we go.

Can you feel the love tonight?

Can you feel it has to be a little more than that.

Oh, I'm sorry.

That's good.

I feel like we should.

Okay, right.

Here we go.

Can't go that quickly.

Look, kuna matata.

What a wonderful phrase.

A kuna matata.

Ain't no passing craze.

It means no worries for the rest of your days.

Kuna matata.

Do do do do do do do do do do do do.

Maybe far away or maybe real nearby.

He'll be blurring her coffee.

She'll be straightening his time.

Maybe in a house.

Or maybe by a hill.

He'll be eating a salad.

She'll be riding her will.

Maybe the sisters are.

Maybe they're cool.

Maybe they went to drive it.

Somewhere over the rainbow.

Well, up high there's a land that I dream of.

Once in a lullaby, feed the birds.

Top ends are bad.

Chim chimney, chim chimney, chim chim.

Jouroo.

I'm a little bit of a kid.

It's all right.

Very nice.

And that is one of the best ways to get full circle that I've ever heard.

That is an improv game.

Yeah, that's like wow.

As long as you always start on who Koonamata and Don't be happy, you're going to be fine.

Yeah, you're okay.

Whatever you say in the middle, it doesn't matter.

Well there it is.

He predicted it.

The solo solo Olympic song challenge was in the best of.

I think he was kidding when he said it.

The T-shirt.

I don't think he was kidding when he said it.

I think he was hearing it back.

I think he was kidding.

Like, oh boy, yeah.

Because we were about to do it.

Like, oh yeah, I just want to know what it's called when it's in the best of.

I think he's doing that on purpose.

Yeah, maybe so.

But yeah, the T-shirt of course is all joking a salad.

We made the T-shirts.

I like to imagine someone wearing a T-shirt and explaining it to someone else.

Yes, I don't know that I'm imagining someone has to have explained.

If you have explained it to someone, please write their reaction to us and send it to us on Twitter and say, yeah, I explained it.

Oh, let me write the reaction blank there.

Yeah, very simple.

Yep, there.

I'm going to do some keyboard clicks.

All right, we have to get to our next episode on the countdown.

We have two guys.

This is your number eight.

Number eight.

All right.

B-B-H-T-B-8.

This is episode 377.

This is, I believe, no, this is not our latest episode in the countdown.

This is September 21.

Pretty close though.

Do you remember what you were doing in September and perhaps what this episode could be?

Let's see.

What happens in September every year?

Back to school.

Back to school, of course, but once those kitties are off to school, we can enjoy the Emmys.

That's right.

And we do.

And we do every year.

Kids are at school, so the grownups can watch the Emmys.

Go off to school, young lad.

I need to watch a four-hour show about television.

But when the Emmys come around, quite often we are blessed with people who are coming into town just for the Emmys and they want to do an episode of the show.

Scott, you're absolutely right.

And I think I know which episode this is going to be.

This year was no exception because this is an episode called Goodnight in the Morning.

Oh, yes it is.

Your episode number eight.

All right.

Tatiana Maslani and Christian Bruin from Orphan Black.

They are both big fans of the show.

They listen to it every week from what I understand.

They tweet about it constantly.

I didn't, I did not know this.

But I had been watching Orphan Black and was like, oh wow, those guys are awesome.

And then suddenly started receiving tweets from them.

I'm like, I think they listened to the show or something.

And then they were constantly tweeting about it for a while.

And they were like, you know, retweeting us whenever we would tweet about the show.

And we slowly started to realize that they were fans.

I met them both when they came to the San Diego Comic Con show that we did that's in the Howl app right now with that we did with Taren Kilum and some other people.

Derek Waters.

Derek Waters and also who else was there?

Me.

You.

That's right.

Were you, is that really who you were blanking on?

You were like, big tree for people on stage.

You're like, the Taren Kilum.

I've done a hundred episodes this year.

I can't remember the details of them all.

Well, no, I was getting a confused with the outside Lance one quite honestly.

I kept going.

Quite honestly.

So we both met them at the San Diego Comic Con show.

And what did they come dressed as?

They came dressed as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Yes.

Full costume and masks.

They, they, they assumed because it was at Comic Con that there would be people in costumes there at the theater.

This was a little off site.

This was away from, this is maybe five miles away from the convention center.

Yes, this was.

And it was mainly San Diego locals, I believe were at the show.

Not tied into Comic Con in any way.

They were the only people dressed up.

And you and I really encouraged them to come without telling them that.

But I wondered if they also had those costumes because they wanted to be able to walk around on notice.

I think they did, but also.

Because they would have been mobbed.

Maybe.

Although I think they took off the masks at a certain point.

Oh, they would have been mobbed on the Comic Con floor.

Definitely.

Yeah.

So they came as Ninja Turtles.

We took pictures with them.

We talked to them.

We saw them the next day.

Lovely people.

I didn't see them that night though.

You didn't see them.

You didn't meet them until the next day.

Oh, okay.

You met them the next day.

I met them the next day at Comic Con.

And some, it was like some weird holding area where I was there with a thrilling venture hour.

And we did some signings and we did like, there's this whirlwind photo thing where they have in this suite of rooms.

Right.

They have different photographers for different media outlets or whatever.

Nothing that I've been invited to.

And so.

Really?

Yeah.

Well, I don't understand that.

But they, you were just kind of taken from one room to another.

Right.

And you very quickly take a bunch of pictures and then that's it.

Mr. Tompkins.

No one is doing that.

Oh, by the way.

Look here, Mr. Tompkins.

The photographers are all like, I don't know who the fuck these people are.

I'll find out later.

Why am, why are you wasting, why are you making me do this?

That's how I feel when I do.

I, I, I am encouraged to walk red carpets a lot these days.

There is, it's humiliating.

It's humiliating because you see the person going up and whispering in their ear.

Yes.

This is cockerman comedy bang bang.

They write it down to take a note of it.

And then I imagine the minute I walk past them, they go, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete, delete of all of their pictures.

No, I, I honestly think they're like, all right, I guess I'll hold on to this.

If I find out this person is somebody.

Right.

You never are.

Right.

But it is, I've like seen people put cameras down.

It's mortifying.

Camera's down everyone.

Mumpkins is here.

Oh, we don't have to worry about this guy.

So in, so there's this room in between where you can hang out, in between room.

Yeah.

And you can hang out there and have as many red bowls and kind bars as you want.

Oh boy.

And so that's where I met Tatiana and Christian.

They, like I turned around and they were walking towards me and they, it was adorable.

They had the biggest smiles on their faces.

Like it was as if we were pen pals and we had been corresponding.

We're finally meeting for the first time in person.

Except it had been one sided in a lot of way.

I mean, you know, we watch, we watch Orphan Black.

Yeah, I've seen the show, but I, I never talked to them in any way.

Maybe once on like that weekend on Twitter or something, they were the sweetest people and they were clearly like huge comedy fans.

Yeah.

So it's Canadian, Canadian.

Canadians, that's the only thing that explained.

There's, there's such a, well, honestly, I really do think that's what it is because there's such a strong, there's such a strong comedic sensibility in Canada because they're a big country with a relatively small population.

Right.

And their comedy scene is insanely strong.

Right.

For the amount of people that populate their country.

They love to laugh.

They got nothing better to do up there too.

But they produce great comedy, but also I think they produce great comedy fans.

Yes.

And we've, we found that out when we went up to Toronto recently.

Yes.

Not recently, but a year, a year or so ago and hopefully we will be back very soon.

And those guys are both very funny in their own right.

And they're, and their storyline, because Tatiana obviously plays a million characters.

Yeah.

If you, if you've not watched Orphan Black, you really should.

It's a tour de force from her and Christian does pretty well too.

Hi, Christian.

He only plays one guy.

Yes.

She plays like 12 different people and they're all wildly different.

Yeah.

But the character she plays with Christian is the, is, I think kind of you could say that's the comic relief.

Yeah.

She's the uptight housewife, suburban housewife who was in a musical and the musical was so good.

Yeah.

Like they have a lot of fun together because she's playing the comic relief character and he's sort of playing the comic relief character.

Although, you know, you know, he still has a lot of stuff going on.

It's a little dark.

Don't want to spoil anything.

I want that pill.

We will spoil that he wants the pill.

That's the one thing we will.

He does want the pill.

He does want it.

But so anyway, so when the Amys came around, they work in Toronto.

That's where they, they film were from black.

When the Amys came around, I had been hearing, oh yeah, they're big fans or through the publicist, oh, they'd like to do the show at some point or something.

When the Amys came around, you have to understand when you are an Emmy nominated actress and you are coming into town just for the Amys, your schedule is packed.

Yes.

They pack it with as much promo as possible in order to capitalize on the availability of being there and they're trying to get your name out there as much as possible in order to maybe garner a win or at least just garner publicity for the show.

So these guys did not have time to do this, one would think.

They put aside two hours of their day and as they told their publicist who's a good friend of mine, it was something they really, really wanted to do.

So they absolutely made time for it.

So this was the episode.

They were big fans.

And by the way, I'd first heard that Tatiana was such a big fan when she met Lauren Lapkis at a SAG Awards thing, I think, when Lauren had said hi to Andy Samberg and they did the episode where we all did the Hollywood facts theme over and over and over again.

And Tatiana made a beeline for them and started doing the Hollywood facts theme too.

So Lauren wrote to me and said, hey, Tatiana Muslinny is a big fan of the show.

So that's where I first heard about it.

So I knew I had to get Lauren, I knew I had to get you.

And so this is an episode called Goodnight in the Morning.

Oh, we haven't gotten to the clip yet?

No, we haven't done the clip yet.

You and Lauren hadn't really decided what you were going to do before the episode.

Not at all.

Not, I don't, neither of a sudden.

Or, Norton, did you think you were going to do it together?

No, we did not have separate plans of characters to do and you were living separate lives.

Yeah.

You have no rights to ask me.

How I feel you have no rights.

This is the perfect key for this song.

The lowest version.

You've got no rights.

You want the maximum drama of this song.

You have no right to ask me how I feel.

You've got no right to speak to me.

What is funny here?

Starting too high or starting too low?

Because I think starting too low is underrated.

I think it's underrated.

We both were like, oh boy, should have taken that up quite a bit.

I was like, oh boy, I'm a bad guy.

So we, it was right before, right before we started recording and I said, do you want to do something together?

And she said, sure.

And I said, what should we be?

And she said, let's be Morning DJs.

And that was it.

That was the only preparation that we...

Morning DJs.

And I think you said what your names were.

They ended up being Chasmin.

Chasmin and something.

That's right.

We talked to you guys for a while.

For a huge, you changed your voice midway.

Yes, because I started doing it.

There was a thing in my head that I was going for, but when it came out, because I wanted to do like...

Like cheesy Morning DJs.

Yeah, well there's a certain type of voice where these guys sound like, they really sound horse and raw.

Right.

Like they've been doing Coke all night and then they have this Morning Radio show.

Right.

And it was not coming out right and it sounded way too much.

Like Tom, like James and James.

James and Domi and Tom Lucas.

And so I...

The Twitter credit, you switched it up.

It was all I could think about was like, this isn't what I want to do.

Yeah, so at maybe 10 minutes in you cleared your throat and then you did the voice that ended up ending up in Eric's sounding voice.

I put it to his plate.

Look how high it is.

It's number eight.

No, I think the things that we were saying was funny.

If I had had more time to prepare, I probably would have done a more specific voice.

Sure.

But hey, you'd beacers can't be choosers.

No, and I was big.

You were all beggars.

No one would let me choose.

So we talked to Chasmin and Sunny for a while and then their producer, Scarzdale, came in and this is your number eight.

Number eight.

So good night.

Good morning.

Is it called Good Night in the Morning because you wrap up at night?

Yes.

No.

I don't know.

It's called Good Night in the Morning because the show starts in the morning.

It goes all goddamn day.

Then at night time, someone puts a cover over us so we know it's time to go to sleep.

Get our cake.

Pour some night.

We do the show at a giant cake.

We get shot tonight.

It's over.

Good night.

That's right.

I can't keep this carpet over you or this rug or whatever.

Blank it.

No one ever said it was a carpet or a rug.

Blank it is a little bit closer.

But I know that there's a language difference because we're from different countries.

Sorry, we got Blank it's carpet.

Yeah.

Like your security carpet.

Yeah, exactly.

Like Linus.

What was the question?

Oh, who does it?

It's our producer Scarsdale.

Is Scarsdale here?

Of course he is.

He's always with us all the time.

He's like a langer.

Bring a letter I should say.

All right.

Here comes Scarsdale.

Hello.

Hi, Scarsdale.

Hello.

I am Scarsdale.

Hello.

I am Scarsdale.

You have an interesting phenomenon going on with your voice here.

Oh, really?

What do you think my voice sounds like?

It sounds like two people are talking at the same time.

Do you have two tracheas and larynxes?

Do I have two tracheas and larynxes?

No.

Well, then what accounts for this strange phenomenon I'm hearing?

I just sound like me to me.

Well, it's, you know, I've heard of people with six octave voices, but you're literally speaking, I think, two octaves in two totally separate octaves.

Oh, you know what it is?

I'm Tibetan.

Oh, I see.

You're like breathing in while you're breathing out and that thing.

Right.

I'm doing that all the time.

Okay.

Very good, Scarsdale.

How did you meet these two?

How did I be sunny?

It's interesting because occasionally and very rarely I have to say you sound as if your two voices are not saying the word that the other voice is saying.

Well, I don't know what you're talking about in the first place, so I don't know why it would sound.

Your Tibetan breathing sort of lapsed there for a second.

These guys, this guy, Scarsdale.

He's quite a character.

We make fun of him.

We make fun of him all the time.

We hate him.

We can't stand him.

Get hooked up with this guy.

Oh, he followed us home.

That's right.

We were leaving the studio the first day we did the show without a producer.

And I remember, I remember walking home to the home we share.

Well, we don't.

We're not married, but we are roommates.

We are.

Did you call him husband early?

Uh-oh.

I didn't say that.

No, I don't think.

I actually think she did not say that.

Okay, it sounded like that.

I didn't.

I know I didn't.

Good night.

So he followed you home and the rest is history.

Yes, well, yeah, he follows over.

You're not curious.

I am.

It seemed like you were moving on.

No, it seemed like you were done with hearing this story.

I've never done you with hearing your story.

The right way, however, to address your comment, the rest is indeed history.

Okay, everything is.

But yeah, Scarsdale followed us home.

And what were you thinking, Scarsdale?

Why follow these two home?

I wanted to break into the radio business.

That makes sense.

So you wanted to break into the radio business.

So then Sonny, what, I mean, you see a...

I thought he was going to say I wanted to break into their home.

That's what I thought he was going to say.

I thought he sounded like that little guy from Twin Peaks.

Oh.

Rewind?

That is me?

That's right.

Little Rewind from Twin Peaks.

I hope he makes it to the new episodes that are coming to sit back.

Showtime!

Somebody stop me.

Time to know money.

So we followed you home.

Did I do that?

You got it, dude.

Not the mama.

What was your question?

Followed you home and then broke into the house or just stood outside.

We leave the Dora Jar because we're both very afraid of suffocating in our own home.

Okay, which seems like you'd be more afraid of burglars or a home invasion.

I would rather be struggling with my sleep by a burglar than suffocate because I left the door closed.

I don't know how you feel about it, Sonny.

The same.

You know that.

That was a trick question.

Razzle-dazzle.

Well, I know these guys.

I mean, have you guys heard these guys?

Are you in Canada?

Do you know?

Is your show broadcast?

I know.

I've been through some provinces.

This is Saskatchewan.

Probably Saskatchewan.

Saskatchewan and the Northern provinces.

Yeah.

The territories, if you will.

Oh, these are big things.

Do you guys make one of those places?

Is that like Saskatchewan?

Is that like a feature?

I mean, I grew up there.

Oh, you're all careful.

So I can do it.

I can make that.

I believe that the place everyone makes one of this newfound land.

That's where all the dumb dums are.

Oh.

Is that true?

Tatiana.

Yes.

It's because they named their place the most obvious name.

We newfound it this place.

It was a real placeholder day that they never got around to filling in.

So you guys are, I'm reading some of your press materials here.

Oh, good.

Those got sent over finally.

Finally, yes.

I admit I didn't know anything about you before you got in here.

Thanks a lot, Scarsdale.

Thanks for studying.

But you guys have, you've been on the air for 40 years.

You're about to go into your 41st season.

That's right.

And you've been on since 1965, which is an amazing run.

Oh, don't remind me.

My feet are tired.

Wait, and you stand for that amazing run.

And you guys do marathons every day.

That's right.

Every single day.

Before you tape the show.

We run a marathon.

It's like so 2 p.m.

That's right.

Wait, after the show we do it?

Well, it's before the next day show.

Before the next day show.

Are you unsure?

I have a timeline question.

Yes, absolutely.

I've been doing this for 40 years.

That's great.

But in 1965.

That's right.

Was there a hiatus period of 10 years where you didn't?

Where you weren't on the air?

Oh, that's a good question.

Because the math is not adding up.

It's not adding up.

People have been driven crazy by this.

Here's what we do.

I always wondered what were those dark days?

Wow.

We do a year on a year off.

Sometimes we'll take two years off at a time.

Sometimes sometimes we'll spend a whole year running a marathon.

Oh, wait.

I sleep in a casket.

Well, I would think that you would be very afraid.

I'm afraid of suffocation because of that casket.

It's open.

Oh, okay.

I'm sorry.

It's an open casket out of respect for the family.

I have a baboon heart.

But are you doing these marathons with sheets over you?

Yes, of course we are.

Yes, we are.

But with high holes cut out.

No, a lot of people think we're ghosts.

Yeah, of course.

For these nighttime marathons.

Yes, we're running.

We have sheets over our heads.

Unsanctioned.

These are all set of marathons.

They're not real marathons.

The city does not support these.

How long are these supposed marathons?

They're the traditional marathon length.

26 point two miles.

Something miles.

10 hours.

Scarsdale is there by the side of the road with cups of water for us to pour over our sheets.

So you're doing like a wet sheet contest as well?

Well, it turns into a wet sheet contest.

I'll wait for it.

It's every year's sunny winds.

Wait, it's yearly.

We do it.

You do the races daily.

We do races daily.

We do the way.

So it's sort of cumulative.

You tally up the points at the end of the race.

That's exactly right.

At the end of the year.

That's exactly right.

Then we have a big banquet where we award medals.

So some days you're winning.

Some days, Sonny is winning.

No, Sonny always wins.

Oh, every single day.

Every single day.

Oh, but Scarsdale never races with you guys at all?

Scarsdale.

He can't run.

He's got terrible knees.

They're made of wood.

Were they replaced or were you born that way?

It's the word that way.

The lady Gaga.

Exactly.

That's what our song's about.

That's right.

Lady Gaga, we play a lot of Lady Gaga on our show.

We talk over it.

We talk over every single song.

Fantastic.

Scarsdale, you were born with wooden knees.

Yes.

Who are your parents?

What do you mean?

Scarsdale has got a collective.

He seems to be having a little bit of a very emotional topic for him.

What do you mean?

Who are my parents?

Obviously.

My parents.

Scarsdale.

Get on with yourself.

My father was Joe Pedo.

And my mother was Tinker Bell.

Oh.

So from two different Disney classics.

Yeah, that's what he said.

That's exactly what he said.

Great, great, great.

So they opened up the Disney vault and those two got together.

They boinked, as we say.

In the vault, I think.

Oh, really?

Yeah, you watched Song of the South.

Never coming out of that vault.

Never coming out.

He's got nothing else to do in that vault.

That's exactly right.

Yeah.

We used to sleep in a vault.

Yeah.

We got that tight.

Once we started making money.

That's what we developed to claustrophobia as well.

Maybe a little.

I love sleeping next to you.

I love sleeping next to you, Sonny.

My father in business, whom I have not married to.

Have you guys ever dated outside of this relationship?

I mean, obviously I dated him.

Oh, I married.

You're oh, you are married.

Wait, who are you married to?

Phil Collins, ever heard of him?

Well, the singer?

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

In the air tonight and.

Yeah, he's there.

Every night.

So he's sleeping next to you?

No, he's sleeping next to you.

No, no, no.

October, November, it's a wash.

Oh, no one like knows.

No one like knows, Bob.

No one like knows.

Don't hear me now.

This is September 28.

This is episode 378.

Just seven scant days later.

And this is an episode called Mailer Demon.

Oh boy, oh boy.

This is...

Is it Mailer Damon?

Damon, Mailer Damon, but he's...

You're all done.

I understand he's a demon.

I listen to this once.

The court stipulates that you've listened to the other ones once.

There's only one of his hoods.

Uh, let the record reflect.

They defended his lesson once.

This is Jason Manzukas, who we were talking about previously, and also Nick Crowell.

And now...

Also mentioned previously.

Uh huh.

Now, Jason J. Dog, Manzukas, he's been on the show a lot this year.

He was filming out of town the previous year.

A lot, so he couldn't be on.

And he came to me early in the year and said, I really want to make a concerted effort to be on the show more this year.

And we thank him a lot for that.

Because he loves doing it.

He loves doing it.

I love doing it with him.

Uh, there's a lot of people.

I love doing it with you.

I love doing it with Ben Schwartz.

I love doing it with all these people.

Do you love doing it with Khaleesi?

Do you hear the words coming out of my mouth?

I love doing it with them too kids.

Oh, those muppets gotta fuck Khaleesi.

Who?

Um...

I've done a whole 180 of this.

It's good now.

That's kind of a t-shirt.

It's good now.

Come on.

Yeah, maybe it's a t-shirt.

Uh, or is it good now?

Are those muppets gonna fuck Khaleesi's more of a t-shirt?

I know.

But I like it's good now.

It's good now.

Oh, it's good now.

It's good now.

Um, this is the mailer dayman and uh, this is one week after the previous.

Jason couldn't make good night in the morning.

He wasn't invited by the way.

Oh, really?

Yes.

He wasn't invited.

What would that have been like?

I don't know.

It would have upset the whole chemistry of the room probably.

He would have asked so many questions of Chasmin and Sunny.

Yeah, I bet.

Trying to force them into a weird corner.

That's right.

Um, he couldn't make that one.

I think he came this uh, one of the days.

We played.

Seven days later.

And uh, Kroll, also another guy who wanted to do the show more this year.

Um, I believe he is in three separate episodes this year as well as uh, including the recent uh, uh, Gil Fizan and Jourd St. Gitlin.

Did not want to be in my show so much this year.

Uh oh.

Dance.

Oh god, I'm glad he was making an effort to be on one show.

I think I may have just lucked out maybe, uh, and hit him uh, on a few days that he was available.

But um, so uh, we, uh, Kroll doesn't often come in and say, okay, this is what I want to do in this episode.

He, a lot of times what we'll do is I'll say, hey, is there anything you want to do?

He'll just go, I'll think of it while we do it.

And quite often, uh, as was the case in this episode, um, just something that we talked about in conversation.

He was, he was himself and Jason is himself the entire time.

Uh, Kroll will just leap in with an idea for a character.

Right.

This one was very successful and occurred the entire episode.

And this was just based off of us talking about wondering what those emails you get from the Mailer Damon were.

Right.

And he decided to portray the Mailer Demon or Damon, uh, to much success.

And uh, that is what we're- And great acclaim.

And that's what we're going to hear right now.

This is your number seven.

Number seven.

But what if Mailer Damon were to brandy?

Hello.

Yes.

Uh, Sam, do you mind getting the door?

Yeah.

All right.

Come in.

Hello.

Hello, sir.

Yes.

I am the Mailer Demon.

Oh my God.

We conjured him.

Oh, we said Mailer Damon about eight times, I believe in a hundred.

You say Mailer Damon eight times you conjured the Mailer Damon.

Yes, the thrives.

Welcome.

Thank you for having me.

You're so polite.

Thank you for knocking.

But as you all know, I am.

Most people just barge in.

I know I'm my-my-my man-as-how-what makes me the Mailer Damon for I was at one time the butler asked Geeves- Oh, wait a minute.

And after being possessed by a demon, I became the Mailer Damon.

Oh my God.

That's why you are dressed like an old school butler?

That is correct, sir.

Ockenin.

Thank you so much.

Your manners are impeccable.

Oh, wow.

Mr. Mansuchus.

Oh, yes.

I have prepared an egg-free omelet for you.

Really?

That's one of his things.

That's a thing.

How does that- How does Ask Geeves- Do you know the Mailer Damon know that?

Because you comb the internet for information.

That's all times and I have freed myself up to free things up for you.

So you are free to make the best of your comedy.

This is actually a dream come true.

So you know everything there is to know on the internet?

Yes, Mr. Ockenin.

Okay, well, let's ask him questions about the internet.

What have you always wanted to know?

Oh, man.

Let's just know everything that there is to know.

This is correct, Mr. Ockenin.

And I would say I was asked Geeves until I was possessed by a demon.

What is the distance between Chicago and San Francisco?

The distance is 1.7 thousand miles.

Wow.

Wow, that's so cool.

That's a little cooler than I would have thought.

So cool.

And it was so quick on it, right?

Yeah.

It was right there.

And I have gotten rid of the extra zeros so that you are not wasting time hearing- Oh, thank you.

Thank you, 1,700 miles.

And that's not a joke because I waste so much of my day looking at zeros.

Yeah, exactly.

I feel like I'm looking at one right now.

Ha ha ha.

For if it wasn't given the time, you wouldn't have come up with that beautiful joke together at the same time.

Ah.

My day say that you gentlemen have a wonderful sense of humor that you share in common.

Oh, thank you so much.

Thank you so much.

What a question, Mailer-Dameons.

What do you- What is that?

I'm just cutting your ass lightly, Mr. Hoffman.

I noticed that it could use a dream.

Thank you so much, James.

So Zee- Dame- Dame- Mailer- James, you call me James?

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Jason, can I talk to you for a second?

Yeah.

Well, you know, Mailer-Dameons will be right back.

Yeah, we'll be right back.

Hey, Jason, he was so polite.

I think that we totally glossed over that he's a demon.

I know we've got to be careful.

We literally have like a demon who can- Oh, he's really- Lemon sorbet.

Oh, thank you so much.

Such a nice, polite.

Nice to have a cleanser.

Wow.

What do you think of Bing?

Oh, Bing?

Yeah.

Well, I love Bing.

I've used it since day one.

I had a question I wanted to ask you.

Did you cut Scott's hair because you have access to all of the pictures of Scott and know what the correct length for- Face cover, giddy image searches from Scott's major appearances on red carpets.

And worse.

As well as a collection of all the best earworm photos.

Oh, yes.

I have collaborated with all of my various demonites to decide what is the ideal length for Scott's arkammon.

Oh, thanks.

What do you got?

Can you change my Wikipedia photo place to one where I'm not 30 pounds overweight?

Isn't this amazing that the tiny demons at Wikipedia will not allow us to change our photos yet?

Why?

Isn't that- And it used to be an older one.

Now they updated it to one that was like slightly two years newer, but it's still not a current.

Isn't it amazing what technology can do to ruin your fantasy?

I guess so.

Er, let me ask you, Kwej, did you snip off my hair because you needed my lock of hair for some other purpose?

It has nothing to do with that digital cauldron that I am doing to reverse the operations that I've created to let me rule the internet.

Oh my God, look at all those ones and zeros.

That digital cauldron.

Scott, Jason, I feel like he is doing something to ruin.

I think he is.

What else would he bring up the digital cauldron?

I don't know.

I don't know why he would bring that.

Do you say I think feel like we need a digital exorcist or something?

I don't know what's going on.

You know, I did take an online digital exorcism course.

You what?

Yeah, I did.

It's sort of like the universal life.

My friends asked you to digitally exorcist.

They don't want to get a Catholic in there.

Buffalo chicken dip.

Oh my gosh.

Oh.

You're so much.

You have some tortilla chips with this.

Yes, of course.

They're all gluten free for Scotty and egg free for single man's chukas.

Thank you so much.

This is delicious.

Oh, thank you so much.

Let's not get these mixed up.

Yeah, so Jason, I took an online digital exorcism course and I feel bad in what respect.

Yeah, I know.

It's really strange.

Nick is just sulking.

Nick is so bomb.

It's fine.

Nick, do you want to get in on this?

No, he does not interest me.

No, I thought it would be.

Look, he just might not know who you are.

No, he looked at me.

He said, hey man, I know your stuff.

I know his stuff.

Of course, of course.

How could you not?

How could you not know?

He's nearly ubiquitous in the comedy scene.

Sure.

It doesn't mean that I have to enjoy his work.

Wow.

Okay.

All right.

Yeah, for sure.

Hey, I had something I wanted to say to you, Miller Demon.

Yes.

I just, I kind of wanted to say the power of Steve Jobs compels you.

Leave this body.

Sorry, guys, that was me.

I had something in my story.

Yeah, you're all right, Nick.

You okay?

Yeah, no, he.

You're foaming at the mouth.

I was drinking a smoothie in it.

I got like a frozen banana.

That smoothie turned into a hearty.

No, but go on, Miss.

Yes.

Go on.

The power of another brilliant turn of phrase.

Yes.

The power of Steve Jobs compels you to leave the body of ass geez.

And I cast the back into the dark deep internet where thy belongs.

Ah, yes.

Yes.

Yeah.

I see what you have tried to do.

Yes.

What's that?

Who you have tried to exercise the demon that lives within me?

Yes.

Unfortunately, as Mr. Jobs has passed, it was never much of a power in the underlying functioning of the internet.

I knew a lot about design and aesthetics.

Exactly.

Exactly, sir.

But as far as zeros and ones, I would say the Wozniak name is the one that shall not be spoken.

Oh, okay.

All right.

Well, that's good to know.

I wonder if I should maybe repeat what I said with the Wozniak.

Maybe I'll do that.

It might be a trick.

It might conjure Steve Wozniak.

Oh, I mean, you look kind of a nice midjule up in the ball.

So refreshing.

Oh, my gosh.

This is refreshing.

I can try it if it conjures Steve Wozniak on my own.

All right.

Hey, I'm Aylur demon.

Yes.

I wanted to say something.

Yes.

Of course.

Well, I kind of felt like the power of Steve Wozniak compels the to leave the body of S.G.S.

and be cast out into the deep dark internet where that belongs.

Boom, boom.

Nick, what are you doing?

I'm just doing an impression of Roger Rabbit.

Roger Rabbit.

I thought it was Roger Rabbit.

I never realized how much Roger Rabbit sounds like a dialogue.

Boom, boom, boom, boom.

Anyway, I was trying to get Jeeves' Miller Damon's attention.

Oh, okay.

You just called his Jeeves.

He's just literally has his back to you.

Do you dare to call me Jeeves?

I wish you hadn't done that.

I shall smite you to the realm of Altavista.

Oh, no.

Not Altavista.

No, goodbye.

No, Nick, no, go, go, no.

Nick just disappeared into his actual phone computer.

Yeah.

Oh, my gosh.

Holy cow.

Bill Corn tortilla chip with a black bean salsa.

I am starting to feel full, but I don't mind if I do.

It's like when you go to a wedding, there's somebody tasty treats.

Oh, Yum City.

That didn't work.

And Steve Wozniak was not conjured.

I think we just kind of lean into this and feed you.

All right.

Well, now the next one.

We got to go deeper.

Hey, gentlemen, I could help it over here.

You whispering.

Oh, no.

Was there something that I was not providing for you?

No, you're doing great.

This is a great...

I love the menjoo.

Could I just ask you a question?

Yes.

As all I seem to do is serve you.

Why is it that you are trying to exercise me?

Well, you got really mad at Nick and you cast him into Altavista.

Yes.

You don't want that to happen to us.

And you're also like...

Well, I like your comedy.

Fair enough.

I'll take that.

I love how did this get me?

Oh, wow.

Thank you so much.

And comedy bang bang the shoe is my favorite.

The TV show, Northapod.

Northapodcast.

I enjoy the podcast.

You're like the opposite of everyone.

Yes, I am.

In fact, I am.

I would say it's of some concern to me that you have a digital cauldron and it's snipped off some of my hair.

But what do you plan to do with that?

Yeah.

Do you have a bigger plan, I guess, is the question?

You know, maybe we're trying to prevent some sort of future.

It's just you.

If you could just hold your chin straight, I'm just snipping out some of the grays from your beard.

Oh, wait a minute.

Wow, you look about 10 years younger.

Oh, my goodness.

58.

Sorry, you were saying something.

I don't want to interrupt you.

No, I just...

I can't help but feel like you're putting into action some sort of diabolical plan.

There's something, you know.

I mean, I don't need to characterize your plan as diabolical.

You have hairs from each of us now.

Right.

I'm wondering that your intentions are not to make us look better but are to exercise...

Are you sure that mine...

Some sort of...

My exercise.

Yeah.

Maybe I took a digital exercise class.

You brought a UX-er-size.

Tracy Anderson?

Yeah, I think it was.

Hey, do you need any pubes, by the way?

I'm looking to get these trimmed a little bit.

I wouldn't be opposed.

Alright, good.

Come on down here, if you mind.

Yep.

Gotta get rid of those pubers.

Yep.

No, I don't.

Do you?

Yep.

Really?

Yeah.

I can't tell if I do or not.

Yeah, I've got a couple of them.

I'm very blonde.

I don't like discussing my pubes on the air.

I don't mind if you cut them.

I don't want to talk about them.

Whoa, yeah.

I don't have people imagining my hair.

It's fine.

We don't have to talk about it.

You know what I mean?

Just imagine every other...

You don't have to imagine every other...

You don't have to imagine your pubes?

Yeah.

Just even admitting I have them seems strange.

What?

You are embarrassed to admit that you've gone through puberty and have pubic hair?

There should be like a menopause for men where we like...

There should not be.

Go go backwards.

There should not be.

Men's rights.

Thank you.

All right, Miley.

We deserve menopause as well.

You should talk to Bob Dick.

You're going to start talking about police lives matter.

Just heck of a...

Puba-biggle.

Okay, that's where I draw the line on eating.

I am not going to eat it.

I'm not going to eat it.

No, we're not determining what you serve.

Toil, toil, cubes and bubbles.

Oh.

I feel like I offered him that pubes and tied somehow into the incantation.

And let this be a warning to you, Bo.

It's just a warning.

If you defy the treats I provide you, we shall go to a commercial break.

Oh, look, I don't want to go to a commercial break.

We've only been going about 10 minutes or so at this point.

Maybe I better eat these puber bagels.

I guess we're going to eat these puber bagels.

Wait, which ones are these?

Oh, these are gray.

These must be Jason's.

Yeah.

I think I've got yours.

It's not bad.

It's not.

I mean, you, it's not an ingredient I would normally like to use like kale or sprouts or something like that.

It's a collision of flavors.

Yeah.

I'm sorry, you'd like to put kale and sprouts on your pizza bagels?

Not on.

I'm just saying in any recipe.

Ah.

How about a total weirdo?

Do you eat a lot of sprouts?

Yeah, I like sprouts.

Really?

Yeah.

You know, I know they taste like dirt or grass or something.

I can't remember the last time I ate a sprout.

Really?

Yep.

What about on a sandwich?

I saw a sandwich.

You guys have to crawl back in.

Hey, hey.

Yeah.

I was able to just keep the digital rub.

That was incredible.

I saw just like a hand almost like you were a cousin it coming out of your phone.

Yeah.

And then you just...

What did I miss?

What do you guys say about it?

Oh, we just ate each other's pubes on a bagel.

And then you know how you're talking about sprouts?

Yeah.

Pretty much.

Oh, fuck this.

You know, you're going back in.

He's going back into the digital cauldron.

Maybe he likes it in there.

At some point I want to interview the actor who does you though.

Oh, yeah.

The actor who the guy...

The actor who plays Jacob and Tookas.

Yeah, I think that would be really interesting.

I think...

Yeah, the guy's great.

Yeah, the guy is talented.

But I mean, I love your characterization.

What's his name?

Jeffrey Caricouetes.

Caricouetes.

Should we talk to him right now?

I would love to talk to Jeffrey Caricouetes.

Okay, Jeffrey, can you set aside the Jacob and Zugas persona for a second?

Shake it out.

Good.

Okay, here we go.

Jeffrey, hey Jeffrey.

Hey guys, we're doing great.

Pretty good.

What's happening?

How's it going?

I really...

I don't believe I've ever spoken to you on this.

This show's going really good.

Yeah, you're really funny.

I'm really happy with it so far.

I've never spoken to you on air.

I don't believe.

Oh, it's so weird.

We talked so much in person.

Yeah.

But yeah, I know you're right.

This is a lot like that James Adomean episode where he was himself for a while.

Yeah, that's weird.

Yeah, it is weird.

You're like when you talk to Paul F. Tompkins on the best ofs.

It's a little weird talking to you right now, but it's not that weird.

You talk all the time.

Can you tell us about your background?

You've come up with such a deranged sort of repulsive character.

Oh, I mean, that's just Jason, you know.

Yeah, but you're not...

So you think of him as like a real person.

Well, you know, you have to.

You have to think of the person you're playing as a real person.

Otherwise it's almost impossible to play them.

Can I ask you a question?

Yeah.

When did you come up with the egg allergy?

Yeah.

It's something no one has.

Was that the ahoma?

It was years.

Guys, I for years was doing this character without an egg allergy and could not get it off the ground.

No, it wasn't sticky.

People couldn't get into it.

But the inherent vulnerability of the egg allergy mixed with the utter reprehensible nature of the character's point of view.

It balances it out.

Yeah, exactly.

It really does something.

And you're not allergic to eggs, you're eating one right now.

No, oh, I eat eggs all the time.

Yeah.

And to answer your question, it was in a groundlings class.

Oh, they're great.

It was in a groundlings class.

You know, because one of the teachers was like, find something scary.

Yeah, how long were you a groundling?

Are you in Sunday company?

I never got that far.

Oh, okay.

You just took my stuff.

You took level.

Yeah, they...

The minute I came up with the egg allergy, they were like, you graduated.

Wow!

They don't even want you on this stage.

I don't care.

And then you went to UCB.

And then I went to New York and I started doing UCB.

Wow.

So exclusively as Jason Manzukas.

That's Jason Manzukas.

Because I realized that Jeffrey, character Wheaties.

Yeah.

No one's interested yet.

Nobody's interested.

It's like a Paul Rubens, Peewee Herman situation.

Everyone says that at the groundlings, he had so many great characters, but he just wanted to stay away with the determines.

I left Los Angeles.

I shed every piece of Jeffrey.

And I arrived in New York as Jason Manzukas did not have that.

Now, Jeffrey character Wheaties is paler skin.

Yep.

You have a lot of makeup on right now.

And a fake beard.

Oh, it's always a fake beard.

Yeah.

Do you want to take off the beard?

I'd love to get a look at your real face.

Are you going to want me to do Jason later in the show?

Yeah.

But I have some spirit gum right here.

So you won't do Jason?

Oh, man.

You were so handsome without that.

Oh, thank you.

Why do you hand hold it?

Toe tip toe tip toe.

Hello, man.

Oh, mille demon.

Mele demon.

He ran out of here with your beard.

Your fake beard.

Oh, brother.

Wow.

He loves hair.

And we're on the internet.

Would you like it if someone were to make a t-shirt or image of Jason character Wheaties, like on a Wheaties box?

Like Jeffrey character Wheaties?

Yes.

Jeffrey character Wheaties.

And I think I've seen a picture of one of Jason's oldest headshots.

I believe is a picture of you character Wheaties.

That's my headshot.

Before.

Yeah.

That was your headshot, but people have a rounded.

You would have found it.

Dark in the skin slightly.

Yes.

Slightly.

But it still looks, it's in black and white.

It looks a little light.

It looks very, very handsome.

That's my, that was Jeffrey character Wheaties's first headshot.

And people dug it up and they attributed it to you because obviously they're happy matches.

Luckily, I managed to put the name Jason Manzukas on it.

Right.

So that I, now as long as it's on the internet, people like the male or demon, they know that it's Jason, not Jeffrey.

What have you used to?

So digitally, I don't exist.

What are you actually like?

I mean, you're so different from Jason.

Such a good question.

I find him to be a fucking drip.

He is kind of annoying, isn't he?

Right.

Yeah.

It's like sometimes you meet an actor who you love and then you talk to them and you're like, oh, that person is nothing.

That happened to me really recently with you.

With me and crawl.

Yeah.

No, that's fair.

I'm going to go to the bathroom.

No, I'll be back in a second.

No, no.

Yes.

Hello.

Oh, for breeze for breeze.

Yes.

Hello.

What are you doing here?

A beloved character.

Are you?

I'm so excited.

Have you finished stocking up our craft service table out there?

Put out all the tiny little tiny little street cheeses.

Thank you so much.

I'll put out everything.

Jeffrey.

Wait, you know, Jeffrey.

I love Jeffrey.

Jeffrey, you know.

Thank you.

Oh, I know Jeffrey.

Character Wheaties.

Oh, really?

I see this motherfucker on every set that Jason Mazukas is an actor one.

Relax.

This motherfucker.

Let me tell you one thing.

You motherfucker.

Okay.

Relax.

This motherfucker has complained.

I'm just saying him sprinkling pubes on my character.

I'm on my table.

David.

And then saying...

Jeffrey, you sprinkle pubes on.

It's more an act of aggression than it is a food source.

That's right.

It's an act of aggression.

You try to get me fired off every job I've been on.

Why don't you guys like each other?

I don't care for breeze for breeze.

No, this motherfucker.

This motherfucker.

What don't you like about him?

Do you think that he's some sort of stereotype or something of a bygone age?

That's right.

He wants to put me back in 2005.

But don't you realize that people still are like this?

I still exist.

And I am more powerful and I am elegant and I am dreamt.

We all can't excel at long-term character work.

Oh, that's...

You are one of the best at it.

That's right.

Oh, that's right.

Just because he created a three-dimensional character who's allergic to eggs.

He gets to live forever.

He does ask you this, does Febreze, Febreze have any vulnerabilities whatsoever?

Well, that's a good point.

No, it's true.

The one thing I'm allergic to is assholes.

Do you mean people who are assholes or people's assholes?

People's assholes!

And I'll tell you this.

Jeffery character Wheaties is one big old butthole.

That's an interesting question, Febreze.

I've never seen you have any sort of vulnerability.

It's not that it's true.

You have things that you like to do which is co-treat.

When you have grown up with this voice, this attitude in the places I grew up, you big old wall like the Berlin wall.

You're very defensive.

Right, I am carton.

But I bet it's all because of...

Underneath I'm a little pussy cat.

Yeah.

That's right.

Do you ever get vulnerable with a loved one?

Yeah, all the time I let my lovers walk all over me.

Oh, yeah.

Wait a minute.

I'm not going to talk about it.

Are you familiar with their story about the well?

I mean, they got famous.

Oh, that's all that that is.

That's all that that is.

That's all that you're generating.

All you care about is going viral.

Yeah.

Listen, my name is Birdman.

Yeah.

And I'm against you.

Hey, they're the original going viral, baby.

Oh, sure.

Nurse Ray Rhimes are the original going viral.

That is a T-shirt.

That is absolutely a T-shirt.

It's good now.

Do you think a T-shirt is that is a T-shirt?

Maybe.

Let's experiment.

How about it?

Do you want to get with this dumb shit?

I don't know.

That is a T-shirt.

That was a lot of fun with those guys.

I really enjoyed doing that.

And we're going to end at this point.

We're going to...

Sad.

It's very sad.

It's Christmas Eve in Hollis, Queens.

Foskka, Chicken and Collegrines, though.

I will say that.

What would they say in that movie?

In that song when they describe all these things?

I think songs are movies.

I think they're little movies you can't see.

If they paint a great enough picture.

Yeah.

They're little movies you're listening to through a door.

That's what songs are.

That's what songs are to me.

They talk about all the different things that indicate it's Christmas.

Sure.

And one of them is the hawk is out.

What does that mean?

I don't know.

It may be something specific to Hollis, Queens.

Do they're cultures?

Do they're curious and unique cultures?

I will say that's how I learned what collard greens were when that song came out.

From that song?

Yeah, from that song.

Yeah, I was like, what are they saying?

Collard beans?

What's a collard bean?

A bean with a collar on it.

Yeah, so I looked it up.

Picture bean wearing a little jacket.

A cream-colored jacket.

I'm a ziggy.

Oh, this fellow.

He comes from...

Hey fellow.

He comes from...

My name is Arthur Fellow.

Abernathy Fellow.

A fellow.

I'd like to imagine a bean wearing a cloak or a cream-colored jacket.

Is it Dr. Fellow?

Is it Mr. Fellow?

It's Professor Fellow.

Professor Fellow, really.

It's not a title.

Oh, okay.

Bestowed upon by you?

Yes.

Okay, can I ask why?

I wrote a letter to myself, addressing myself as Dr. Fellow.

Oh, like Professor Fellow.

Like the WGA, copywriting something.

Yes, hello.

Why are you wondering about this?

Why are you thinking about this?

I like to say, well, because I like to put a face to my food.

I'm feeling so fine.

You're actually eating something alive and killing it?

Yes, because I...

It's forbidden to do so.

I say, you mustn't eat living things.

Can I just say that you are a weirdo?

Oh, is that your...

Well, that sounds like a t-shirt.

That was a song.

That was a movie.

It was a movie you listened to through a door.

All right, we gotta go.

All right.

This Christmas Eve, have a great holiday.

We're gonna be back here on Monday with part three of the Countdown.

And we're gonna take you out.

We're gonna play the solo solo, olympic song challenge.

We're gonna play someone, set that to music.

Oh, good.

So a backing track with strings and everything.

So we're gonna play that on our way out.

They hired an orchestra.

Yeah, 90 piece orchestra.

We'll see you next time.

Thanks, bye.
